00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.750
Of the Avatars of Maha Vishnu, the Fourth
One is the Narasimha Avatar.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.809
If there are any children here, careful!!

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.730
Something really frightening is coming up!

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.050
Snap!!

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.320
This Avatar, Narasimha Avatar..

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.630
Anger.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.750
The very representation of Anger.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.990
Justified Anger.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.710
The boy tells his dad, Hiranyakashyap..

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.440
“He will be in this pillar.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.700
He will be in this little speck of dust.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.090
You cannot destroy Him.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.090
He is the Greatest.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.630
He is everywhere!

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.630
He is EVERYWHERE.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.630
Don’t mess with him!

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.559
He will beat the living daylights out of you!

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.770
Beware!”…

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:09.950
There is a 
message there!

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.560
Namasthe!

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.180
Digitally!

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.900
Digit — Ally!

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.450
Friend!

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.710
This is Claude Shannon.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.670
The Father of the Information Age, they call
him.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.829
He didn’t win the Nobel Prize..

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.860
Didn’t become a celebrity like Richard Feynman
or Albert Einstein.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.689
But, the Father!

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.500
And, not for nothing!

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:00.440
Way back in 1948, he sowed the seeds of everything
digital that even today, seventy years later,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.420
we are paying homage to him.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.079
He is a scientist!

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.270
He invented a new field called Information
Theory.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.370
And, just like our old friend Newton did,
to further the science that he invented, he

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.900
realised that a new kind of mathematics was
needed, and he went ahead and formulated the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.629
mathematics needed for probabilistic communication
theory.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.629
Simple!

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.629
Elegant!

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.629
Profound!

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.629
And, not just that..

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.239
If you flip through this book, you will learn
too..

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.099
A Mind At Play — He was an engineer also
it seems.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.069
An amazing engineer.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.069
Unique combination!

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.680
A scientist, a mathematician, and an engineer.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.420
He has even engineered a maze-solving mechanical
mouse!

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.769
Way back!!

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.159
Seventy years ago!

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.099
He is supposed to be the person who first
used the word “Bits”.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.099
Binary Digits.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.110
He confesses, “It wasn’t me.. a colleague
had used it in an internal memo, and I kinda

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.110
borrowed it..”

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.110
But, bits.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.110
Information.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.110
Noise versus Signal.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.270
What is the theoretical maximum speed with
which a channel can take information, and

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.799
so on, he was the one who laid out first.

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.819
But..

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.629
Is he the originator of this “Bit” concept?

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.879
Let’s go a BIT earlier in time…

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.800
This man..

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.680
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.909
What all has be been in life?

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.120
Well..

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.340
Historian.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.550
Lawyer.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.769
Philosopher.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:51.980
Mathematician.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.200
Theologist.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.270
Talked about God and godliness.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.910
Physicist too!

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:10.720
This person, among the many many many things
he has done… he has a veritable museum of

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.760
things that he has left behind!

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.130
It contains letters, papers, unpublished content..
all his creation.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:27.270
There, they found out that he had published
papers about digits.. not the ten-finger decimal

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:38.060
system type, but the binary (based on 0 and
1)… a mathematics that talked about binary

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.419
addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication!

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.419
Factoring!

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.090
But, was there any earthly use for this at
that time?

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.509
Too long ago..

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.509
1703.

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.340
Even electricity isn’t prevalent yet.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.910
Magnetism, people haven’t figured it out
well yet.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.570
Those were the times.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.090
And, our man launches into lectures on Binary
Mathematics!

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.539
Shall we call this person the Father?

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.340
OR…

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.750
Should we go a bit earlier in time?

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.520
A LONG bit?!

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.940
Do you remember THIS person?

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.710
Lord Krishna.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.790
The Eighth Avatar of Lord Vishnu.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.330
And, this?

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.100
Arjunan.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.680
The Bhagavad Gita, the book inside the book
of the Mahabharatha..

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.419
In Chapter Two itself, the 23rd Verse goes
like this.

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:47.440
A beautiful shloka — some of you may remember
and recall.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.550
Nainam Chindanthi Shastraani.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.680
Don’t think your weapons can affect This
in any way!

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.860
Your weapons can’t even touch It.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.850
Nainam Dahathi Paavakaha..

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.449
Burn It with fire?

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.599
Nope!

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:08.750
Untouchable!

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.880
Na Chainam Kledayanthyaapo..

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.880
Aapo..

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.880
Water.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.100
Don’t think you can wet It with water either.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.490
Na Shoshayathi Maaruthaha.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.900
The wind can’t dry It either!

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:30.940
Your weapons can’t touch It, fire can’t
destroy It, water can’t inundate It, wind

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.919
cannot dry It.

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.569
What is this IT?

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.470
Lord Krishna calls it the Soul..

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.819
“The people standing in the battlefield
against you, your uncles, your brothers, … don’t

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.630
think they are your relatives…

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.139
don’t think you are going to harm them with
your weapons…

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.460
Nothing can touch their Soul!”

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.870
That originating thought..

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:59.900
It runs for 18 chapters, but, early in the
book, Lord Krishna sets this out with great

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.900
clarity.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:07.460
Is this then, the originating point for the
concept of … something that represents a

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.310
human being that is indestructible?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.410
Something that stands firm, even after they
are long gone?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.860
Those bits of data?

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.080
Those details?

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.960
Perhaps, is that what this “Soul” thing
is?

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.490
Or… should we go even further?

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.350
Remember this person?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.750
This is the Fourth Avatar.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:42.150
The boy, Prahaladha, says:- “You can’t
do anything to Him.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.229
He is everywhere!

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:48.310
You are surrounded by Him!

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.120
Don’t mess with Him!

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.479
He will beat the living daylights out of you!

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:57.580
(Unnai undu illainnu aakkiduvaar!

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.580
— Tamil!)”

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.669
Undu — Yes, alive.

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:03.000
Illai — No, dead.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.550
Undu — 1.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.099
Illai — 0.

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:08.520
Zeroes and Ones.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.250
Digitise!

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.700
That’s it!

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:24.060
So, .. this could probably be the originating
moment when we started understanding .. “Who

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.350
is a person”?

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:35.149
Perhaps the question is just about what the
legacy is that they leave behind!

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:44.080
Their written words, spoken words, their actions
perhaps, memories, all of that can be digitised..

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.760
We have encountered this idea earlier too.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.300
I will place jump cards at the end of this
episode.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.610
So, go, watch them too!

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.090
You will realise that we have talked about
this already.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.519
But, there is so much more to say!

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:05.320
One of the interesting things that we can
take away, as a blessing, probably also as

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.210
a curse, thanks to this digitisation of everything,
is this!

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.740
Take a look at this!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.120
This is a video file!

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.430
Could well be this video itself!

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:26.340
If I digitise it completely, in a way that
I can store it easily in a computer, or transmit

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:32.290
it easily through a network, this is how it
looks.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.529
Zeroes and Ones…

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.980
Actually compressed into letters A through
F also.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:43.769
0 to 9, A to F. All sorts of combinations
within those, encoded and buried.

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:47.720
Okay, how about a book?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.730
An ePub book version 3, will look like this.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:59.070
Again, a combination of letters and numbers!

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.190
Transferable!

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.019
At the speed of light!

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.310
Doesn’t weigh anything!

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.590
Doesn’t occupy space!

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.899
Can be shared with others!

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:15.709
Without affecting the original!

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:17.590
Can be made copies of!

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.750
That look exactly like the original!

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.130
Okay, how about a picture!

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:29.880
A picture like the ones I have posted here,
above, in this video screen..

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:37.460
Again, the moment you bring it down to the
level of bits and bytes, you cannot even tell

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.460
what they are!

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.480
Here is one more example!

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.389
This is a song!

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:46.220
This song too, will appear like this only.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.880
Actually, this “internet”, that we are
all so happily, joyously, freely, enjoying?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.649
A very important reason for it to remain free
in this commercialised world?

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:58.149
A world where clean water and healthy air
is being SOLD for money…

00:10:58.149 --> 00:11:00.080
how come the Internet is nearly free?!

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.440
Have you thought about it?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.660
Well, this is the secret.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:08.959
If only the Internet operators could reliably
guess that the file you are transferring at

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:14.660
this moment is a video… the action you are
performing at the moment currently is a live

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:21.410
phone call… the document you are demanding
from there is just a plain textbook, this

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:27.889
is just a chat message, and could do such
a differentiation, at the level of the packet,

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:29.810
they will fleece you!

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.540
Burn a hole through your wallet!

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.660
It is too costly for the gatekeepers to keep
track of who is passing through the gate,

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.870
they are allowing everybody in..

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.389
Well.. just for a little longer only..

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:44.450
In a few years time, new technology will arrive.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.480
An IPv6, a priority bit..

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.200
And, once they are stabilised, they will be
able to find out whether it is a video stream,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.170
a text file, a book, a chat message, and according
to that format, just like they charge differential

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:03.870
fees for heavy vehicles (three hundred rupees!)
and two-wheelers (free pass!) in a highway

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:09.470
toll gate, but till then, enjoy the internet..
because, everything when abstracted to the

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:15.279
layer of Digits, bits and bytes, looks like
this!

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:22.440
Oh, one more big advantage because of this
abstractability!

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:30.610
If everything can be brought into a format
like this, from A to here, from B to here,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:38.820
from C too here, .. then, how would it be
if I get it from A and give it out as B?

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.589
Shall we take a look?!

00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:41.589
This?

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:42.589
Is Pi.

00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:55.790
If you’ve been watching Quotidians, you’ll
surely know what Pi is!

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.230
This is…

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:07.690
The Sound of Pi!

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.840
Random!

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.630
Never repeating!

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.630
Going on forever!

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.630
How?

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.520
Well, just replace a musical note uniquely
for every digit!

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:24.210
Once that association is done, if you take
something that you received from mathematics…

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.210
bits and bytes.. and you supply that to an
audio instrument?!

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.880
This is what you get!

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.900
Well, this is nothing compared to my next
exhibit!

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.910
Take a look at this person!

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.490
His name is Neil Harbisson.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.529
This is his passport photo.

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:43.510
Have you ever seen anybody wearing headphones
and other headgear in a passport photo??

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.980
They will let THIS guy though.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.980
Why?

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:56.509
That would be because he is not WEARING technology,
he is not USING technology, he is WITH technology!

00:13:56.509 --> 00:14:01.779
If you ask him his height, he won’t give
you a measurement up to the top of his head!

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:04.770
It would include the antenna and camera dangling
ABOVE his head!

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.310
Because, this is how he looks in real life!

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.800
And, that is because, Neil Harbisson has a
rare disease called achromatopsia.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
Complete colour-blindness!

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.760
Imagine living a life that looks like old
and grainy black-and-white movies of yore!

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:28.759
He joined hands with a few researchers and
actually came up with a system that would

00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:36.889
allow him to HEAR colours.

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:39.449
The ability to HEAR colours.

00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:45.080
That third eye camera dangling in front of
his forehead?

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.980
Wherever he points that, whatever colour it
is in, he will HEAR that sound!

00:14:50.980 --> 00:15:03.420
So, if he has to go to a funeral…, he will
wear a combination of orange and purple, it

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.420
seems.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.420
Why?

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.790
That is because it sounds like a mournful
melody.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:17.430
He had given a TED talk way back in 2012.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.339
Wearing this head-dress embedded in the back
of his head.

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:26.070
And, when he got on to the stage, that RED
of TED?

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.560
This is how it sounded to him.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.720
That’s how he hears..

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.089
no.. sees, TED!

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:45.580
If he listened to Mozart, he calls it a yellow
experience!

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:51.420
If he heard the old ring tone of a rotary
phone?

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.420
Green!

00:15:52.420 --> 00:16:00.040
A person who brought sounds to the world of
colours, … now sees colour when he hears

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040
sounds!

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.310
Do you get it?

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:10.280
This is possible because digits do not have
“types” or “categories”.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.000
They are digits.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.170
Binary.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.279
Zero and One.

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.610
Black Mirror.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:20.639
We have visited this series in Netflix quite
a few times.

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:23.100
There is an episode called The History of
You.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.529
A fear-inducing spine-chilling episode.

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:32.170
A small contact lens placed over your eye,
records EVERYTHING.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:38.650
Who they talk to, what they say, where they
sit, where they go, … everything is recorded.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:43.550
Even after a person dies, the lens can be
retrieved and data replayed!

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:50.009
It is a true “life journal”.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:54.870
It becomes a police criminal case, and I don’t
want to give away too much.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.079
Please watch this episode!

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:59.380
Basically, the reverse also is possible.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:06.429
In another Black Mirror episode, when you
see somebody, you get a lot of information

00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:07.429
about them..

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:10.449
They have attempted it with Google Glass.

00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:13.800
Many other companies have attempted this too.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.910
Smart glasses.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:20.900
There are many whistleblowers who complain
that this is a violation of privacy..

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.809
That this is not safe.

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:25.990
I am one of them too, at times!

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.880
But… this is happening, folks!

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.870
This is going to happen.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.320
We are entering a world that is filled…

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.340
(Remember Prahalada?

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.360
Data EVERYWHERE.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.890
In the pillar..

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:43.000
In the speck of dust too!

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.900
Nothing can be done to it!

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.530
Undu Illainnu…)

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:57.220
But…, out of the panic and the fear borne
out of this, .. something else has started

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.220
happening.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.220
Everybody wants to leave!

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.890
One guy wants to delete his Instagram account.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.480
Another wants to exit Twitter.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.290
I want to quit Facebook says another..

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.360
Hey, wait…

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.040
You don’t need to quit.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.720
Mark himself may fire you..!

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.470
Jokes apart, this has started happening too!

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.240
One of my good friends?

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.409
They will declare to me — “I am shutting
down Whatsapp.

00:18:26.409 --> 00:18:32.650
I have deleted the App..” — and they will
return a week later.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.549
Back to the App.

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:39.020
There is another friend of mine.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.020
Remember this App?

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.020
A search engine like Google.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.020
But, not Google itself.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.460
A search engine that doesn’t take anything
from you.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.929
But, gives you search results..

00:18:45.929 --> 00:18:47.510
Quality may be… below par.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:54.930
But, I will not steal any personal data from
you!

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.270
Privacy matters!

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.330
Yes, the exodus has started.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.690
In fact, this is Pavel Durov.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.370
CEO of Telegram.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:11.640
He is posting promotional messages, inviting
people to move to Telegram, calling Whatsapp

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640
evil!

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.900
I am not mocking at these people.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:24.409
I realise that I am probably giving away some
information about myself that may come back

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:28.400
to bite me, I don’t know..

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.240
But, I go back to that “necessary evil”.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.870
We are entering a world filled with data.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:41.530
Those who store and use this data… we need
to hand this over only to trustworthy parties.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:47.840
But.. saying you will never part with data,
that you will always use only incognito windows

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.700
for browsing, always erasing your digital
footprints and fingerprints…

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:59.400
well, the only feeling I get when I see you
do this is, “You are either paranoid, or

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.500
you are a criminal!”

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.400
Socrates said this long ago.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.610
Thousands of years ago.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:13.120
The undocumented life, the unexamined life,
is not worth living!

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.750
You must look back at what you have done,
the path you have come in, .. once in a while,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:18.750
he says!

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.090
And, a way to see that?

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.110
All these tools!

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:28.780
Not just looking back at what you have done,
yourself, but what others have done too.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.560
There is an App like this.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.809
A website.

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:35.950
Story Corps is the name.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.970
This company specialises in recording stories.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.520
You can take this App to your grandma’s
place.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.260
Ask her, “What did you want to become, as
a young girl?”

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.210
“Can you sing your favourite song just once
more please?”

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.690
“When you married Grandpa, what was his
first loving message to you?”

00:20:54.690 --> 00:21:00.240
When you ask a couple of questions like these,
when the conversation starts flowing, and

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:07.040
gets recorded, and you can store it in a public
library, or in your own library, private,

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.400
but when that starts flowing, … this is
culture!

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.679
This will remain after you are long gone..

00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:20.120
This is your…

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.680
SOUL!

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.980
This is your soul!

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.620
Saying you won’t gift this to humanity…

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:33.580
saying, you won’t leave this behind in a
way my descendants can see and enjoy and learn

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.580
from…

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.840
I feel it is probably not right.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.850
1984.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.850
A famous book.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:41.850
By George Orwell.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:48.900
Many say, there is a quote from the author,
like this, in that book:- “The most effective

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.029
way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate
their own understanding of their history.”

00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:54.740
You don’t need weapons to destroy them!

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.010
Just make them lose touch with their own past.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.990
Ponniyin Selvan, the book, has been around
for quite a long time.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:08.080
But, until it appeared as a popular movie,
many didn’t know that such a grand temple

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:18.059
existed, that the kings had achieved so much,
that they had crossed oceans and reached foreign

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:27.690
lands.. that history.. and that history is
not just written by the winners, history of

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:36.529
the losers, history of the common man, history
of the person on the street, that oral history

00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:39.279
has to be captured..

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:42.200
And to capture that?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.470
Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, .. everybody
plays an important role.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.050
They are capturing something.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.419
Probably they are misusing the data that they
are collecting.

00:22:53.419 --> 00:22:57.059
Probably we should leave Facebook and Twitter.

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:03.020
But, we need to be part of systems that are
this collective group.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.670
The group where each of us gets to contribute
one little data droplet.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.880
This wasn’t there in the original book.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:16.779
The quote goes like this actually:- “Who
controls the past controls the future.

00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:22.070
Who controls the present controls the past!”

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.220
But, means the same…

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:33.190
So, rule the past, change history!

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.070
As a closing thought, there is this product
called Ultrahuman.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.490
I have been reading amazing reviews about
it.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.490
Indian product.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.490
Bengaluru-based.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.370
It is a ring you can wear.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.360
You can even gift it to your wife.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.410
It tracks a lot of things!

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.789
From your heart rate, and …… so on..

00:23:56.789 --> 00:24:00.929
All the way to the “Documented Self” that
we saw earlier..

00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:02.880
The digital version of you!

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.440
Small steps forward towards that grand dream!

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:12.950
Far better and advanced than the Apple Watch!

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.950
I hear my wife telling me..

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:21.720
Was it for this silly thing that you put out
a full episode??

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.020
Come home, and let me take care of this once
and for all!

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.290
Anyway, we will meet again soon!

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.820
Thank you!
