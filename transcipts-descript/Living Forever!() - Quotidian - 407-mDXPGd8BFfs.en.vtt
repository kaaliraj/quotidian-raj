00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.700
Do you remember this amazing song from the
Badshah movie?

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.340
He will divide Life itself, into eight parts!

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.991
The first eighth would be about playing.

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:13.680
The second eighth would be about education.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.800
Then you get married.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.619
Then you get a baby.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:25.920
Then you start collecting wealth, you go around
the world, and probably take rest for a while,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.550
but, please don’t live past sixty-four!

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.820
Because, you won’t get inner peace otherwise…

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.079
He had laid it out thus, eight eights!

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.190
That is the Life of Man.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:58.649
And, find out which eighths you are actually
currently in!

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.390
Namaste!

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.890
Living Forever!!

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.000
Can we live forever?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.390
Should we live forever?!

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.810
Will we want to live forever??

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.359
Steve Jobs, in 2005… at Stanford, he had
given a Commencement Speech.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.520
It is still 2005!

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.049
Which means the iPhone is not out yet!

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.299
He hasn’t scratched the surface of all the
amazing things he was going to do!

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.280
At that time, he delivered an amazing speech.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.270
Some even call it the Most Watched Commencement
Speech!

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.610
He delivered it in three parts.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.369
The first part talked about “Connecting
the Dots”.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.569
Then it was about “Love and Loss”.

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.429
The third part though…!

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.780
It talked about “Death”.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.410
Specifically, he says, “Death?

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.530
Death is perhaps the greatest invention, the
single best invention of Life…!”

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.230
I will live on…

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.730
And, every day, standing in front of the mirror,
I would ask myself, “What if this were my

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.300
last day on Earth?”

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.829
“If I knew today was the day, would I still
do what I am setting out to do?”

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.209
If, for too many days at a stretch, I receive
answers like “No”, “Not at all”, “Never”,

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.450
I will go back, I will change my plan, he
said!

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.870
Death is also something that exposes you.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.769
No external pressure.

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.810
No unnecessary ego!

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.590
You are already naked, he says!

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.970
Every one of you is going to die!

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.150
If only you get that clarity of thought, you
will understand that there are a few things

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.519
you are here to do, and you should focus on
those, and don’t bother about what others

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.749
are going to say!

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.180
You will remember!

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.810
Time is limited, so, don’t waste it living
the life that somebody else wants you to live.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.579
That amazing quote came from this speech,
actually!

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.189
What was he trying to say?

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:45.799
A man who has been diagnosed of cancer…
he was saying, Death gave me great clarity!

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.470
Time is limited, and Death gave me the amazing
clarity about what to focus my energies on.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:58.030
Those classic “Thousand Nos” that we often
talk about, came from this speech!

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:08.260
I had to choose, and I chose only the best
things, only the things that I can do best!

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.480
Some of you will know that I am reading the
Mahabharatha, as written by Mr. Jeyamohan.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.470
A book series titled Venmurasu.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.330
He had written one chapter a day, from the
year 2014.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.860
Venmurasu, in twenty-six books, 25,000 pages.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:36.500
I have been posting, everytime I finished
a book, reading it aloud with my mom, I would

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.729
post a photograph of it on Social Media.

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.340
Now, I am reading the 13th book.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.680
Of the 26.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.180
The 13th book is titled Maamalar.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:57.050
And, in that book, it is basically the story
of Bheema, who sets out, to get that amazing,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.960
unusually scented flower because Draupadi
wanted it.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.580
And, it is about his interesting adventures..

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.580
That book.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:16.090
In this book, Maamalar, there is one part,
oh my God, Jeyamohan has given me such a beautiful

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.639
chapter, relevant for today’s topic.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.210
And that is about Oorvashi.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.310
Oorvashi and Pururavas.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.060
Pururavas is a King.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.490
He falls in love with the Heavenly Nymph,
Oorvashi.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.960
And, Oorvashi too, is drawn to the King Pururavas.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.389
And, they send her down to Earth.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:45.099
A punishment of sorts, for falling in love
with an Earthling.

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:54.400
But, Devaloka is missing the amazingly beautiful,
the perfect damsel, Oorvashi.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.250
They want her back.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.080
To bring Oorvashi back, they send seven Gandharvas.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.669
These seven Gandharvas go, look around, see
what she is doing, and come back to report

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:10.669
to Indra.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.190
They say, “Sorry to say this, but you should
stop hoping.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.659
We don’t think she is ever going to come
back”.

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:20.659
What happened?

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:25.039
Why wouldn’t Oorvashi return back to Indraloka?!

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:30.699
Each Gandharva gives a reason.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.449
Let us listen to those reasons!

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.820
Why wouldn’t Oorvashi return?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:43.710
The first Gandharva, by name Vishwavasu, he
says, “Vaazhum Akkanam Meelaadhu…

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.300
You folks are living in Eternal Time.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:55.509
Those folks there, every one of them realises,
this second that is passing by, they can’t

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:56.509
get it back.

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.790
That moment isn’t coming back.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.790
Ever.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.790
It was here.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.790
It is now gone.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.790
Forever.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:07.009
So, they are always in the pleasurable panic
of ‘I need to make good use of this moment

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.009
now!’

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.300
Those things can’t be reproduced here.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.449
Sorry, so, she won’t come here.

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.389
She is really enjoying it back there!”

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:22.669
Another guy, Chandrahasan, what does he say?

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.550
“Ninaivil Meelum Thuyaram…

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.110
You folks don’t have memory here.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.500
For you live in Infinite Time.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.350
In Forever Time.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.830
You don’t have Memories of the Past.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.120
To chew cud on.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.740
But, these Earthlings?

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:46.020
They regret about the happenings of the Past,
they recall the Past, they bring back the

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:52.639
nostalgic ones, and wow, the kind of joy and
the kind of pain they get, they will not want

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.849
to miss it, and so, she won’t be coming!”

00:07:57.849 --> 00:07:59.710
Another Gandharva comes.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.970
Prabhahasan.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.770
“Naalai Enum Perunkanavu…

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.840
That is what they are swimming joyfully in.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.909
A dreamland called Tomorrow.

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:08.259
You have no Future.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:13.870
In Devaloka, the Past and the Future are melded
into one continuous Infinite Present.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.330
But, back there?

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.169
They dream of a Future.

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:21.060
A Grand Dream.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.539
Will it happen?

00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:24.680
How will it happen?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.199
What all can we do?

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:28.330
What will result if we do this?

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.909
They spend a lot of time in this grand dreaming,
and they wouldn’t want to miss it for the

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:34.500
world!

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.500
One more guy comes.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.500
Suphrahasan.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.500
What does he say?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.950
“We seem to think that everybody has two
eyes on their face.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.040
They actually have a Third Eye.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.440
The one of Imagination.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.980
For you, the Dream is Reality.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.842
You can dream anything into reality, sir.

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:54.060
The Devas are all-powerful.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.000
You can Dream and make it happen . So, there
is no distinction between what you can wish

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.750
for, and what may end up happening.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.760
For them, appearing as a Third Eye, is the
Imagined World.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.580
While living in the World of the Real, they
dream of things that never may happen, that

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.630
might actually happen, that may have actually
happened, they run circles in their mind with

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:25.190
these, that’s a special kind of joy, they
wouldn’t want to miss that…”

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.120
One more guy comes along.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.310
Ratnahasan.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:34.190
He says, “The world you live in is devoid
of emotions.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.870
There though, the Earthlings learn about Anger
by watching Fire.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.960
Peace and tranquility, they learn by watching
the Ocean.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.210
And, laughter by watching the flow of Water.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.550
So, he lives in a world suffused with Emotions.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.460
And, Emotions mark the passage of time.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.790
You were unhappy yesterday.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.460
Today, you are quite happy.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.130
In a short while, we will perhaps be eager
and enthusiastic.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:05.950
And, that is what actually defines the milestones
of time’s passing.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.370
Sorry, please don’t wait for her.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.920
She is not going to return!”

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.450
What does Suryahasan say?

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.550
“Amaiyaath Thulaamullena…

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.440
Like swinging wildly between the extremes
of a pendulum…

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.690
Between the Past and the Present and the Possible
Futures.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.490
Memories of what could have been, in the Past.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:32.660
Expectations of the infinite pathways of the
Future.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.400
And the fleeting moment of the Present.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:45.030
It is like a dissatisfied little needle, swinging
like a mad pendulum between these three Times.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:51.290
Inside each person’s mind, this is what
resides, you can’t replace this here, and

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:58.660
whoever has tasted it, would never want to
leave that and come over!”

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:07.350
And, finally, a Gandharva by name Jwaalaakshan
says, “You live in a world of infinite,

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.350
completed knowledge.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.350
Those guys?

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.910
They have this thing called Aridhal Enum Perinbam!

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:22.010
I didn’t know this yesterday, it sounded
so big, so confusing, I was completely outfoxed

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.130
by it…

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.660
Today, I got a way.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.980
Tomorrow, I may know it!

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.420
Aridhal Enum Perinbam…!

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.570
That joy that comes, that unique joy, when
you learn something new and interesting each

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:45.670
day, you have nothing of that sort in Devaloka,
sorry, she is not coming back!”

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.460
The seven Gandharvas thus end their report,
and Indra immediately realises, “Oh my God,

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.970
these guys make sense!

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.280
Of course all the things they said are valid
points..” and then, decides to try some

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.540
other ploy to eventually get Oorvashi back
to Heaven.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.400
Or, that is how the story goes!

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:11.450
So, probably living forever in that beautiful
heavenly world, is not for everybody…!

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.660
What do you think?

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.580
There is a website called Waitbutwhy!

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.040
In that website, there is this little picture
that makes you… take pause…!

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.220
Hey, do you think you are going to live to
90?

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.800
Well, if you picturise it, one dot per year,
this is what it is!

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.320
You start there, you die here!

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.930
This is what it is!

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.230
Mark, mark where you are!

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.960
Oh, years are too long?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.880
It takes too much time to pass us by?

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.470
Let us look at it then as probably months.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:57.330
If you are age, your life expectancy is 90,
you will probably live this many dots.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.330
Mark.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.520
Mark where you are!

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.750
Probably you are one-fourth in?

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.140
Two-thirds in?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.840
Wait.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.740
Even a month is too long.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.330
A day is too short.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.800
Why not we look at weeks?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.110
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:26.120
If I were to look at it as weeks, this is
what it would look like.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:33.600
Start up there on top, and 4000+ weeks later,
there you are!

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.840
Are you accounting for that time you are spending?

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.520
You can spend that only in two ways, he says!

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.420
Firstly, learn to enjoy that week!

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.520
Completely, to the hilt!

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:58.390
Or, a better approach would be, do something
meaningful, do something constructive, do

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.430
something that will help you lead the rest
of your weeks better!

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:11.530
Probably by helping others get better, or,
perhaps by strengthening your own basic fundamentals,…

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:17.730
Do something that will ensure the quality
of life you will lead from now on, for the

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:22.280
rest of the weeks, is better than it could
have been.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.360
Simple.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.620
Where are you?

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.620
Account for yourself.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.560
Let us take a look at three famous people…

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:36.510
Where was Rafael Nadal when he actually won
his first French Open?

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.410
19 years old!

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.940
That’s where he was!

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.570
Where was Isaac Newton?

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.760
When he started talking about the First Law
of Motion?!

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.440
He was 23.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:54.090
A covid-like pandemic had shut his college
down.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.630
He was sent home!

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.630
Lockdown!

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.630
What did he do in the lockdown?

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.860
He didn’t watch Netflix or play PUBG…

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.400
He actually brought out the First Law of Motion.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.530
Twenty-three years old.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.210
How old are you?!

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.210
Wait.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.210
Wait.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.210
Wait.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.210
No!

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.210
I am not mocking you!

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.610
I have one more person waiting!

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:22.700
This lady, famous artist, famous American
artist, a person popular for drawing rural

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:32.880
pastoral scenes so very well, she STARTED
painting at the age of 78.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.290
She didn’t become FAMOUS at 78!

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.880
She has STARTED painting at 78.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.330
And became famous AFTERWARDS.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:48.670
Grandma Moses, she was lovingly called.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.690
She STARTED at the age of 78.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:57.690
So, don’t worry where you are on this chart.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.250
All that matters is you gotta get started.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.420
In the right direction, doing the right thing.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.180
That’s my closing thought actually today.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:14.020
This person’s name is Chuck Palahniuk.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.240
Remember the Fight Club movie?

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.410
He was the guy who authored the book!

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.970
Look at what he says!

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.510
We all die!

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:39.740
The goal isn’t to live forever, the goal
is to create something that will.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.810
You are surely going to die.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.050
Today, tomorrow, some day.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:53.350
But, the stuff that you created, will it bring
fame to your name, live forever?

00:16:53.350 --> 00:17:02.980
That is 
the only challenge in front of you?!

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.980
Isn’t that cool?!

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.980
We’ll meet again, very soon, if we are around
alive till then!

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.649
Thank you!
