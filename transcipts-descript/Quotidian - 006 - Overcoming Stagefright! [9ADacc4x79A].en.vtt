00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:11.960
Hello there! Welcome to Quotidian!
I have just one more bit pending from this

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:27.570
movie. I will "move on" after that! He comes.
He crosses the ditch and walks past the big

00:00:27.570 --> 00:01:02.760
rock. He wants to try lifting it just one
more time. Again, there is the furtive glance

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.394
to ensure nobody is watching. Looks like he
is going to be able to lift it this time.

00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:19.412
He lifts it… Nobody is watching, till now.
The first spectator comes along… 

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:34.602
What happened? Why did he panic and throw it away, just when
he was in the brink of victory?&nbsp;

00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:39.651
Fear of the stage. That was what it was. They
call it "Stagefright". I am sure we all have

00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:45.410
experienced that. The precocious child wonder
who sings so well at home, along comes a visitor,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.795
and we beseech the child to demonstrate their
skill, and&nbsp;… "nothing comes out"! For some

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:58.054
of us, the problem is too real. A microphone
in front of us actually makes it seem like

00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:02.352
we are staring down the cold lethal barrel
of a gun.&nbsp;

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:07.235
The symptoms are quite classic too. Choking!
Fainting! Elevated heartbeat rate! Mortal

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:14.245
fear! Shivering, wobbling at your knees, sweating,
and a sensation as if you are about to throw

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:21.297
up! They call it the "Anxiety Attack"! They
call it "Stage Fright"! But, wait, this is

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:28.600
not new! This dates back to Greek times! When
you present to a large crowd, when you want

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.277
to persuade, when you want to deliver an oration,
you shiver, and you wonder, "What will other

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:44.350
people think"! There is this cute little Greek
practice - if there is something that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.320
happens often enough, and is prevalent enough
popularly, they end up giving a word for it.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.310
Allodoxaphobia. That's what they called it.
"allo" stands for "different", "doxa" stands

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.260
for "opinion", and of course, "phobia" is
"fear". So, a word, right there, for the fear

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.400
of what different opinions other people might
have. A fear of what other people might think.&nbsp;

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.620
There are many "antidotes" for this. Many
techniques. Books have been penned. Video

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.140
courses exist. There are clubs. Speaking clubs,
presenting clubs, mastering the art of public

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:32.630
speaking,&nbsp;… Don't focus on any body, they
would say. Don't lock your eyes on to anybody.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.510
Just look "generically". Some would suggest,
"focus on some little dot way back in the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.420
last row, on the wall". Another suggestion
would be "Prepare well, practice, practice,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.350
practice". And of course, a natural at this
art would say, "None of the above works. Just

00:03:50.350 --> 00:04:02.300
go ex tempore. Ad lib. Let it flow". My dad
used to tell me "Assume everybody in front

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:18.930
of you are sheep. You are the expert. The
rest of them are just herds of sheep. It will

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:29.390
automatically flow"! There is a documented
technique of inserting rounded stones into

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.639
your mouth and practising singing or speaking!
Demosthenes, a famous Greek philosopher and

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:50.350
orator, a king too, he had this unusual habit
of competing with the breaking waves in the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.000
seashore, trying to keep his focus and present
his thoughts against the loud noise made by

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.790
the sea.&nbsp;
My favorite trick though, is this.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:14.000
Olin Miller once said "You probably wouldn't
worry about what people think of you, if you

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.910
could know how seldom they do".
You won't be worried what they would be mocking

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:29.180
you with, what criticism they would be levelling,
if only you knew that when you were delivering

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.921
your speech, most of them were looking at
their watch wondering when the lunch break

00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:39.130
would be, most of them were looking at their
watch planning their sprint to the taxi stand

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:47.990
to avoid the last minute rush, they simply
don't CARE about you! Please understand that

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.180
first!
The irony of it all? I went searching, who

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.240
this Olin Miller is… Such a nice quote.
Who was he? Shall we use a photo of this person

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.290
when posting this quote? In the great internet,
I couldn't (easily) find a single photograph

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.990
of who this Olin Miller is, nobody knows who
he is, nobody knows when he was born, nothing!

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.440
Olin Miller spake thus! That's all we know!
Olin Miller himself is proof for the maxim

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:23.205
that he contributed to this world "Nobody
really bothers enough or has time enough to think about you!"
