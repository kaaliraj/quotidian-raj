00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.480
Namaste!

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.930
You may have played this game already.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.630
The Mummy Maze was the name of the game.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.470
A dead and dried up, bandage-clad Egyptian
Mummy, and you are exploring through a maze

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.020
inside a pyramid, and it is chasing you through
the labyrinth.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.599
What is special about this though is — this
mummy is quite strong!

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.320
If you take one step forward, it will take
TWO STEPS forward!

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.420
But…, it is a bit low on IQ.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.370
And so, its movements will always be TOWARDS
YOU.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.079
As a result, if I am the mummy, and I get
caught in a tricky situation, am blocked by

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.110
a wall, and to continue the chase, if I have
to move around the wall, and in doing so if

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.899
I am going to temporarily go FARTHER AWAY
FROM YOU, I won’t move!

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:51.899
Watch this!

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.899
Did you see that?

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:02.769
It could have caught the human, but it is
not!

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.240
It is not moving, because moving will render
it temporarily farther from the end goal of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.240
capturing the human!

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.500
I can CATCH you if only I have the additional
wisdom of “going around a temporary obstacle”,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.310
but I won’t suffer temporary discomfort
because I lack the brains for it!

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.340
A foolish mummy!

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.820
What is the lesson there?

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.390
There is a little lesson!

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.390
Observe!

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.000
My dad used to run a typewriting institute.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.930
For a very long time, before computers became
famous.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.930
Typewriting..

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.930
Lower.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.930
I have passed “lower” in typing.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.930
I have passed “higher” in typing…

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080
ASDF… remember all those phrases from that
era?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.330
He was running a typewriting training institute.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.920
He used to take students in batches for the
exam.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.280
And, one advice he would give to all the students,
just before they got into the examination

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
hall?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.350
Would actually seem counter-intuitive.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.960
This is what he said: When the bell rings,
when they announce to everybody that they

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.390
can start taking the test, don’t immediately
start thrashing away at the keyboard!

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.670
Relax.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.760
Take pause.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.790
Plan.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.110
Then, slowly, gently get into the game, get
into the rhythm.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.180
He would say.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.590
Interesting piece of advice.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.430
If you consider the Rubik’s Cube… you
can even ask some of the best experts..

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:37.749
they would all agree, that it is impossible
to keep solving the Cube and finally reach

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:43.129
the final, all-perfect-colored-faces without
temporary destruction.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.489
I have brought it to a level of perfection
— perhaps one face at the top, or a plus

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.790
/ cross mark on each face, some form of structure
and organisation…

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.519
From this, to reach the end goal (just like
the Mummy did), without damaging this current

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.159
structure in any way, may not even be possible.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.519
All Cube-solvers will agree.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.410
It’s probably impossible.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.499
If you want to shoot forward, you have to
pull back first.

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:21.629
If you are going to be adamant, saying, “I
won’t pull back, I will only shoot forward”,

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.769
your arrow won’t go far enough!

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.420
You need to plan for some slack.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.709
You have to pull back.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.019
You need space for your elbow to go backwards.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:38.610
You are shooting forward anyway, so, why pull
back? — is NOT the logic that applies here.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.740
In America, in the wild Americas, the ram,
the one with the battering skull, … see

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.579
what happens when those two rams come together.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.700
The battering rams.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.370
The older ram seems to walk away in submission.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.590
But this posture is known as the Low Stretch.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.799
It means, you want a piece of me?

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:21.020
Come and get it!

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:30.270
It retreats a couple of steps!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.710
Not out of fear.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.140
It is planning.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.870
It is taking two steps backwards so that it
can shoot four steps forward.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.280
If you are going to resolve to never take
a step back, your punching-forward-force may

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.100
even be less than optimal!

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.610
This is the style and strategy of the battering
ram from the Americas!

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.410
But, Thiruvalluvar seems to have known about
it!

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.080
In Kural 486, he has said, “Ookkam udaiyaan
odukkam, poruthagar thaakkarkup perun thagaitthu”.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.520
If an enthusiastic, energetic, wise person
delays their activity for some reason, without

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.580
immediately diving in and getting started,
it could perhaps be because they are planning

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:29.450
and taking pause, just as the battering ram
takes a few steps back before ramming forward!

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.450
It is adjusting.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.450
Strategising.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.450
Planning.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.710
They are not running away in fear!

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.160
They are planning better!

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.640
So, the message I take away, from these four
/ five little tidbits I have given is, it

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.040
is probably not always forward.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.340
Sometimes sideways!

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.600
Sometimes may even be backwards.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.820
Sometimes, it might mean temporary destruction.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.890
It might even seem counterintuitive to undo
all the progress made till then.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:19.330
But… that temporary constructive destruction
may be needed to pave the path for something

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.820
even better.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.310
Thank you!
