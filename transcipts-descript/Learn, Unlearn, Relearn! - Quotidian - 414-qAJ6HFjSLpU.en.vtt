00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.520
Alvin Toffler.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.100
We have encountered this man earlier too.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.309
1970, FIFTY YEARS ago, he had predicted already!

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:27.560
The illiterate of the 21st century will not

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:48.280
be those who cannot read and write, but those
who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:59.519
How beautiful!

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.130
Namaste!

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.530
Four hundred and fourteen!

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.450
Learn, Unlearn, Relearn!

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:18.320
Only when I was looking for a suitable Tamil
translation did it suddenly occur to me that&nbsp;..

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.760
"Hey, that thing Learn is படி, and then
there is a மறுபடி, which is..

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.280
மறுபடி, திருப்பி,
மறு..

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:41.490
படி, but if you look at மறு independently,
hey, that is what is Unlearning!

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.150
மறு… to reject whatever knowledge
you thought you had acquired.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.050
Something that you had thought to be right,&nbsp;…
you tell yourself, hey, unload that junk,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.680
it is no longer worth it!

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.100
So, படி, மறு, மறுபடி!

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.510
Did you like it?

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.140
Alright, let us dive right in!

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.140
Dots!

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.219
We discussed them in the previous episode
too.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.629
It is all about Collecting the dots, we concluded!

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.400
Connecting comes after Collecting, Emerging
comes after Connecting, and finally, we have

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400
Sharing.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400
But…

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400
do you realise?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400
It becomes one eternal, endless cycle?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.900
We collect a lot of Dots.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.480
We could call that a Learning phase, perhaps.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.060
And then, we strive to Learn even more.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.459
And for that, we try to Connect them all up.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.709
Oh, this one and that one, there is a connection.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.969
This happens because of that.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:44.969
This happens along with that.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.969
This happens for that.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:46.969
And so on.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.670
We try making a lot of Connections.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.129
That is the Learning phase.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.719
But, along the way, life is not such a beautiful
honeymoon.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.689
Along the way, you also get into this..

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.909
A beginner-level learner, what does he say?

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.510
Oh my God, I haven't learned everything there
is to, in this..

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.939
The circle is still unfilled!

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.659
Oh my, I have acquired this, but looks like
this is toxic, troublesome.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:17.659
Bad knowledge!

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:18.790
This is irrelevant.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.079
This is useless.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.599
And, Oh, there is a connection that is supposed
to exist between this and that, but it is

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.599
currently missing!

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.599
These..

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.290
these happen in the Unlearning phase.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.920
Only after that, we realise what is important,
what is needed in more quantity, what is to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.670
be explored broadly, and what deeply, that
is when you enter the Relearning phase.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.499
So, Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn.

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:57.400
If we were to take a simple example, Mathematics…

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.650
Primitive Man, when he realised that he had
countable fingers in his hand, he started

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.290
keeping track of animals.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:15.620
And, one of the things he told himself was,
"If you have some, and I have some, and we

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.650
bring them together, we will have more!"

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.750
A fundamental truth of Mathematics, he thought.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.020
A number and another number, both of which
could be represented by fingers, when put

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.900
together, will actually yield a higher number..

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.280
But, did we stop fiddling with it??

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280
Did we?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.120
This is what we ended up doing!

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.010
We created a number called Zero!

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.210
Where do we go to represent it?

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.910
Which finger would that be?

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.580
So, whatever we were thinking till now, "A
number and another number, will always yield

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.280
a larger number in addition?"

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.580
Sorry, wrong, that assumption has been proved
baseless!

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.560
Then we entered the world of minuses, negative
numbers.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:11.780
Then we drilled down to fractions, half, quarter,
all the way down to irrational numbers, repeatable,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.330
non-repeatable,&nbsp;… all the way to Pi!

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:24.750
So, we had to Unlearn a lot of the fundamentals
that we thought were etched in stone.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.910
So many things that we thought as unbreakable
rules and unfalsifiable truths…?

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.950
We had to tell ourselves, "Sorry, no, I don't
have to believe that as the truth any longer"!

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.910
But, you know what happened in that cycle?

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.190
We Learned. and then, we had to Unlearn.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.080
But you know where the last phase of Learning
happened?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.360
It happened when we realised that numbers
were actually points on a plane!

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.970
There is an axis called the Imaginary Axis.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.950
There is a Real Axis.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.950
And, in that plane, if we were to throw a
stone and see it land, and if we had to represent

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.460
the location of the stone accurately, those
are numbers!

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.860
And, hence, there are infinite numbers.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.620
And, every position can be uniquely represented!

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:23.900
And, when we get that sort of knowledge, that
level of abstraction, that is when we realise:

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:31.000
what we Learned was true, what we Unlearned
was important, and what we have now Relearned,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.830
subsumes what we Learned and what we Unlearned.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.140
It puts them all together in a simpler package
for us.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.820
Only now, all the Dots are Connected completely!

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.630
When you Learn, you actually learn it from
a Guru.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.810
You don't know it.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.980
You go to somebody who knows it.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.150
They even call it the Guru Effect.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.211
You have to be wary of the Guru Effect.

00:06:57.211 --> 00:07:04.660
It is the tendency for people to "judge as
profound, what they have failed to grasp"!

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.750
It is called the Guru Effect.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.210
You have to be careful about that.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:16.320
But, in this phase, you actually approach
a Guru, a Mentor, a person who has already

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:23.210
been there and done that, and import, download,
knowledge from them.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.950
You Learn.&nbsp;

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.980
The second phase is Unlearn.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:36.910
That's when you meet a lot of mentors and
you realise, "Hey, both of them can't be true!

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.520
Dr. Einstein says something.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.480
The Sadguru says something else.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.430
How can both coexist?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.849
There is friction when they come together.

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:52.420
How can both of these be right about the way
the universe works?"

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:59.030
That is when you Collect, that is when you
sort things out, you sift through the accumulated

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.970
content, and then you realise, "This little
bit that this guy said is right, while the

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:08.400
other bit the other guy spoke of is right
too, and these two can coexist in this universe!"

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.740
You create YOUR version!

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.610
That is the Unlearning phase.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.700
And, who is the Guru during this Unlearning
phase?

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.600
Well, YOU are!

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.300
You teach yourself your version of how the
world operates around you.&nbsp;

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.330
And then comes the third phase.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.300
In the first phase, you Learn from your Guru.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.180
In the second phase, you are your own Guru.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.789
They call him a Swayamaaccharya.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:48.080
I dictate to myself what is right based on
all the probably conflicting things I have

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.930
heard around in my world, and create something
that will not give me sleepless nights.&nbsp;

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.680
What is the third phase?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.930
Learn.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.180
Unlearn.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.080
The third phase is Relearn.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.480
While Relearning, who is your Guru?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.019
The people you meet.

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:10.300
The co-learners.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.019
The Gurus are quite a small number.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:15.620
But, interested adults are way too many.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.370
And, after the first two phases, you are ready
to fill in the gaps.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:26.499
You are ready to take in other conflicting
opinions people have built.

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:29.240
Like you, they must have done the first two
phases too!

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.480
You go in search of people who have aced the
first two phases, find them, and share your

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.649
version.

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.110
And they will share theirs.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.290
It is OK to have conflict!

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.020
In the second phase, we were wondering how
to resolve conflict!

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.069
In the first phase, there is really no place
for conflict!

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:50.290
You are just learning the one right way to
do something.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:55.329
But in the third phase, conflicts can happily
coexist, you are told!

00:09:55.329 --> 00:10:01.040
In the third phase, what is the warning for
us?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.449
What is that something to be careful about?

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:11.720
However diverse a cross-section of people
you can meet, men, women, whites, blacks,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.029
rich people, poor people, all kinds of people,
the better for you.

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:19.290
They have to be there in that mix of versions
that you collect.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:28.589
Only when you collect conflicting and not-easily-indigestible
versions, your Relearning phase begins, and

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:33.230
gets you ready for the Big Bad World!&nbsp;

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:40.930
We have seen the Golden Circle of Simon Sinek.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.579
Hope you remember it!

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:46.269
What do we do in the Learn phase?

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:47.620
We learn WHAT it is.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.620
What is this?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.620
Division?

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.620
Long form division?

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.620
Organic Chemistry?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.639
Finding out of a square root?

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.421
Something or the other.

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:55.980
We understand WHAT it is.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.920
That, by itself, is a tall order.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.600
So, it takes time.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:07.449
In this phase, we are told to do it in one
manner, and we just do it in that manner.&nbsp;

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:13.250
Only in the Unlearning phase, we understand
the HOW a bit more.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.819
We have been told to do it this way.

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:19.370
But there are other ways to do the same thing.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.079
We realise that all of these can coexist!

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:27.009
So, in Mathematics, for example, you may have
approached quite a lot of problems algebraically.

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:33.149
When you get to the higher classes, you realise
that there is a geometric solution to this,

00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:34.750
which is a lot more elegant.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.839
Multiple pathways, leading to the same answer!

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:41.470
Why, let us consider religion!

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:48.670
We had been thinking all along that there
is but one God.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.589
Just one religion.

00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:57.949
But, when we encounter other religions and
the beauties that exist in them, that is where

00:11:57.949 --> 00:12:01.829
we realise that the HOWs can be many.

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:04.319
That is the Unlearning phase.

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:09.240
And then, the final phase, is when we learn
the WHY.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.339
Why do we do Mathematics?

00:12:12.339 --> 00:12:14.829
What's up with Religion?

00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:19.009
Why are we on the quest for a God?

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:20.009
The WHY!

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:21.459
Simon had already proposed that we should
start with WHY.

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:27.680
But, for that WHY to percolate inside and
have a clear impact, we must have Learned,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.350
and we must have Unlearned.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.540
That is when we are ready for our personal
WHY.&nbsp;

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:42.899
Looking at the trio once again, we can see
them as a timeline too.

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:45.990
What do you Learn?

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.259
You learn about the past.

00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:50.999
We learn about some random guy having fought
a war and won.

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:56.290
We learn about another random guy having sat
under a tree and achieved enlightenment.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.220
We learn about somebody who has mixed one
chemical element with another chemical element

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.949
and created a new compound.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:03.949
We learn history.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:06.269
We learn from the past.&nbsp;

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:12.699
Where do you think is the Unlearning happening?

00:13:12.699 --> 00:13:14.120
Right now!

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.120
Right now!

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.870
As you are watching this video, the Unlearning
is happening.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:25.000
You are breaking down some of the things that
don't really work with your mindset, you are

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.660
making new connections, and you are basically
realising, "What got me here won't get me

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.660
there!"

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.910
A colleague of mine told this to me very beautifully,
recently.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:48.130
She said, the first iota of enlightenment
a butterfly gets is the lesson that all the

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:56.839
lessons that the butterfly had learned as
a caterpillar are no longer relevant, and

00:13:56.839 --> 00:13:58.600
that it needs to relearn.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.009
It needs to unlearn and it needs to relearn.

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:08.279
That is the first revelation it gets when
it spreads its wings for the first time.

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:12.840
Otherwise, it will be crawling around on a
branch.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.749
Only because it has that revelation, it is
able to fly away.

00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:21.660
What got you here, won't get you there.&nbsp;

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.740
So, that was the Past, Learning..

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.740
And the Present.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.120
Which is Unlearning.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.529
The Future, is about your Relearning.

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:32.660
What does that mean?

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.660
Relearn in the Future?

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.800
Well, while learning a subject, we think it
is simplistic.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800
The Moon.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.730
We are told it is a silver plate up in the
sky.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.899
Wrong, but it is Simplistic.

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:52.920
The mother is able to teach it to the young
child, and the child believes it.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:15:01.350
But as your learning grows, as you understand
about planets and solar systems, gravity,

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.899
you actually realise that you have to Unlearn
a lot of grandma stories.

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:11.329
And, you realise you actually know LESSER
about something now.

00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:12.802
I don't know what the Moon is.

00:15:12.802 --> 00:15:13.802
I thought it was a silver plate.

00:15:13.802 --> 00:15:16.699
I don't know if it is a large rock.

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:20.440
I have to go, check it out.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:25.240
And that is when complications and complexity
bother your mind.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.670
You are at your lowest.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:35.800
But, from that simplistic world, after Learning
all that junk, you learn the complications

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:44.509
world, where you have to probably Unlearn,
and that takes you, if you are AT IT, if you

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:51.300
try hard enough long enough, you get to the
simple world.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.649
Simple is different from Simplistic.

00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:55.699
What is Simple?

00:15:55.699 --> 00:16:09.640
That the Apple that falls when ripe, off the
tree and to the ground, is acted upon by the

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.019
same force that pulls the beautiful moon every
night to spin around the Earth!

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:15.019
Gravity!

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:16.589
G M1 M2 divided by R Squared!

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:17.589
Newton!

00:16:17.589 --> 00:16:20.319
That is the elegant simplicity we all want.

00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:30.060
But, we have to Learn, Unlearn, and have the
space into which the Relearning can happen.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.749
We often hear the cliches.

00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:33.749
Ask advice from the elders.

00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:35.220
Follow the advice you get from elders.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220
etc.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.930
We tell our elders "I will follow what you
say!".

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.699
But, why do we do that?

00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:44.629
This is my Dad.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.679
As a young Air Force officer.

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:49.769
He hadn't even married by that time.

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:52.879
And then, he got married.

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:55.990
And then he got old.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.399
He lived past the age of 80.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:00.420
He has had experiences.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.689
I have followed his advice.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.059
Quite a lot!

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:09.360
In fact, whenever I strayed off the beaten
path, disobeying his advice, I have been beaten

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.299
up badly by Life!

00:17:11.299 --> 00:17:13.789
Why do we seek the advice of elders?!

00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:15.990
I saw a beautiful quote!

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.990
Why?

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.600
Is it to learn from them?

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.670
To Learn and then realise that they are wrong
and Unlearn?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:34.299
And then, having Unlearned, reject their advice
from now on and Relearn by ourselves?

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:35.380
No!

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:42.929
We don't seek the advice of elders because
they are always right!

00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:49.900
We seek their advice specifically because
they have more experience being wrong!

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.100
They have stumbled many times!

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.000
They don't want you to stumble the same way
unnecessarily!

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.200
You need to stumble too, but in other, new,
potentially useful ways!

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.960
You need time for that!

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:10.250
It is an opportunity for you to live in a
day, the life he has lived in eighty years.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.630
He gives you that bit of advice.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.149
All the mistakes.

00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:15.820
All the failings.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.820
All the shortcomings.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.159
Take it… if you want.

00:18:18.159 --> 00:18:21.279
Else, suffer and struggle through it like
a fool.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:25.799
That is why we go to the Elders!

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:28.370
Closing thought on this Dots concept.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.309
We saw Alvin Toffler earlier, didn't we?

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:34.070
We saw a quotation by him.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.320
Shall we google for it?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.269
This is the only quote that comes up in that
context.

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:42.620
Learn, Unlearn, Relearn!

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.320
Okay, I have that very book!

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.799
I have an electronic library!

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:47.820
Shall we go to that library, I thought!

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.950
Shall we see the very page where he talks
about it?

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:51.950
I did.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:52.950
And surprise!

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.950
ZERO results!

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.899
You know what the original quote is?

00:18:55.899 --> 00:18:57.730
It was really shocking!

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.549
The original quote goes like this!

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:08.750
"Tomorrow's illiterate will not be the man
who can't read or write; he will be the man

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.679
who has not learned how to learn!"

00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:23.250
So, Learn, Unlearn, Relearn, are compressed
together into a quintessential phrase.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.840
Learning how to Learn.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:33.300
If you focus on that alone, even if you learn
ONLY THAT, you don't need a school, you don't

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.130
need a college, you don't need a teacher!

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:44.029
Wherever you go, whoever you meet, whatever
you see, will be, at that moment, the best

00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:47.220
teacher you could have had!

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.250
All the best!

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:55.909
We will meet you soon!

00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:58.409
Thank you!
