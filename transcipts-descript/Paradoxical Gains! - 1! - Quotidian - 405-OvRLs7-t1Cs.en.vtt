00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.800
In the year 2020.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.419
CEOs of THESE companies…

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:16.860
Each of them very famous, world-famous, famous
for its longevity, famous for its innovation,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.910
.. CEOs working in these organisations, in
2020…

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.029
We keep prating on about The Great Resignation
and so on…

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.440
That “Employees are leaving”..

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.600
But, the CEOs of these famous, popular, great
companies, quit in the year 2020.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
Every one of them.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:53.210
What do you think the reason was?!

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.460
Namaste!

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.700
Paradoxical..

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:12.710
Yes, a gain, but a paradoxical cause for it..?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.759
An interesting question is raised right there.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.759
We saw those CEOs who quit those companies.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:29.259
But, if you roll back to… not just 2020,
but 2000 itself…

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.359
look at the past 20 years..

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.479
What were ALL THE challenges people faced,
while helming companies..?

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.780
It started with the Y2K bug, some of you might
be too young to know what it was..

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.659
It was probably more threatening and more
dangerous-looking than even the real bug that

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.880
hit us in 2019/2020.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.200
And, in between?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.270
What disasters visited us?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.170
There was this dot-com bubble burst.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.380
Then, the September 11 tragedy.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.710
It wasn’t something that damaged just two
buildings in America.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.490
It had a telling effect on the global economy
itself.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.650
Then the housing bubble burst.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.860
Each one of them was a black swan.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.660
Completely unexpected, changing everything
from now on.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.959
What will our CEOs do??

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.379
They want to continue doing the same approaches..

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.970
And they want to solve the problems that they
have never seen before.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.629
Isn’t that gonna be hard?!

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.709
In Quotidian 298, while talking about The
Zen of Python, we talked about complexity

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:49.709
and complicatedness.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.390
And, according to The Zen of Python, Simple
is better than Complex, and Complex is better

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.180
than Complicated.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.640
And, there is a reasoning for that.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.189
In the programming language environment, yes,
Simple, Complex, Complicated!

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.940
But, I was reading a book recently.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.120
Called The Eight Paradoxes of Great Leadership.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.390
And, in that book, the author differentiates
between Complicated and Complex thus.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.280
And, warns us that Complicated is fine, but
Complex, you don’t want to be there, he

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.280
commiserates!

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.950
So, what is the difference?

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.400
What example did the author use?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.010
Well, they talk about this scenario.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.299
Take a simple Math problem.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.549
Well, not simple, but slightly Complicated.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.170
A math problem.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.340
There are six rectangles.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.390
What is the perimeter of this shape, if each
rectangle has a perimeter of 222!?

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.830
There seems to be some information missing!

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.950
No additional data is given!

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.950
You wonder…

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.049
Oh my, how are we going to solve this problem?!

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.189
Please try it.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.950
I will wait!

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.830
But, the point is, if a Maths student sees
this problem, and unable to solve it, goes

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:19.590
to sleep, when they wake up and look at the
problem again, it is going to be looking exactly

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.030
the same, calmly waiting for him or her, to
try that problem again.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.960
Yes, it is Complicated, but it is not threatening
him more!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.020
On the other hand, what would be Complex?

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.930
He gives this example.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:49.039
Look at the Air Traffic Control scene.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.610
Up there, in the high tower, in the airport,
with hundreds of aircraft taking off and landing

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.380
all the time, where a single mistake could
cause humongous damage, in such a Complex

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.380
scenario…

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.900
If the person, not knowing how to handle it,
goes to sleep for half an hour, what would

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.900
happen?!?!

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.530
Will the problem remain the same?!

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.770
It changes while you are working on it.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.300
That is a Complex problem.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:25.560
And, today’s management problems, problems
faced by each manager, each leader, each CEO,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.479
is a Complex problem, says this author.

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.650
When people join a team, these days, what
do they come loaded with?

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.360
Why is managing a group of people, why is
being a leader today, much harder than it

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.620
was once?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.349
Well, the author gives five reasons why.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.259
Reason Number One — More “Formal Education”.

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.139
Once upon a time it was one degree, and then,
it was work.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.259
That’s where you learn.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.699
Today, the “lust for degrees” seems to
have increased a bit.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:10.879
Higher Education, Education Abroad, more letters
after my name, … so, these days, managers

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:17.440
end up managing people who are more educated
“formally”, than them.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.540
These guys are more experienced.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.540
More worldly-wise.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.900
But, … some couple of degrees from some
random college in her kitty, she arrives,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.720
and it becomes Complex when we try to manage
Her!

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.590
Reason Number Two — More “Entitlement”.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.971
I am the king.

00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:39.410
I am the one who deserves it.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.960
I need it.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.039
I need it NOW.

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.110
I am the first.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.110
Because?

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.110
Because!

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.680
I am entitled for it.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.110
Nobody is as good as I am.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.100
I should be chosen first…

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.300
Well, I don’t know where it starts…

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.560
Probably it starts with the One Kid Syndrome,
while parenting?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.470
Probably it starts in the highly competitive
environment in schools…

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:13.599
but, when somebody enters an organisation
for work, … too often, we notice they come

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.290
with a sense of entitlement.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.990
I am entitled.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.280
I deserve this.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.650
I deserve a lot more.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.229
Don’t think you are doing me a favour!

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:23.940
I deserve this.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.420
How do we manage these people?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.740
How do we lead these people?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.740
Complex!

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.060
Reason Number Three — More “Exposure”.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.990
They come with a lot more exposure.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.259
They are not happy about it either.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.409
Watch The Social Dilemma on Netflix, and you
will understand!

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:38.409
They are not happy!

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:41.460
They are caught in a web.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.440
They have to be transparent about whatever
they do.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440
Because?

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440
Peer pressure.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440
Everybody is doing it.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.199
They’re having such fun!

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:53.830
Let me also POSE as if I am having fun!

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.560
They come with a lot more exposure!

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.360
And, with this exposure, there is a double-edged
sword.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.340
A second, dark side to this.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:08.039
In those olden days, when we referred to Mahatma
Gandhi, we all saw him as a one-dimensional

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:14.930
Father of 
the Nation.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.930
Mahatma.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.930
What mistakes did he do?

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.330
What were his thoughts, day to day?

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.199
Nobody documented those, and hence, those
were lost.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.030
Only the good things survived.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:29.000
Today, are we thinking along the same lines
about Elon Musk??

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.610
Just when we look at him as a true visionary…
he tweets about something insignificant, and

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.700
we wonder… who the hell is this person actually?!

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.040
So, a cynicism sets in.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.880
Is this what the world is actually about,
after all?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.950
A bitterness…

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.220
How do we manage these people?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.170
How do we lead these people?

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.170
Complex!

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.690
Reason Number Four — More “Emotion”.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:02.360
Once upon a time, we were taught to keep them
in check.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.740
Keep them in control.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.890
Be a professional, they said.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.260
Hold your emotions in check — that’s how
they taught us.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.860
But, today, give vent to your emotions.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.410
That’s what Twitter is for.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.690
That’s what Facebook is for!

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.820
Somebody is (always!) wrong on the Internet!

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.010
That is what each person seems to think, today!

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.470
Today, people celebrate the venting of emotions…

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:31.120
This movie, “Inside Out”, from Pixar.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.510
I don’t think it would have made sense ten
or fifteen years ago.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:41.300
It was such a hit when it came out a few years
ago, because, people related to it.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.550
People related to the venting of emotions.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:51.959
And, today, when people vent their emotions
at the “drop of a hat”, so easily, how

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.570
do we manage these people?

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.620
How do we lead these people?

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.880
It is going to be Complex!

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.029
Reason Number Five — More “Expectation”.

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.920
And, finally, expectation.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.500
That is the fifth problem.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.230
They come superloaded with Expectations.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.920
Expectations on themselves.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.610
Expectations the world places on them.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.500
Look at this guy.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.500
Virat Kohli.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.010
No, it doesn’t mean 123 not out!

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.800
It is 123 innings without a hundred.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:37.120
Fans had mocked him thus, that he had a century
now… a century-plus streak of century-less

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.120
innings.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.310
You know how he began though?

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.740
He started like this!

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:49.370
The first 709 innings that he played in world-cricket,
he hammered 86 centuries!

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.620
No less!

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.130
What happened after that?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.130
Pressure.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.130
Peer pressure.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:11:02.600
Pressure from the huge cheering crowd that
greets him in every stadium he goes to play.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.820
Started affecting his game.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.860
That expectation.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.460
They come loaded with it.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.790
How do we manage these people?

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.660
How do we lead these people?

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.079
Complex!

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.279
That is what this book talks about.

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:18.540
It talks in paradoxes.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.540
Unsolvable riddles.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.540
Inexplicable complications.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.740
How can this be true while the other is true,
you ask yourself.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:31.540
It seems counter-intuitive, you tell yourself.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:37.769
Let us look at two of them today.

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:50.470
The first paradox that he talks about is the
balance between Confidence and Humility.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.470
Confidence is the feeling of invincibility.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.440
That you can face anything, and win everything!

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.570
You could even call it ego!

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.180
That extreme faith in self.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.180
Humility?

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.680
Well, I am not a big deal.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.529
There are much greater people than me.

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:03.260
I am just an insignificant contributor in
a corner.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.260
That is humility.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.839
Both are needed, if you are going to a leader,
today.

00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:13.250
They have to play the balancing game, between
these two.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.140
I would like to take a cricketing example.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.960
Do you remember this guy?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.510
Sir Vivian Richards.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.240
Captain of the West Indies team once.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.149
He was the original Master Blaster!

00:12:27.149 --> 00:12:32.660
Even today, he is featured without fail in
every “Greatest of all time” list compiled

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.910
anywhere by anybody.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.019
He was a cricketing STORM.

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:43.250
In tests, in one-days, unfortunately, he never
had the opportunity to play a T20 cricket

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.250
match.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.280
He would have lacerated the opposition, had
he had the opportunity.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.089
The confidence he had!

00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:52.089
The swagger!

00:12:52.089 --> 00:12:53.089
The walk!

00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:54.089
The intensity!

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:55.089
The slightly bloodshot eyes!

00:12:55.089 --> 00:12:59.060
The pearls of sweat on his forehead!

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:15.830
If he comes and takes position, it would be
as if he is challenging, “Ok, I have come,

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.020
What can you do, Come and get me!

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.060
If you can!”

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.480
That is how the opposition would feel.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.019
If you read about him in Quora, you would
see responses like “Others just played cricket,

00:13:27.019 --> 00:13:30.320
this guy destroyed the opposition bowling”..

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.529
“Bowlers shit in their pants”..

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:35.460
Really too good!

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:41.570
And, much of that play-making came from his
confidence.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.899
His faith in himself.

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:44.880
And not just that.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:54.259
He went beyond doing it for himself, and started
thinking he is doing it for the black community

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:55.259
at large.

00:13:55.259 --> 00:13:57.980
I am a black cricketer.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.430
And, I am playing for black upliftment.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.050
For, there were no other black cricketers
in any other country!

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:16.149
That confidence on the field,… and along
with it, humility, off the field.

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:17.149
Why?

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:18.970
He can afford to be humble.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:25.610
Respectful, peaceful, calm, polite, … my
business is in the 22 yard space.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.390
And, who is the king there?

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.390
Me!

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.769
Why should I bother whatever you do, out here?

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:35.540
I am not going to care!

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.089
It is like a dog barking at the grand sun!

00:14:40.089 --> 00:14:41.380
No big deal!

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.930
That was his attitude.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.800
And, that is great leadership!

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:54.480
The second paradoxical balance that the author
talks about for a leader, is the balance between

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.310
Vision and Blind Spots.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:06.540
Vision that is like the narrow focus of the
legendary Arjuna of Mahabharatha.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.540
Very clear.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.759
I know the goal.

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:13.160
And, what are blind-spots?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.300
I am choosing to ignore all the other negative
messages that are coming towards me.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.990
If I set my focus on doing something, I am
going to ignore messages that tell me it is

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.050
impossible, messages that tell me it is not
probably worth attempting, messages that tell

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.149
me that it is very hard to attempt.

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:35.579
I am going to turn a deaf ear, a blind eye,
towards those.

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:38.089
For that too, I want to give a cricketing
example.

00:15:38.089 --> 00:15:39.170
Featuring Virat Kohli.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.050
Please don’t be angry I denigrated him earlier.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.860
He has done this too!!

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.540
In 28 Feb 2012, he played this amazing match!

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:57.800
Sri Lanka had set an almost record-score of
320 to hit in 50 overs, but it won’t be

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:05.980
enough even if done in 50 because India had
to hit it in probably 40 overs, only then

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:16.019
the Net Run Rate would be high enough for
India to go on to the next round.

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:21.019
In that situation, … 320 not to be chased
in 50 overs, which itself is very difficult,

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:24.680
320 to be chased in 40 overs…

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.110
Sehwag and Sachin, already out, with not much.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:37.160
This person, he hit 133 in 86 balls!

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.760
And won the match for us!

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.350
They ask him later, in the post-match interview!

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.350
Blind Spots!!

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.350
What blind spots?

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.350
We will know now!

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.759
They ask him in the interview, how did you
do this?

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:52.639
And he says, “Oh well, Suresh Raina and
I were talking about this…

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:55.380
We need to look at this not as a one-day match.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.390
We should look at it as two T20 innings one
after the other!

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.339
160 in 20 overs is NOTHING in a T20 match.

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:08.380
That would mean, 320 in 40 overs should be
a cakewalk too!”

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.720
You know what happened?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.300
They finished it in 36.4 overs.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.770
That is the power of blindspots.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:19.330
I am not ready for a closing thought yet.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.770
We are going to see SIX more paradoxes.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.910
They are up tomorrow itself!

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.130
Till we meet again, thank you!
