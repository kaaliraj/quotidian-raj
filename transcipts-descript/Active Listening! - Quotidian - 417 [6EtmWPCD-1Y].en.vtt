00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.690
We all have that friend, don’t we..? We
will be talking to him. For a long while..

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.430
And then, something, suddenly will occur to
us.. Is he even listening to me?! We would

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.080
ask them. Hey, were you even listening? And
then, they will immediately adopt the strategy

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.560
of repeating the last-heard sentences and
try to prove that they indeed were! They will

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.230
parrot our sentences. Like a recorded tape.
That is not listening! That is hearing! Says

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:50.510
Simon Sinek. We have met him earlier too.
He says, “Listening is an art! It is not

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.899
involving just the ears. If you are able to
repeat what you heard, it just means that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.280
your ears are working fine. That’s all!
But there are many more organs involved in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.700
the art of listening! There has to be eye
contact! Occasionally, your mouth should work

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.710
and play the role of encouraging the speaker!
You need to understand what was spoken, with

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
the help of your brain! THAT is listening!
They have even giving it a term! The LOST

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:47.500
ART of Listening! That is what we are going
to talk about today!

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.410
Namaste! Active Listening! They have called
it a LOST ART! How do we get that back? How

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.759
do we become a good listener? (Which, people
say, is an important foundation to become

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:08.200
a good communicator!) How do we LISTEN? How
do we pay ATTENTION? Let’s collect some

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.709
wisdom!

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.680
Many researchers have found out that there
is a fundamental reason why we are not good

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:33.450
listeners! For, .. our brain is much much
much more powerful and hence faster than this

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.689
speaking organ called the mouth. There is
a person in front of you. Even if they do

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.480
an amazing job of speaking, even if they are
communicating something very very important,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.990
the words come out only at a specific rate.
Not more than a hundred words a minute or

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.750
so. But, our ability to process, our ability
to process multiple things, “What’s that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.650
noise there?”, we are distracted, “What’s
that bright light there?”, “What’s this

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.090
strange sensation on my skin?”, everything
is being processed simultaneously. So, frankly

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:16.709
speaking, we can’t be blamed. We have to
blame just our brains. For, this is how you

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.400
think, while that is how they can speak. They
call it the Tortoise — Hare Situation. Whenever

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.340
something fast is happening, if we try and
connect a patently slow thing with it, of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.140
course the fast-one will be distracted! If
you remember the Hare and the Tortoise story,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.629
isn’t that what happened there too? Only
because the Hare was perhaps BORED that the

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:52.359
competition was nowhere to be seen, he went
to sleep! Distracted! So, don’t be too hard

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.680
on yourself!

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:06.760
Her name is Marilyn Vos Savant. She holds
a record. The highest IQ score EVER, by anybody!

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.920
She reached that score at the age 10. A score
of 228! And, after that, she has attempted

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.670
it multiple times too, and has consistently
been rated the smartest person on the planet.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.790
228! But, you know what? Researchers say,
if you are smart, if you are creative, if

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:30.860
you are imaginative, by nature, you may not
be a great listener. For, to listen well,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.840
you shouldn’t allow the horse of your imagination
gallop unbridled! You can’t dream on and

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.090
on about other alternatives, other scenarios,
all the time! You have to POUR YOURSELF into

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:51.380
the act. Very creative, smart people, are
not able to do that. There is another matter

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.640
too. These introverts? The ones who don’t
talk much? It is a myth that such people are

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.280
great listeners! Not so! Just because they
don’t talk much doesn’t mean they listen

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.250
well. Research has shown. I am not saying
it!

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:19.070
There is a book like this. You’re Not Listening!
By Kate Murphy. What you’re missing, and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:29.530
why it matters. In this book, I encountered
a very beautiful excerpt, and I wanted to

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:39.340
share that with you. That excerpt says, “Listening
is to be likened to an act of Meditation!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:48.100
Take any book about meditation, go to any
guru, and they’d all say one thing. One

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.660
very important thing. Distractions WILL happen.
Don’t try to shoo them away. Don’t try

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.850
to say that you won’t see them, you won’t
listen to them, you won’t touch them, you

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.950
won’t mind them.. It is impossible! It is
impossible to control the Mind Monkey. You

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:14.510
will waver! Give in to that temptation. And,
after you given in, and after the distraction

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:22.100
blows over, bring that monkey back in, focus
again. Beginners in meditation almost always

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.490
get this bit of advice only, again and again.
They will never be told to JUST FOCUS on ONE

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.160
THING. For, that is impossible! All they’d
say is, you have to acknowledge that there

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:42.240
is a distraction, treat it with respect, push
it away once it clamours and gets that attention,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.620
push it away, focus back again. Keep coming
back!” Kate Murphy says, this is exactly

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.600
what you need to practice during listening
too.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:04.490
There’s another thing she shares — a quote
by Stephen Covey. “Most people do not listen

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:15.100
with the intent to understand; they listen
with the intent to reply”. When will I get

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:33.360
the mic? When will you 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.940
stop talking so that I can… This is the
mentality that we need to change — says

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.720
Stephen Covey.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:53.281
There is an amazing dancer — her name is
Monica Bill Barnes. She is a presenter, she

00:07:53.281 --> 00:08:02.330
is a communicator. She is a communicator with
her body! She has said something about the

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:09.170
Art of Listening. Poetic. Highly relevant.
She says, “Listening is a matter of you

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:16.110
deciding you don’t need to worry what to
say next! Take it in without worrying how

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:25.450
you are going to react, what words you are
going to use. THAT is the pinnacle of listening.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:33.860
That is what allows someone else’s opinions
to temporarily take hold of your soul. Enter

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.120
its every atom. BECOME YOU for a while. Allow
your whole soul, your intellect, your ALL,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:53.050
to be impacted a bit,.. and then you can drive
it away. But, allow it in. Allow it to get

00:08:53.050 --> 00:09:00.890
past your border defences. Stop obsessing
and fearing about what you are going to say

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:07.130
next! It requires a lot of trust. The speaker
has to trust the listener. The listener has

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.440
to trust the speaker.”

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:23.250
I saw this famous book. It was called “Listen
like you mean it” by Ximena Vengoechea.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.921
She talks about eleven different types of
listeners! Eleven categories! Let us look

00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:38.080
at each of them, quickly. Decide for yourselves,
what type YOU are!

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:50.070
Category Number One. This guy is The Explainer.
You talk about any situation, “Oh, is that

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:58.530
so, did your boss shout at you, are you at
risk of losing your job, you know why, you

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:06.800
must have done this, he must have felt like
that, of course that is why this is happening,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.730
let us analyse, let us draw a blueprint, let
us put an action plan, and this is why that

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.990
is happening, do you remember that? do you
remember that dotted line from there? And

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:28.560
that other incident that happened the other
day at office?” He is The Explainer. A rational,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.490
scientific explanation for everything. The
problem is, we don’t want explanations sometimes.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.960
We don’t want everything broken down and
analysed as a sequence of events! The speaker

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:47.820
might think, “I don’t want to listen to
that lecture from you!” Sometimes! So, The

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:55.080
Explainer is a good role, but careful, don’t
over-explain!

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:02.910
The Second Role is The Validator. What does
HE do? “Oh, you’ve lost your job? I understand.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:09.970
I completely do. That guy is ALWAYS like that.
I knew something like this would happen. Every

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:17.030
person who comes from that town? They are
ALL the same. They behave just like this.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:24.640
Anybody who passes out of that college with
that degree, they act as if…” They validate.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:35.000
They resonate. They take your side. They become
a cheerleader. The problem is, .. yes, there

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.300
are benefits. You will feel, “Oh, wow, I
have company. Somebody understands”. But

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.820
the problem is, it will boost your ego. You
may have lost your job because of a mistake

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.740
you made, but you may still end up thinking
you are the best employee ever, and you can

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:54.980
commit NO MISTAKES! So, The Validator, Type
Number Two.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.860
Type Number Three is The Identifier. The Identifier..
“Oh, you’ve lost your job? Oh… Guess

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:15.100
what happened? Last time? Just two years ago,
man. I went through the same thing. And, you

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:21.670
know what happened? The boss called me. He
sent me a mail. He said, I hadn’t done…”

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:29.400
You take over. Yes, you identified with that
person. You said, “I am here to commiserate!”

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:36.690
But, you took over. And the game changed to
YOU being the victim. You started reliving

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:42.029
YOUR PAST. The other guy is feeling “Hey,
I am crying here. Look at me. Give me attention!”

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:50.100
So, The Identifier is useful, but sometimes,
the person who started the conversation, will

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:57.220
get the feeling, “Hey, Is it always about
you? Is the whole world spinning around you

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.630
perhaps? I exist too, man!” That would be
a problem!

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.730
The next type is The Problem Solver. I am
sure you all can relate to this guy. He is

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:19.580
the Problem Solver. The Problem Solver always
look at any conversation as a situation. A

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:27.240
problem waiting for a solution. An action
plan. An implementation. “Oh, you’ve lost

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:35.360
your job? Hmm.. Okay, that’s alright. Come
on now. Let us create a profile in Naukri.com.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.720
Tell me about your… Have you updated your
resume? Okay, bring your resume… What is

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:50.300
this.. Let us change it..” Biased towards
action. But, there is a problem there too.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:58.020
Sometimes, there MAY BE no problem at all!
It may just be a perception! Our Problem Solver

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:05.240
is going to dish out six different solutions
to a NON-EXISTENT problem! Sometimes, the

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:15.770
Speaker just wants a Listener! Not a problem
solver. So, be judicious about that!

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:25.990
This person is The Nurse. Who is a Nurse?
My problems, my needs, my demands on time,

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:33.170
my health, my need and desire for love and
affection, I push all of those away, and say,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:38.870
“You are the center of my attention. I will
do everything for you. I will go the extra

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:44.839
mile. I will take your problems as mine. I
am here to help you!” So, “Oh, you’ve

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:51.589
lost your job? Hmm… (Calls mom…and says
“Amma, I won’t be coming home tonight.

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:57.160
I have to be there with him. The next two
days, don’t expect me back at home….”)

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:04.220
Hey, come on, I will take care of you. Do
you want any money now?” He takes the problem.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:11.490
He becomes part of your.. the army that supports
you. But, sometimes, particularly when trust

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.980
hasn’t been established up front, it tips
the balance… The speaker starts wondering,

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.250
“Hey, I am already regretting every passing
moment, angry at how the world is treating

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:29.930
me. Now, by helping me so much, by doing so
much good Karma, you are adding the burden

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:36.400
of… oh my god, I have another person to
pay back some day?…” Do you see the problem

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:44.580
there? So, that balance shouldn’t tip too
much. You give. You take. Probably give more

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:51.190
than you take. But, don’t give your ALL.
Don’t be The Nurse. He has to stand on his

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:58.800
own legs. So, help him. But, don’t hold
him aloft, above your head. Be the crutch.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.550
Not the bus!

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:10.089
This guy is pretty dangerous. He is called
The Defuser. The Defuser… okay, everybody

00:16:10.089 --> 00:16:20.459
is kind and good-hearted of course, but The
Defuser approaches the situation thus. Any

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:27.760
problems, they try to make them disappear
with probably levity or joking. “Oh, you’ve

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:34.800
lost your job? Oh, that boss? That skinhead
dimwit? Why are you even working with such

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:42.300
goodfornothings? Now is your chance. Come
on. Let us go! Remember that trip we had been

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:51.540
planning for a long long time? To Goa? Hop
in! Let’s go!” Joking, levity, pooh-poohing

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:59.350
the problem away, suspending reality and the
truth, the gravity of the situation, … all

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:04.800
this may sound good. Make great scripts for
movies.. but when you come back, after the

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:12.889
hangover, the situation would only have gotten
worse! Some Defusers work even more rashly!

00:17:12.889 --> 00:17:23.499
“Oh, you’ve lost your job? Give me your
phone! Isn’t he the guy? Let me make a prank

00:17:23.499 --> 00:17:31.299
call to him. Hey, nincompoop! What sorta arrogant
bullshit is this?” Do you understand what’s

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:38.240
happening here? That’s not how you defuse
a situation.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.779
This guy is The Mediator. This guy thinks
there are two sides for everything. He knows

00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:51.440
it. “Oh, you’ve lost your job? Oh, that
boss? I don’t he would do that unprovoked…

00:17:51.440 --> 00:18:03.110
Did you do anything wrong? Shall I talk to
him? There has to be another side to this.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:11.390
Why don’t we have an open conversation?
What do you think? Did you screw up? Think

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:18.659
hard.. I have experience with that person..”
That would be the line of argument The Mediator

00:18:18.659 --> 00:18:21.840
would take. The Speaker would think, “I
am already boiling here. And you are trying

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:29.590
to play from the opposite side of the table?
Just because you believe in some golden righteous

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:38.080
rule, unwavering middle path? Are you being
a friend here or a judge? But, that’s the

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.539
role of the mediator! If you are a Mediator-kind
of a listener, right when the other person

00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:50.139
is speaking, you’ll start thinking, “This
has happened to this guy only because this

00:18:50.139 --> 00:18:52.539
guy did this thing like this”.

00:18:52.539 --> 00:19:01.999
This person is The Empath. The person who
showers empathy and smothers you with love

00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:11.419
and support. In fact, you may be keeping silent!
Not wanting to tell anybody. “Why are you

00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:20.080
looking off today? Something wrong. What happened?
Tell me, come on, come on, tell me. What?

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:27.960
I hope you haven’t lost your job or something
like that!?” They start feeding information,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.990
so that they can fish information. Because
they sense, they are hypersensitive… But,

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:39.999
even here, unless you have that bridge of
trust between the two of you, you may be crossing

00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:46.240
the line, if you act as an Empath. Careful
about that!

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.739
This guy, he is The Interrupter! Look at this
picture.. Who’s talking, who’s listening?

00:19:52.739 --> 00:20:00.150
There seems to be no dialogue! Only intersecting
monologues! Both are talking! Probably the

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:05.389
lady is TRYING to say something, and the guy
is FINISHING her sentences! “What? You’ve

00:20:05.389 --> 00:20:11.230
lost your job?” That guy is starting to
respond, “That manager, he had given me

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:18.679
a…” And The Interrupter interjects “That
project, yes? I knew it!” Is this how you

00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:25.669
empathise with somebody who is telling about
their worst time in life? By interrupting

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:33.940
and trying to show your smartness and your
ability to sense? Sometimes, there are people

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:43.619
who listen by interrupting. I got your problem.
I know it now. Come on. Let’s move on!

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:49.309
This guy, is The Interviewer. He is asking
questions ALL THE TIME. “What? You’ve

00:20:49.309 --> 00:20:59.259
lost your job? When was this? What time did
it happen? Which project was this? What dress

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:04.990
were you wearing that day? Had that guy come
too? Was this other guy there too?” You

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:10.989
ask too many questions and you fragment the
narrative that the other person is trying

00:21:10.989 --> 00:21:14.399
to get across to you. There seems to be a
WORD to represent such questioners. The Askhole!

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:20.690
An Askhole is a person who asks too many questions!
They will suck the living daylights out of

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:27.200
you just by shooting question after question
at you! The Askhole! Don’t be the Askhole!

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:36.720
This guy, probably the last of the eleven,
is The Daydreamer. Dreaming all the time.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:43.259
That lady there is shouting at the top of
her voice. Belting out story after story.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:48.510
Listing issues. Crying that she lost her job.
And, they are giving you some instructions,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:56.090
they are giving you some expectations. But,
you have already tuned out. You are probably

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:03.809
dreaming about… The speaker might have spilt
just a word.. “I have lost my job. I just

00:22:03.809 --> 00:22:07.460
want to run away somewhere. Get away from
it all.” That’s it. This guy has already

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:15.700
booked tickets to Hawaii. Probably rented
out an island, a boat, and probably planned

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:23.639
for a dance there. That i s The Daydreamer.
The creative, imaginative person. Eleven different

00:22:23.639 --> 00:22:29.379
kinds of people. Why did we even learn about
them all? This understanding may help you

00:22:29.379 --> 00:22:37.460
to evaluate yourself. What kind of listener
am I? What is my default? What do I typically

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:46.870
end up doing? That will help. Secondly, when
speaking, if you can identify this in your

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:53.519
listener… “Oh, this person is becoming
an interrupting listener, .. this person doesn’t

00:22:53.519 --> 00:23:00.499
mean ill. But, that’s the way they are..”
To learn is to understand. To understand is

00:23:00.499 --> 00:23:02.029
to forgive! Useful again!

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:11.970
As a closing thought, this guy. I want to
introduce him to you. His name is Julian Treasure.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:24.499
What a name! Julian TREASURE! We will be meeting
him again, in a future Quotidian. But, he

00:23:24.499 --> 00:23:31.269
has spoken in two TED platforms. The first
one is about “How to speak so that people

00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:39.119
want to listen”. But, a couple of years
before that, he gave another TED Talk “How

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:48.570
to listen better”. How to speak better,
how to listen better. Look at the numbers!

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:57.919
34 million people want to speak so that others
will listen. Only 4 million people want to

00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:07.289
listen better. This is the problem with this
world, says Julian. Let more people practice

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:15.700
the art of active listening! All the best.
Hope you listened to this well, it has dragged

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:28.409
on longer than usual, but there were eleven
categories I had to cover. We will meet soon.

00:24:28.409 --> 00:24:33.600
Till then, thank you!
