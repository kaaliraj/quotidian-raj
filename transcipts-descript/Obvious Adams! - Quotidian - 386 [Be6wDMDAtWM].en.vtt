00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.970
There was this secure industrial estate. At
the entrance to that estate, there was this

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:15.589
security guard and for nearly twenty years,
every Friday, there will be this man who takes

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:22.820
a wheelbarrow filled with something. It is
hay. And, hay is allowed to be taken outside.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.300
Hay. But, the security guard smelt a rat..
This guy looked sneaky and seemed to be cheating,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:36.380
stealing something hidden inside the hay.
For many years, he used laser beams and scanners

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.260
on the wheelbarrows, he conducted a lie-detector
test on the guy, but he was never able to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:51.150
find out what he was stealing in those wheelbarrows.
Guess what happened when this guy retired?!

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:12.210
Namaste!
386th episode. And, we are talking about something

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.509
we have touched upon earlier too. The obviousness
of some solutions. Velippadai Vimala. Or,

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.429
Obvious Adams.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:34.299
See, THIS was the Declaration of Independence.
In 1776, the American Declaration, the key

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:43.859
passage starts like this. We hold these truths
to be self-evident. That is how it starts.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:51.030
It is self-evident. It goes without saying.
It is obvious for anybody with basic common

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.750
sense.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.090
That phrase — self-evident. I don’t even
need to spell it out. It is THAT obvious.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.100
But then, why are they putting it up in the
Declaration of Independence? Sometimes, the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.380
most obvious, the most self-evident things,
need to be probably laid out.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:27.710
This man is Friedrich Gauss. This famous mathematician,
even at a very young age, showed a lot of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.140
aptitude for mathematics! There is even this
apocryphal story about him. The math teacher,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.350
as she was busy, as the kids were making too
much noise in class, wanting to keep them

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.920
all engaged, she plans to give them a hard
a problem, hoping to keep them busy with calculations

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.590
for a long period, hoping to do her work during
that time. This math teacher gives them a

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.920
summation problem.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:02.180
She says — Total the numbers one to hundred.
And give me the answer. Less than 30 seconds

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.530
later, Friedrich comes in and says, “Ma’am,
I have finished solving the problem”. “Whaaat”,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.400
she exclaims, “Already?”. The teacher
is shocked. And, that’s when the OBVIOUS

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.680
answer comes out from Gauss. What’s the
OBVIOUS answer?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.370
Well, Gauss says, “See, I looked at the
first and the last. I looked at the second

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.370
and the second to last. I looked at the third…
and so on…! I realised each of them summed

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:44.790
up to 101. There were fifty such. And, that’s
how I calculated my sum!” And that’s how

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.470
Gauss shocks the maths teacher. The obvious
sometimes stares you in the face.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:05.650
Virender Sehwag, we know him, the swashbuckling
mad genius that he was, in 2017, he was applying

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.790
for a coach role for the Indian cricket team.
Somebody seems to have encouraged him, and

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.829
it seems he sent two sentences. Just two.
I have played for the Indian team. And, I

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.539
know these boys very well. Just two sentences.
He didn’t get selected. And, we are not

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.400
sure whether that was good or bad for the
team, in retrospect! But, two sentences. Stating

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.560
the obvious.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.810
In Twitter, many people took this viral, and
gave some mock responses too. One tweet said,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:49.020
“See ball. Hit ball.” That was his philosophy
all along. No respect to the bowler. And,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:57.530
no respect to his own score. The number of
centuries that he scored moving from 95 to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.690
101 by smashing a sixer is the story of legend.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.080
Another tweet said, “309. 319.” It is
a reference to something that even Sachin

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.850
couldn’t reach. Two triple centuries in
Test matches. Stating the obvious.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:24.270
This is what I want to talk to you about today.
I recently encountered a book titled “Obvious

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:32.699
Adams”. It came out during the First World
War. A book from 1916. Robert Updegraff is

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:40.169
the author. Nice name, don’t you think?
If you read him, you will go “up de graph”!

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:54.900
It is touted to be the most important marketing
book that you haven’t heard of. The best

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.020
marketing book that you haven’t heard of!
Well, wanting to know what on earth such a

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.360
book contained, I dove in. It is a 65-page
book. That’s all. You can finish reading

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:16.289
it in probably 25–30 minutes. But, it is
about the obvious. And, it is about how hard

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:25.630
it is to approach it in the obvious manner.
Too often, we make things too hard. We get

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:34.460
too cute. We try too much. And we forget…
that the approach is basically, identify the

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:44.849
essential, state it very clearly, as clearly
as possible, and execute it in as straightforward

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:52.289
a manner as possible. “Just doing that is
enough” is the essence of this book!

00:06:52.289 --> 00:07:00.050
It is about a guy, Mr. Adams. He gets the
name “Obvious Adams” later. And, Mr. Adams

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:08.819
actually sees a very famous advertising agency,
sees their output, and falls in love with

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:16.710
it. And he decides, this should be my career
path. What does he do next? He walks straight

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.360
to that company. To its headquarters. Meets
the person at the frontdesk. And says, “I

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:31.350
am here to meet Mr. Oswald”. “Okay, but
he is a very busy man.. I don’t know if

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:37.969
you have an appointment”, she says. “Well,
I will wait till 10:35 AM”, says Adams.

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:44.789
He has COME for the interview, and he is declaring
how long he would wait… But that was the

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:49.680
obvious thing. Because he had something else
to do that day, he stated the obvious! Intrigued

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.089
by this, Mr. Oswald, realises that there is
somebody unique and interesting and invites

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:03.339
this guy into the room. And, Oswald wants
to know what’s up and that guy says:- “I

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:11.069
am enamoured by your amazing quality of output.
I want to be in this field. I want to work

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:19.729
with you. Failing which, I might compete with
you.” A kid. Born just yesterday. Declares

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:25.389
“Take me into your company, or I might end
up a competitor, because I am sold on the

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:32.050
idea of advertising, and I would be doing
that for my life. So, take me, or… fight

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:40.039
me!” Seeing that this boy is unique and
unusual, he recruits him.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:46.240
The second lesson that we learn in the life
of Obvious Adams is.. this boy is not immediately

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:53.760
given the role of a Creative Director. He
is asked to work in the Mail Room. Clean stuff.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.730
Move papers. He DOES that. And he comes up
with approaches where one could save half

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:05.870
an hour if something were optimised. Approaches
where one could reduce errors if something

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.550
were done differently. New and innovative
solutions. And then, one day, during a coffee

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:18.779
break, he meets Mr. Oswald and says: “Actually
you can recruit a girl for half my salary,

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:25.720
and she can do the work that I am doing. I
think I am capable of doing much more”.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:32.570
He greets the boss with this claim. Up for
a challenge, Oswald takes it up, and gives

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:39.270
him a better role. But again, the best advertising
campaigns don’t come to Mr. Adams. What

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:45.509
does Adams do? He does those campaigns in
parallel. Even after knowing that there is

00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:51.490
no chance for Oswald to see the work he is
doing in parallel, for the sheer experience,

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:58.130
for the exposure, he creates similar, parallel,
advertising campaigns, that nobody gets to

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:04.800
see. Until, one day, when Oswald comes to
Adams’ room for something else, he sees

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:12.870
these scratched up notes lying on the table
casually. And he sees some gold nuggets there.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:19.970
He takes them up and realises that these are
probably better than the campaigns that he

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:31.180
has been running. So, the lesson here? Do
your work! Today, the trend seems to be automation,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:36.209
optimisation, outsourcing… people are looking
to replace people with processes! Just doing

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:44.040
what you are asked to do, just being obedient
and prompt is not enough! Go the extra mile!

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.790
Remember the phrase people use in the workplace?
“He is such a gem!” — What do you think

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:58.330
that gem refers to? G E M. Go the Extra Mile!
Did you get it??

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:04.779
The third thing in the Obvious Adams book,
in the history, in the story of Obvious Adams,

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:12.600
is the way he understands the audience. He
goes to a paper mill. He learns how bondpaper

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:21.300
is manufactured there. And he writes his copy
for the ad. We use the purest of waters. We

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:31.370
roll it in the cleanest of environments. The
paper we use for it comes from the best of

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:38.810
trees. And so on. The paper-mill owner starts
laughing. Do you think we called you for this

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.351
sort of nonsense? Go to any paper mill and
you will learn that is how we do it. Every

00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:52.810
bondpaper is prepared like that. To which,
Obvious Adams asks him a question:- Hey, are

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:59.750
you selling paper to papermakers or paperusers??
I have been a paperuser for 25 years now.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:06.420
Until I visited your mill today, I didn’t
know that this was the process. And I am sure

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:14.160
that that is the story with everybody out
there! So, do the obvious! And make it synonymous

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:21.629
with your brand. And that is how you build
a competitive advantage from the others who

00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:29.310
come and catch up later. So, that is how he
promotes the papermill brand and that becomes

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:35.540
very famous. We have seen too many campaigns
that seem to say the same thing, the thing

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:40.230
that everybody else says anyway. But, that
stating of the obvious, that repetition a

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.600
thousand times so the people finally get it?
The credit goes to the person who manages

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.440
to do that!
And finally, he says, Thinking is the hardest

00:12:50.440 --> 00:13:00.350
thing we all do. The brain is lazy! People
need to be reminded much more often than they

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:07.480
need to be instructed. Saying things ONCE
is NOT enough!

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.490
For example, your brain is so lazy that it
didn’t read all those Yous.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:22.730
Not just that! Your brain is SO lazy that
it didn’t notice that one of those Yous

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.110
was a Yoo! Try looking for it!

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:32.620
So, having been cursed with a lazy brain like
that, the reality of the matter is.. Everything

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:41.670
that needed to be said, has already been said.
Yes. But, not everybody was listening, and

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.959
so, it deserves to be said again!!

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:53.329
I saw a book recently — Psychology of Money
— is the title. We will talk a lot about

00:13:53.329 --> 00:14:01.670
it in future episodes. Morgan Housell is the
name of the author. He brings up a beautiful

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:15.300
reference from Napoleon. Regarding war strategy.
Which Morgan says, is so relevant even in

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:24.540
the world of investing. What is that? He says,
“Investing genius is all about doing the

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:32.221
AVERAGE thing when all those around are going
crazy!” It is not about doing special and

00:14:32.221 --> 00:14:40.070
amazing things! Do the average thing! Do the
most obvious thing. Too many people are missing

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.000
it out. Too many people are getting too cute,
overthinking.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.670
Remember that story? What WAS he stealing
after all? Finally, on the day of his retirement,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.970
he confronts the guy and asks, “I can’t
arrest you now. You are retiring. I am retiring

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.089
soon too. You surely were stealing something,
weren’t you?” To which that guy is supposed

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:11.680
to have responded with, “I was stealing
wheelbarrows!” Isn’t it obvious now?!

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.450
We will meet again on the fifteenth. Thank
you!
