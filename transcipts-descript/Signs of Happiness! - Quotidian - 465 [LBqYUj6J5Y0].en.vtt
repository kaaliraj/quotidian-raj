00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.040
You know this old man, don’t you?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.740
The “Oracle of Omaha”, they called him.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.860
Warren Buffett.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:17.500
He once said.., (well, I am not sure if he
was the original person who came up with the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:27.720
quote, or if he was quoting somebody in his
Tweet.. he is so knowledgeable, it could have

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.980
well been him!, but I remember seeing this
quote as from somebody else too))..

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:42.550
It seems he said, “Money is not everything”..
he didn’t stop there.. he said, “Money

00:00:42.550 --> 00:01:03.590
is not everything, but make enough of it before
you mouth such bullshit!”

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:18.020
Namaste!

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.890
Four Sixty Five is about the Signs of Happiness.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.690
Signs.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.479
Science..

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.490
At Zoho Schools, just a couple of weeks ago,
we finished one more year.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.470
One more successful year, of training students.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.829
And, for the Tech community, we used this
book as a very important reference to the

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.100
world of software engineering.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.240
This is Jeff Atwood, and he has been maintaining
a blog for a very long time.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.759
And, he had picked some of the best articles
from his blog and made it into a book.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.530
Effective Programming — More than just writing
code!

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.429
You must remember StackOverflow, of course.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.849
He is the cofounder of StackOverflow!

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.840
If he speaks, there is great benefit in listening!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.730
What I liked best about this book though was
the last chapter of the book that we reviewed

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.370
on the last day of the course.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.450
Very interestingly, that last chapter talked
about Happiness..

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.300
“Hey, do you want to be happy?

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.370
Really, truly, happy?

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.269
Remember these eight points”.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.660
They start by first saying that it is not
about money.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.569
We have encountered this theme in earlier
Quotidians too.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.140
Beyond a particular threshold, just adding
more money to your takehome salary will not

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.109
add to your Happiness Bucket.

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.380
They call that the Fulfilment Curve.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.220
There is Money Spent on the X-Axis.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.200
And, there is Fulfilment on the Y-Axis.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.870
For a while, things look good and rosy.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.549
During the Survival Phase, you get more fulfilment
as you get more money.

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:29.220
Then comes the Comfort Phase, where, even
though the curve has started to plateau slowly,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.830
you still have the same trusted formula — More
Money, More Happiness.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.379
Then you get to the Luxury Phase..

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.439
Something that is available perhaps just to
one in a million.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.849
Those rare pleasures.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.310
An amazing car perhaps.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.099
A large bungalow perhaps.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.450
A world tour perhaps.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.310
I don’t know what your definition of luxury
is, but, until that point is reached, the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.439
curve continues.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.879
But after that, you reach a point where you
have to say Enough.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.629
For, beyond that, it is Decadence and Extravagance.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.229
You will actually feel LESS FULFILLED when
you spend more.

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:30.250
In many countries, across many decades, and
multiple times, they have conducted this research.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:38.850
And, they have arrived at a simple thumbrule:
If you want to be optimally happy, you should

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:48.451
ensure that you don’t earn LESS than three
times the povery-line amount in your country.

00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:52.360
I gave you the bit about “Should not earn
LESS than”.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.139
But, there is another bit too!

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.449
“Shouldn’t earn MUCH MORE than” too,
the authors add!

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:06.699
Whatever the poverty scale is in your country,
you should aim to stabilise at around thrice

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.660
that amount, not less, not more!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.370
Let us now jump into those eight interesting
lessons that the article gives us.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:28.710
All of those are based on the Maslow’s Hierarchy
— we have encountered this before too.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.820
Lower levels being more important and fundamental,
but eventually, you start realising that the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.229
higher ones are those that give you true,
lasting, happiness.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.460
All of those eight beautiful lessons take
us on a journey aimed towards the higher echelons

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.050
of the pyramid.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.710
The first lesson is about “What do you collect”..

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.350
Do you collect objects?

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.760
Do you collect things?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.510
Do you collect material possessions?

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.569
Or, do you collect experiences?

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:11.940
For, when you collect things, they get old,
they will break..

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.050
They will become ordinary..

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.240
they will laugh at me if I flaunt my iPhone
7 around!

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.240
They will become ordinary.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.840
They will wear out.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.710
And, you can’t really share them!

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.520
Compare this with experiences?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.460
They never get old.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:42.490
In fact, an experience GROWS in grandeur and
magnitude after every retelling!

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.690
The story gets better and better!

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:52.990
When you start your “That thundering slide
down the slope on my skis in the Swiss Alps…”,

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.040
you are reliving that experience.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.940
It never gets old.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.819
No wear and tear.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:06.050
Nor does it become costlier, like it does
with things, when the price of goods goes

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.630
up due to inflation and other reasons.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.879
Experiences stick with you, and not only are
they easy to share..

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:17.410
Sharing IS THE THING about the experience.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:23.819
Sharing when it is happening, sharing when
it is going to happen, sharing after it has

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:24.819
happened.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:31.979
So, if you are going to spend, spend them
on collecting experiences, not on collecting

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.610
things.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:45.030
The second advice the book gives us is, “Focus
on the progress of others, not just on yours

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.030
own”.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:52.000
Only in helping them reach higher, do you
actually rise.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.690
When you do a Google search, the most frequently
seen image would be this.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:05.390
A guy, having climbed, turns back, to help
the other person behind them.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:14.330
But, I would actually want to take it a little
further, I will stretch it and say, why not

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:21.940
think about situations like these, where,
you don’t actually go up.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.460
You help the others go.. sometimes higher
than you.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:33.360
That pleasure you derive from that?

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:43.330
A teacher, a guru, that pleasure they get
when they see their students climb great heights..

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.160
higher than they ever reached.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.649
Man is a social animal.

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:59.480
What can I do to the others around me, so
I can see happiness in their faces, and from

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.890
that, derive my own reflected joy..?

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.880
That is one of the key principles of longterm
joy.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:18.260
So, these authors say, try and integrate into
your daily life, your day-to-day-routine,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.130
some kind of spending (could be time, could
be money) for the sake of others.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:31.890
Some amount of time, some amount of money,
for the sake of others.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:37.089
Do that, and you will know true joy!

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:44.430
Number Three is to focus on the small, not
as much on the big.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.700
Do you remember this song?

00:09:49.700 --> 00:10:04.310
From “The Sound of Music” — a song that
goes “These are a few of my favourite things”.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:13.779
Simple, plain, raindrops on roses, whiskers
on kitten, copper tea kettle..

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:21.660
If you can find joy in those simple things,
if you can split your joy into a multitude..

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:30.420
many.. rather than focus on one big bang,
you are probably likelier to be happier.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.399
Why so?

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:41.410
Well, when you focus all your happiness on
the achievement of one thing, the heart has

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.389
a strange way of handling stress.

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:47.070
It has a safety valve.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.410
Too much pain, too much pleasure, the safety
valve takes over.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:58.399
Remember the “cloying of pleasure” and
the “inuring to pain”?

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.510
Activated!

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:08.940
And so, when you are looking forward to something
too much, you don’t really enjoy it as much

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.180
as you could have if you had broken it up
into many parts..

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:18.910
Split it up, they say!

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:27.900
The key takeaway there is, when it comes to
happiness, don’t focus on the intensity,

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.630
focus instead on the frequency.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:37.990
Not how large a spike, but how many spikes
in your emotional equilibrium!

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.280
Nice idea!

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.310
Number Four is about insurance.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.620
This is no big deal, not something we don’t
know, anyway.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:51.959
Beware of all these insurance scams…

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:55.329
Why?

00:11:55.329 --> 00:12:00.320
Most of the time we are sold stuff because
we are afraid of loss.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:09.540
Life loss, loss due to fire, loss due to earthquake,
.. yes, if they happen, it is going to be

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.580
really painful.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:17.380
But, the amount of money you spend trying
to protect yourself, is imbalanced, say the

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.380
authors.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.930
They also point at another paradox here.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.860
It so happens that those who are insured go
around “courting disaster” because “they

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.970
have insurance after all”!

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.510
Worse, because your inner mind is constantly
telling you that you have insurance against

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:44.520
risk, the true joy of taking that leap of
faith, leaping into that risky adventure,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.350
is diluted a bit because, “you have insurance
after all”!

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.769
So, beware of taking on too much insurance..

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:57.660
Beware of return clauses..

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:03.579
Don’t buy stuff just because they have a
no-questions-asked return policy!

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:10.329
It takes away the joy of experiencing something
new!

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:15.470
Number Five is about Pay Now Consume Later.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:22.140
These days, the trend seems to be “Buy Now
Pay Later”..

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.670
Turn that around.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.240
Do you really need it?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.890
Do you need this specific brand and model?

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.279
Do you need it right now?

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:35.329
Keep asking..

00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:38.190
Remember the marshmallow test?

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:46.399
Little children offered a sweet now, versus
two sweets if only they could wait half an

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:53.910
hour.. delaying gratification has a direct
correlation to success in their career.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:02.980
So, learn to delay, learn to consume later.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.740
Number Six is the act of reflection.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.510
We think..

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:15.040
But, do we think about the fact that we are
thinking?

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.940
The act of thinking about thinking.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.760
We all know what we think about.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.920
Do we know the process of our thinking?

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.790
The How?

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:34.790
Do we spend time analysing WHY we think the
way we think?

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.589
(Start with WHY).

00:14:36.589 --> 00:14:38.990
Why is this important?

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.699
Very often, we do System 1 thinking.

00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:47.360
That fast, rash, instantaneous thoughtless
thinking.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.880
And we fall into decisions.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.880
Give it time.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.580
Let the sleepy, lethargic, smart and wise
System 2 wake up!

00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.630
You are going to buy a thing.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:07.730
Don’t just dwell idly on the pleasures that
you are going to receive when you are with

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:13.009
it, the joys you will get when you use it.

00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:16.080
Here is something else you might want to think
about.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:22.589
When you are going to take it home, where
are you going to place it??

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.089
And what was there till then?

00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:31.310
When you are going to take it home, when are
you going to use it??

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:36.600
And what were you doing at that time, till
then?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.920
You are going to have to do “replacement”.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.750
The area available in your house?

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.750
Finite.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.870
The time you have at your disposal?

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.870
24 hours.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.870
Limited.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.940
If a new thing comes along, what are you going
to have to throw away?

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.080
Think about that too.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.850
Number Seven is about comparison.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:05.579
We have already seen the Apple-Orange comparison.

00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:08.980
We have learned that such comparisons are
flawed.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.980
But, the authors?

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.040
They say, most comparisons are arbitrary and
misleading, and so, don’t lower yourself

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.100
into that just because it is available!

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:21.279
Comparisons are unnecessary and sometimes
they are dangerous for you.

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:26.160
Look at this chart, from a product company
called Mailchimp.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.579
Talking about three types of service offerings.

00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:29.579
Different pricing schemes.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:37.649
Nearly nobody is going to opt for that costliest
pricing scheme, far left.

00:16:37.649 --> 00:16:38.980
Nobody.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.959
But, it is there for a very important reason.

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:52.269
It is there to show that the other pricing
schemes are.. quite friendly on the pocket.

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:58.600
“Hey, sounds great value for money, if you
compare it with that..”

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.110
But, wait, why are you even comparing?!

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.110
That is the point.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.299
Look for what you are going to need.

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:05.299
Think about that.

00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:10.650
Don’t compare for the sake of comparison.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.930
And finally, the eighth advice they give us…

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.990
This one kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.610
I am not fully convinced..

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:30.210
The authors say, “Follow the herd, not the
head”..

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:35.950
The world is beating a particular path, like
a herd of mindless sheep.. but, don’t jump

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.500
to a derogatory verdict too soon..

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:46.360
Over time, over many generations, they have
each learned what is happening..

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:52.250
A million people can’t be wrong.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.540
Understand what the world says about something..

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.289
Too often, we overestimate our uniqueness,
the authors say.

00:17:59.289 --> 00:18:08.390
That we are one in a million, that our way
of thinking is unique, that our desires and

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.030
motives are different from everybody else,
.. etc.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.460
Probably, we are overdoing it.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:19.520
We are more like everybody else than we want
to agree..

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:29.240
And so, understand what the users say, watch
what their opinion is, and then take your

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240
decisions.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:38.480
So, eight beautiful lessons, from three authors,
in a book about software engineering.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:52.110
I felt these were good lessons for life, applicable
to anybody, not just software engineers, and

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.039
that is why I decided to share these with
you.

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.580
That brings us to the Closing Thought.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.559
And, who are those three people?

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:02.530
Daniel Gilbert, Elizabeth Dunn, Timothy Wilson.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.020
Authors of topnotch best-sellers, each.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:11.970
They published a paper, and in that paper,
I found these eight lessons.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.909
Want to know the title of the paper?

00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:15.870
Here goes!

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:27.610
The title says, “If money doesn’t make
you happy, you probably aren’t spending

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.610
it right!”

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.610
How paradoxical!

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.210
We have heard of “Money doesn’t buy happiness”.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.419
We started with Buffett’s “Money isn’t
everything”.

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:46.380
And, these authors say, “You can make it
buy you happiness, but you need to follow

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.860
these eight scientific lessons!”

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.750
Alright, go shopping!

00:19:52.750 --> 00:20:02.410
We will meet again soon, thank you!
