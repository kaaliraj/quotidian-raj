00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:07.959
Frank Rand once made this interesting observation,
more than a hundred and fifty years ago…

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:18.230
He said, “I am not a bad guy, I am not undisciplined,
I am not an idiot, but what do I do…

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.410
All the things I like, if I end up liking
something or the other, it is either illegal,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.590
or it is immoral, or it is fattening..!

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.619
What do I do!”

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:41.670
There is a beautiful lesson hidden here for
lawmakers and team managers.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190
Let us see!

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.190
Namaste!

00:00:44.190 --> 00:01:09.440
When it comes to horse training, the trainers
highlight one little bit of advice.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.840
They say, techniques, tactics, can be many.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.270
That is not really important.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.270
But, principles..

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.080
a couple of crucial principles…

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.670
those are VERY important.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.980
Among those, among those important few principles,
they stress on this the most.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.250
They say, if you want that animal, that very
large, very strong, taller-than-you animal,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.380
to do as you want it to do, this is what you
need to do.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.890
Make the right thing easy, make the wrong
thing hard.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.260
Do you get it?

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.310
Whatever you want it to do, make it easy for
it to do it.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.360
What you don’t want it to be doing, make
it hard for it to do.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260
That is the magic it seems!

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.450
That is the magic of horse-training.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.730
Everything else derives from that.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.470
They call it “friction-removal”.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.060
Removing the unnecessary rubbing of opposing
forces.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.170
We have seen that with Facebook.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.820
If you have logged in using Facebook in some
page of some website that is associated with

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.840
this social network, a little tracker gets
activated, a little cookie is awake, and whichever

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.850
other website you visit from then on, it checks
if Facebook is acceptable currency there,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.580
and automatically, frictionlessly, they log
you in, and share your identity as a Facebook

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.810
member.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.300
Yes, it makes your experience better, but
it also helps Facebook keep track of what

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300
you are doing.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.700
The same Friction-Removal was adopted by Amazon
too.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.960
Every time you made a purchase, it didn’t
keep asking you for your full name, your delivery

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.430
address, your credit card details, etc, and
instead, perfected the One Click to purchase.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.870
When they do that, they are removing friction.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.990
Because, when you throw things into your shopping
cart, and enter checkout, it is a time-consuming

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.470
experience to answer four different questions,
click two different buttons, and go to “Buy”

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.470
at the end.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.709
And, this may lead to my abandoning this shopping
cart.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.470
So many more opportunities open up for this
abandonment.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.120
Make the right thing easy, make the wrong
things hard to do.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.120
The same principle has been stressed over
and over again, in this book.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.670
The book is called Nudge.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.010
It is not called Push.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.500
It is not called Shove.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.500
It is called Nudge.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.160
Slight, sideways, indirect, suggestive motion.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:31.040
In this book, the authors talk about how large
companies around the world have made small,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.970
very small changes, to how they laid their
office, to how they worked with their employees,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.520
that increased productivity, that increased
employee happiness.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.870
Here is a small example.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.440
Consider a snack bar.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.700
They just hid the unhealthy snacks away from
view, in a locked cupboard far away from easy

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.240
reach, and placed healthy fruits and nuts
in plain view, easy to reach, and that was

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.840
enough to nudge people to eat healthily!

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.580
Instead of locating the gym far away from
the main office building, placing it right

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.690
on the way to the parking lot helped more
people take notice about what was happening

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.130
there, and voila!

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.100
You become a gym member, you start practising,
and your fitness goes up!

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.770
Nudge!

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.730
Make the right thing easy!

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.770
We will look at some examples now!

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.230
Here is a trash can.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.890
A trash can in a Japanese supermarket.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.840
Immediately after seeing it, you realise where
I should be throwing my newspapers and where

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.400
I should throw my bottles and cans.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.780
It is immediately apparent.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.790
Nothing but making the right thing easy, direct,
and straightforward.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.540
Have you noticed this in highways?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.290
Cat’s Eyes they are called.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.520
When you are driving in the dark, small lights
glow.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.290
And show the way.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.729
But, why didn’t they level it smoothly with
the road?

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.090
Why the bump, bump, bump?

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.280
Well, just in case you nod off, if you close
your eyes drowsily, if your car unconsciously

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.620
veers off to the left or to the right, it
is not an accident yet, it is a wake-up call,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:29.190
a jarring bouncy bumpy wake up call, it jolts
you back into reality, and you save yourself,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.479
and save many others around.

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:34.690
The right thing is easy.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.449
You can drive smoothly.

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:37.530
The wrong thing?

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.530
Is harder.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.160
You must have seen the common housefly everywhere,
after all.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.770
But, this specific fly is supposed to have
appeared in the Amsterdam airport first.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.770
This fly.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.390
It really attracted people’s attention.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.790
What’s special about it?

00:06:53.790 --> 00:07:02.740
Well, it is from www.urinalfly.com — and,
you get the idea when you visit the website.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.330
The aim is to reduce spillage in the men’s
toilet.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.040
They just gave a target.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.680
The moment a small sticker was stuck in a
corner of the receptacle, as shown by the

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:25.430
arrow, do you see the sticker, people immediately
started playing the game, started focusing,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.040
and spillage was saved, and hygiene was improved.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.790
Make the right thing fun.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.259
Make the right thing easy.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:43.980
Steve Jobs, famous for many things, famous
also for his leadership at Pixar.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:50.570
Many amazing movies have come out under his
leadership.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:57.639
The office campus of this beautiful, amazing
company has a building called The Steve Jobs

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:58.840
Building.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:07.000
The Steve Jobs Building was designed by Steve
Jobs, he gave a lot of input to it, this was

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.070
one of two buildings he worked on extensively
before his untimely death, the other being

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.430
the Apple Headquarters.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.610
The seniors at Pixar even called this building
“Steve’s Movie” — after all, everything

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.110
important at Pixar is a movie!

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.730
Steve seemed to spend so much time and effort,
almost as if he were directing a movie, they

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.730
said.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:34.409
A beautiful, large atrium in the front, the
tech team in the left, straight ahead marketing

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.889
and other departments, and to the right, designers,
artists, graphics folks.

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:45.190
He wanted a place where all these people from
all these departments will mingle.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.410
He designed a huge atrium specifically for
that.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.720
And then, he said, “That is not enough.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.350
I want them to have chance encounters…

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.950
there must be many unexpected random meetings”
and, for such a large office complex, he proposed

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:07.029
that there be just one toilet facility for
this building, and that too, only near the

00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:08.029
ground floor atrium!

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:10.439
“That is when everybody will come and go,
pass by, meet people, and have chance encounters

00:09:10.439 --> 00:09:14.009
at least when they wash their hands!

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:16.160
Amazing ideas would fly!” he said!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.519
Okay, thankfully, his idea didn’t go through,
for there would have been a long queue outside,

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.519
otherwise!

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.920
But, I hope you get the message.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:35.019
His intent was to make interaction, collaboration,
group brainstorming, friction-free.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:37.800
He wanted to make the right thing…

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.029
not just easy.

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:41.569
He made it… inevitable!

00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:49.749
That is Steve Jobs for you!

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:52.569
These grass landscapes are a common sight.

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:58.550
With concrete pathways turning at ninety degrees,
or even acute angles.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.639
But, probably you must have seen this in Whatsapp
also…

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:06.889
You must have noticed that, after a while,
this happens.

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:10.519
Who are YOU to give me advice on how to go?!

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:15.160
Did you even think about it, before laying
the path?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.680
This is the path!

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.410
The short path.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.410
The straight path.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.410
The right path!

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.319
And the crowd decide to act by themselves.

00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:27.449
If the concrete path was the user interface,
the short-cut path was the user experience,

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:30.160
or so the joke went.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.269
But, did you know there is another layer to
this?

00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:35.470
I found that out only recently.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.649
There is this concept called The Desire Path,
it seems.

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:48.100
In many university spaces, and in other large
campuses, these days, they build the buildings,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.360
they don’t lay the paths.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.920
They just fill it with grass.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.550
And then, they let the crowd — they call
it the Wisdom of the Crowds — they let the

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.629
crowd form the paths.

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:07.540
A small foot-wide path appears, and the grass
wears away, and the path becomes even clearer

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:15.339
with no grass at all, and the realisation
sets in — Oh, is this the path you want

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:16.339
to use?

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:17.439
Is this how traffic flows from this building
to that?

00:11:17.439 --> 00:11:18.769
Not many actually go to that other building?

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:22.639
Those who go there avoid this route and often
take that other route?

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:33.730
The architects realise these practical truths,
learn, they come back after a year, and they

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.610
lay the concrete path ON TOP of the Desire
Pathways.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.420
They say, this is the right way to do it.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:50.360
If you think about it, it probably makes much
more sense than trying to lay down a path,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.670
and forcing people to use it.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:59.619
In Maharashtra, there is this village called
Shani Shingnapur.

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:00.869
A temple for Lord Shani.

00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:01.869
A “self-installed” statue of stone.

00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:03.559
It doesn’t even have a roof, this temple.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:06.249
My guess is it is a meteorite of some sort.

00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:13.429
They claim that this deity is very powerful,
and is famous and popular in the neighbourhood.

00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:16.459
This village has no fear of theft.

00:12:16.459 --> 00:12:22.249
So much so that they don’t even have doors.

00:12:22.249 --> 00:12:25.769
No locks, no doors even!

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:32.110
A village full of houses with no safety precautions.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.980
How did they manage it?

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.110
For hundreds of years!

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.320
No doors.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.140
No locks on the doors.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.920
I thought about it for a while.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.100
Make the right thing easy, make the wrong
thing hard — Remember?

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.559
This is a “Wrong thing hard”.

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.410
Did you think about it?

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.410
A village.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.410
Surrounded by a jungle.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.579
Only a person living in this village can steal
from a person living in this village.

00:12:56.579 --> 00:12:59.249
He has no door at his home.

00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:02.679
This guy has no door at his home either.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:07.589
Where will he hide the stolen goods?!

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.899
Make the wrong thing hard!

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:12.610
Do you get it?!

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:22.720
So, the lesson I take away from this is, if
you are a lawmaker, if you are a manager of

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.720
a team, where you lay down the code of ethics,
the culture, the principles that you will

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.980
follow as a team, just remember.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.009
Two things are very important.

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:39.839
That law has to be applicable to you too.

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:45.000
You can’t just lay it down — you have
to adopt it yourself.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.139
And, the law should aim to make the right
thing easy, … I am ready to do it.

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:54.069
I am ready to do the right thing.

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:58.899
But, you have made it so hard for me, because
of your silly laws… that should never be

00:13:58.899 --> 00:13:59.899
the situation!

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:05.459
And yes, it can strive to make the wrong thing
hard.

00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:07.260
That’s my takeaway.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:13.559
And, while talking about the wrong thing hard,
here is a classic example.

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:20.859
If you are watching TV, if you are addicted
to Netflix, what do you do?

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.910
Just throw away the remote.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:29.000
Every TV comes with all the controls on the
side of the TV.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.179
Everything can be done.

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:38.990
So, everytime you want to open up a new season,
new episode, go try doing it without your

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.990
remote.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:45.939
That is enough, the wrong thing is automatically
made hard.

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:47.649
Thank you!

00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:51.980
And, by the way, this is our schedule for
March.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.199
Looking forward to meeting you again on the
second of March!

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:57.500
Thank you!
