00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.000
A movie titled “Marudhamalai”, and Vadivel
does this in that movie!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.760
“Risk Edukkaradhellaam Enakku Rusku Saappidaramaadhiri!”

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:18.949
So, I like that scene, I have used that dialogue
myself many times, but there is a fundamental

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.470
flaw that I see there, in what he says…

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.079
If one is going to equate “risk taking”
to “rusk eating”…, do you realise that

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.490
if it is going to be that easy, it is no longer
a risk for you!

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.740
How should risks be, actually?

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.540
Remember the Vikram movie?

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.280
The policeman who lost his wife says, “The
underpart of my foot… will sweat!”

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.900
That is the kind of unnerving fear you are
supposed to get.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.620
THAT is a risk.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.540
Not when he can do it as easily as eating
a rusk!

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:08.220
Let’s see!

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.560
Namaste!

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.340
Four hundred and eighteen!

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.340
The Biggest Risk!

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.939
We were talking about risks, and we even quoted
the great Vadivel!

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.740
What is the biggest risk, and what are the
angles to consider?

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.100
Is risk-taking important?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.079
Having decided to take a risk, how do we get
started?

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.109
Let’s have a look!

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.710
I bumped into this book…

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.670
And, this is one of, probably four books that
we are going to encounter today!

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.070
Interesting books, each of them!

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.119
This was called, “Failed It!

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.049
How to turn mistakes into ideas and other
advice for successfully screwing up!” by

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.049
Erik Kessels.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.569
It is a pretty short book..

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.810
I enjoyed the book.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.970
And, what was more interesting than the book
itself was the table of contents!

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.560
This was the third page in the table of contents.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.180
Two main chapters.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.410
Fail to follow the rules.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.760
Fail to find inspiration.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.450
Only later did I notice the capital letter!

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.860
I started reading it differently, the way
the author had intended it to be read!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.410
Fail, to follow the rules!

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.910
Fail… to find inspiration!

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.460
Catch my point?!

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.520
Look at this scene…

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.180
A pretty common scene in villages and towns
in India.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.230
The tightrope walker.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:05.470
I will ask you two questions: WHO is being
observed by everybody?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.240
Who has the attention of EVERY bystander?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.270
And, the second question: WHO is taking a
risk!?

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.890
The three people standing on the ground below..

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.670
The one guy balancing himself up on the rope..

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.800
Who has all the attention?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.620
Who’s getting noticed?

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.650
So, there is a very clear lesson there!

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.570
If you want to get noticed in this noisy world,
where everybody wants to get noticed, you

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.710
HAVE to take a risk.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.400
You HAVE to go out on a limb.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.050
Here is another book I encountered.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.190
Yes, .. admittedly, an interesting title!

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.080
Put your ass where your heart wants to be!
— by Steven Pressfield.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.520
A very famous author.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.260
His most recent book.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.710
In this book, he talks about a Greek mythological
concept called Muses.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:12.130
These Muses are like Santa Claus, he says!

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.930
The Muses are nine different “angelic goddesses”…

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.030
From Greek mythology.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.090
The daughters of Zeus, the God of Gods.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:27.330
Each of them is supposed to come and sit on
your left shoulder and inspire you.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Art.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.330
Science.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.330
Speaking.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Music.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Dance.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.330
A goddess for each of the creative performing
arts.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:43.570
Only if their kind eye rests on you will be
able to flow — is the belief.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.590
Steven Pressfield says, these Muses, they
are actually floating around.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.710
At least that is how I would like to look
at them.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.710
Flying!

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.710
High up!

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.710
And, they see you.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.050
Your desire.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.590
Your need.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.630
And, they come, for a dive.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.650
They come closer, and they observe.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.000
It is okay if you miss the occasional off-day.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:21.910
But, they are looking for consistency, without
losing motivation and consistency and passion..

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.910
Do you turn up?

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.400
Do you keep attempting?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.660
Are you leaning forward?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.160
Are you taking risks?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.010
That is what they will observe, he says!

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.210
It is okay even if you screw up, but do you
take the first step with a “devil may care”

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.210
attitude?

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.370
That is what they will observe!

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.990
And, that is their trigger.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.650
Just like Santa Claus has a good-boys list
and a good-girls list, exactly like that,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.090
these Muses float around and alight on the
shoulders of people who take those calculated

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.100
risks, he says.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.870
So, put your ass where your heart wants to
be.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.449
It is not enough to desire something…

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:04.760
Get there!

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.400
MOVE there!

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.540
That is the message in that book!

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.440
Here is the third book of the day!

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.130
Steal like an Artist — by Austin Kleon.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.000
We have met him earlier.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.960
He comes up with a very unique concept called
Digitalisation.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:30.410
This world is hollering at the top of its
voice “Digitise, Digitise, Digitalise…”

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.360
but we forget something key along the way.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.169
When we say “Digitise, Digital”, we immediately
conjure up images of networks, dots, nodes,

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.070
zeroes, ones, floating neurons, connections…

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.850
but, that’s really not the case!

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.640
When you zoom out, I am telling you, THIS
is digital!

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.870
What?

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.110
Hand?

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.340
Fingers?

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.580
Yes!

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.180
If you go to the dictionary, and visit the
oxford languages website, and search for digit,

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.760
… where does that word come from?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.480
If you go digging you will notice that there
is an origin for this word in Latin.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.400
Digitus is the original word and it actually
means Finger.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400
Touch.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400
Feel.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400
Create.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.650
Use your hands and fingers.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:31.510
It seems Austin Kleon, a great artist, an
author, and a speaker also, he has two desks.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.669
He has an analog desk as well as a digital
desk.

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:36.669
Analog?

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.320
What does that mean?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.310
No computer, no electronic items, no digital
screens.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.430
Do.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.550
Try.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.800
With fingers.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.810
Get dirty.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.590
Tear stuff.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.590
Paint.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.260
Muddy up.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.040
And on the other side, there is a digital
screen.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.870
Why this difference?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.919
He comes up with a very beautiful reason for
that.

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:09.389
He says, “Thanks to undo!

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.580
Thanks to Grammarly perhaps!

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.960
Thanks to Photoshop!

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.300
Thanks to all these powerful tools.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.490
Nowadays, they also have AI injected into
them.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:30.270
Thanks to all these tools, you simply don’t
need to actually make mistakes..

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:36.630
You realise you are making a mistake very
soon, in fact, the computer corrects these

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.149
mistakes for you without even asking you these
days!

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:52.720
And so, that little little doll, that beautiful
little doll of an idea, before it takes its

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.240
first breath, we muffle it, we mummify it.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.110
We choke an idea, it becomes a stillborn baby,
because?

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.100
There is no scope for making mistakes and
following through.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.410
Where all does this mistake take us down its
random erroneous path?

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.410
Shall we see?

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.410
No options!

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:21.710
So, get away from the digital world, says
Austin Kleon, in this beautiful book.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.680
Go to the animal kingdom.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.810
This is a common scene.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:33.500
If you watch Discovery Channel, you will see
this hunt at least once a day!

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.560
That amazing gazelle, being chased by that
cheetah.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.880
Most of the times, the cheetah wins.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.529
In fact the cheetah has the highest kill percentage,
it seems.

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:52.089
If I were a lion, and I went for a hunt, only
one in six hunts ended up with a kill.

00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:53.089
The lion.

00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:54.380
But, the cheetah?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.380
One in two!

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.660
Fifty percent!

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:06.830
But, DID YOU KNOW, everytime the cheetah took
off, on that breathtaking chase, seventy miles

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:15.450
per hour it seems, top speed, but for how
long, just thirty seconds… for if it continues

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:21.730
past thirty seconds, its heart will explode
and it will die.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.000
So, if you think about it… look at the cheetah!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.370
To not die of starvation, it risks dying because
of the exertion of the hunt!

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.110
Be like the cheetah!

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.520
I saw another book too.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.180
The Upside of Uncertainty.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.380
Everybody will ask you this question.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.780
By default.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.339
What’s the worst that could happen?!

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:55.399
It is a good question, actually.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.399
Why?

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:03.910
Because, when you ask that question, you would
realise you are not fearing the act itself,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:10.240
but you are fearing what the others will say,
what the repercussions, what the fall out

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.110
after the half-done act might be!

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.550
You are not afraid of the act itself!

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:26.920
But it is all about side-effects and outside-world
commentary!

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.430
That is what we fear more!

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.670
So, when you start asking those questions,
why are you afraid, why aren’t you starting,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:39.440
why aren’t you taking that risk, and when
you will realise you are not actually fearing

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.709
that thing, you are fearing something else
associated, you may be attracted to take that

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:46.709
risk!

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:51.300
And, he asks us to ask ourselves another question
too!

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.470
Hey, What’s the BEST that could happen?

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.950
Weigh them!

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.880
Why be caught in a negative mindset obsessing
only about what’s the worst that could happen?

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.350
Why not see what’s the best that could happen
too?!

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.460
Alright, so, you have decided to take the
risk.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.700
Here are a few ideas to get started.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:18.990
The first one is from that famous blogger,
author, celebrity, Tim Ferriss.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.200
He calls it the Coffeehouse Challenge.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.490
Do you have a Starbucks nearby?

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.720
Or, an Only Coffee?

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.450
Or a Kumbakonam Degree Coffee outlet?

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.589
Head out there!

00:12:32.589 --> 00:12:35.040
Order your stuff.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.820
And… look at the person who is serving you
straight in the eye!

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.780
And ask for a ten percent discount.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.220
Tim Ferriss!

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.370
Not my idea!

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.830
What’s the reason?

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.451
Why is he suggesting something so odd?

00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:51.510
Go out on a limb.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.959
Be irrational.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.210
And get used to it.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:02.380
Because, when you enter the domain of risks,
you may have to do many things similar to

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.380
this!

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.670
Get used to this!

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.380
Stanford’s Design School folks propose something
like this.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.760
Do you remember this scene?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:14.950
From The Psycho movie — the Alfred Hitchcock
thriller movie.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.250
The famous shower scene.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.670
Why is she almost hysterical in this scene?

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.649
Why is her face twisted in tension?

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:29.220
Well, yes, there is a murderer just behind
the shower screen, with a knife.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.250
But, even that wouldn’t have been necessary.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.210
All you needed was to set the shower to hot
water, and mistakenly stand under the shower

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.480
when the cold water in the pipe hadn’t been
drained yet!

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.680
THAT is enough to contort your face like this!

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:51.220
So, the Stanford Design School uses this as
an example of what you can try at home!

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.390
Take a cold shower!

00:13:53.390 --> 00:14:01.260
If you are from a cold locality, you dread
that cold shower!

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.790
But, it is actually only those three or four
seconds.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.520
After that, cold water or hot water doesn’t
really matter for the body!

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.130
But, those three seconds…

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.310
Get over them!

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:23.440
The Stanford guys say, “Become comfortable
with being uncomfortable!”

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.310
Listen to that!

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.950
Become comfortable with being uncomfortable!

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.120
What a beautiful lesson!

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:41.000
If you look at this guy, I am thinking this
is the best way to actually go through that

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
act.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.850
Whatever you were dreading, whatever you were
wondering whether to start or not, this is

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.310
the right way..

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:53.500
Look at what he is doing.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.040
He is focusing on the process.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:02.880
There is that lady in front of him, spinning
in a wheel.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.300
She can’t even move.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.570
She shouldn’t move!

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:13.060
Because, this guy is blindfolded, and he is
going to throw throwing knifes at that lady,

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.350
and just miss!

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.480
Impalement art!

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.840
Think about this guy.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.580
Will he be able to open his blindfold to peek
at whether he is doing it right?

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.580
NO!

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.950
Will somebody be giving him feedback?

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.200
A little to the left, a little to the right?

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.200
No!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.610
The audience is shouting!

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.860
Some of them shout, “Oh my god, careful,
don’t hurt her!”

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.529
Probably some of them shout, “Yes!

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:39.120
Drive it straight into her!”

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.320
So, there is cacophony everywhere!

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.850
What is he focusing on?

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:50.320
He is not even getting feedback about how
he is doing, but he has to throw ten knives!

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.269
So, he is focusing only on the process!

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:57.010
What am I feeling when I throw this?

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.010
How does my hand move?

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:05.680
How does the knife make that sound, that whizzing
sound when it passes past my ear?

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.880
How is my hand after I have thrown?

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.270
How are my feet planted?

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.320
Have I moved them at all?

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.870
Focus on the process!

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:23.600
That is the best way to go through a risky
situation!

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.260
Take a violin, for instance.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.350
What is music?!

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:35.519
If the violin were doing nothing, it is just
a straight line.

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:37.380
A flat line.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:45.760
But, when a bow is played over it, ….. (Vivaldi
streaming…)

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.230
That is music!

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:53.160
This waveform teaches you something beautiful,
doesn’t it?

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.810
A climb.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.110
A fall.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.760
Loss.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.420
Profit.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.160
Some downs.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.120
Some ups.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.370
You cannot create music without them both!

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.050
Do you get me!

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:14.300
Anything you want to consider doing, there
is risk!

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:21.040
It is never a case where one of the options
has no risk, and the other is risk-laden.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.790
To do anything at all, is a risk.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:39.150
to not do anything at all, could be 
a bigger risk!

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:48.350
Thiruvalluvar, in the 461st Kural, says, beautifully:-
You are going to start something?

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.350
Fine!

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:54.110
Check first, what you are going to lose because
you do that.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:18:00.330
Then, check, what you may gain, because you
do that.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:06.590
And, after everything has settled down, what
is the income you are going to get, what is

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:12.580
the eventual benefit you are going to get,
look at that too.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:21.750
After analysing and weighing these three,
take the decision, and move on.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:27.470
We had this as our title:- What is the Biggest
Risk.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.030
Seth Godin answers that.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:36.640
He says, the biggest risk today is not taking
enough risks.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.140
So, that brings me to my Closing Thought.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:49.720
According to me, the biggest risk is a slightly
different message from what Seth Godin says..

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.440
The biggest risk, that double-edged sword,
“Should we / Shouldn’t we”.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:59.010
If we are on this side, “No, I didn’t
cross the road”.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:08.010
If we are on the other side, “Yes, I have
taken the risk, and I have crossed the road.”

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.970
But, guess what is the biggest risk?

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:19.940
To be caught halfway, between this side and
that side.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.780
The Buddhists often advice about following
The Middle Path.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.910
But, looks like they haven’t tasted the
wrath of the Chennai city traffic!

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:34.270
You cannot be two-minded, Once you have decided
to do something.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.400
Thiruvalluvar again.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.790
Ennitthuniga Karumam, Thunindhapin Ennuvam
Enbadhu Izhukku!

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:46.059
Once you have started, once you have set the
ball rolling, there is no looking back.

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:54.550
For, most of the disasters, most of the failures
that we read about, are because people did

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.070
not go through..

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.770
That missing follow through.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.600
Okay, you have decided on something?

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.600
Well, complete it!

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.600
See it through to the very end.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.910
Go all the way in.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.250
Only because people didn’t do that, there
have been all those failures.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:17.890
Alright, we will meet the day after tomorrow
again, thank you!

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:22.510
Namaste!
