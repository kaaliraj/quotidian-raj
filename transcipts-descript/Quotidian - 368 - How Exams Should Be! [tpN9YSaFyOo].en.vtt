00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.660
Some of you must have received this Whatsapp
forward titled "Why I hate mathematics".&nbsp;

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.130
This is what the student opines:-
While in class, this is what they want me

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.900
to do. Five plus Five is what. Okay, that
can be done.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.820
And then, they give me homework. They want
me to evaluate this complex expression. This

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.040
is doable too…
That is alright too.. While the classwork

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.420
and the homework are like this, how fair is
it to burden me with an exam like this..!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.140
"With two sheep flying, one yellow and the
other headed right, how much does a kilo of

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.239
cement cost, given that the cow is 10 years
old?"&nbsp;

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:01.860
Whaaaat? What is the problem with our exams,
and can they be structured in some other way?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.750
This is a topic that we may not be able to
do justice to, even spanning ten full Quotidians,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.850
but I am going to just touch a little about
it today.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:38.800
(Intro Music)
Namaste! This game, is called Zaxxon. My first

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.969
game. The first time I saw a computer, and
went "Aha", "Wow", "A Game? Playable on a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:02:00.700
computer?".. I lost badly too, pretty soon!
No lives. Just an infinite scroller. Getting

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:10.420
harder and harder. You just have to manoeuver
your plane through all those obstacles. That's

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:19.080
all. One chance. All depends on how well you
do.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.360
Games evolved after that. Some of you will
remember Dangerous Dave. This is Level One

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.630
of Dangerous Dave. You just have to go along
straight as an arrow, you climb, you lower

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.760
yourself, and open the door, and exit! And,
if you want, some diamonds to pick up along

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:46.510
the way. No trouble. Easy Peesy. How is Level
Two? How is Level Five? How is Level Ten?

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.950
A lot of monsters. A lot of timing. There
is a gun involved. There is a jetpack that

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:03.370
you will have to use judiciously. In a graded
level of difficulty, the Tenth is harder than

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:12.110
the First. Is it resembling school yet? Are
you able to draw some connections between

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:21.410
how education progresses exam after exam in
school and how Dangerous Dave progresses level

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:32.540
after level? The gameplay involved in this
pastime, is there something that we can take,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:42.100
we can borrow, from this world. Do you see
those three lives up above and to the right?

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:50.760
Two of them… are gone. One life..! Can we
give our students a second chance if they

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.600
lose the first time?
Games evolved even more. Some of you will

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.540
remember Wolfenstein 3D. That was probably
the first pseudo-3D game. In that game, yes,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.760
there were levels. But, within a level, there
were some spaces that were pretty hard to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.269
cross. Too many enemies that could pick you
off too easily. So, at strategically placed

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.390
hidden spots, (and I still don't get why a
prison should have medpacks hidden inside

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:33.010
it!) you would get medical first aid kits.
If you touched them, you would get healthier.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:44.700
How do we fashion suck medpacks in our school
curriculum? Can we let people who have injured

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.040
themselves get stronger without having to
restart the level?&nbsp;

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:00.020
And, while on the topic of "restarting a level",
I am reminded of even more evolved games.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:07.540
Here is one more called "Dark Souls". In this
game, there would be a huge level. The hero

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.630
would be exploring a huge cave. In a large
castle, the hero would be defeating all enemies

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.510
and proceeding fast. Here and there, there
would be bonfires. If he goes to the bonfire

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.910
and warms his hands there, it is called a
Save Point. You don't have to go through that

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.990
whole exploration again, if you have reached
that Save Point. The more Save Points there

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:46.650
are, the easier it is for the players. For
students, the more Save Points there can be,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.820
the easier will education be. Think about
that.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:02.240
Games evolved even more. There is a game called
God of War. In this epic game called God of

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:10.210
War, this hero is fighting the nearly undefeatable
monster blocking his path. There is no Save

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:20.840
Point there. There is no Med Pack. He will
fight, and if he is injured, he adopts one

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.980
important trick. It is called Life Regen.
He will just run away from the enemy. From

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:38.160
that battlefield area, he just has to move
away from the action a bit, and just given

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:47.531
the time, and space, our hero will regenerate
his power. He fights. He gets injured. He

00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:56.011
runs away from the battlefield. To survive.
To regen. To recoup. And comes back. What

00:06:56.011 --> 00:07:03.880
lesson can we take from here and incorporate
into our education system, into our examination

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.810
system?
This person's name is Carleton Washburne.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:17.690
In 1919, he came up with something called
the Winnetka Plan. An educationist. He was

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:24.340
the Principal of a school. And, he came up
with an idea. But, even a full hundred years

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.580
afterwards, his principles, amazing principles,
haven't been implemented anywhere. There are

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.300
facilities in place for it. The technology
is readily available. People have even proved

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.301
that it is a viable plan. But, somehow the
Winnetka Plan never got implemented. What

00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:49.930
is this Winnetka Plan?
He said, students can either be asked to finish

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:58.860
something by some time. Whatever mastery you
get, finish it by this time. What.. You have

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:07.490
scored 60 percent in Maths? Okay, 40 is the
cutoff. You've got 60. So, please go to the

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:13.510
next level. NOT FAIR. Why? This person might
have skipped probability or permutations and

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:20.550
combinations or statistics, and the next year,
statistics is going to be even more important.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:28.360
So,&nbsp;… basing it on a fixed time period,
and telling the student to achieve whatever

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.820
mastery they can in that allotted period and
keep running to the next one,&nbsp;.. a sort of

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:42.440
conveyor belt mechanism of education and examination
is wrong - says Washburne. He says, instead,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:52.750
given them flexi-time, but freeze on the mastery.
"You have to achieve hundred percent mastery

00:08:52.750 --> 00:09:00.400
on this subject. But, take as long as you
want." If he had proposed this in 1919, what

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.250
a foresightful genius he should have been?
But today, this is possible. With the smartphone

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:13.170
in your hand, with the ubiquitous internet,
with most classrooms already online because

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:22.210
of Covid, "take your time, achieve mastery!"
There is another twist to this thing. The

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:29.400
teacher gets to study not just the subject,
the teacher gets to study the student, and

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:37.600
customise the program per student. To suit
every student, in a way they will understand

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:46.660
it right, the program can be customised. That
was the Winnetka Plan. And that is my dream.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:54.190
I wish educational institutions adopt or probably
at least adapt this model.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:10:00.990
One of them has actually already done it.
Some of you may already know him. We have

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:09.210
seen him already. Sal Khan. Salman Khan. Not
the Bollywood actor Salman Khan, but the founder

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:17.320
of Khan Academy - Salman Khan. He says
knowledge itself is like a tree. Everything

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:25.339
connected to everything else. Each cascading
to further, deeper, broader, more fundamental

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:35.220
concepts. If you progress based on fixed time,
you will not have enough fundamentals for

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:42.330
you to build a proper structure, so give yourself
as much time as you want. That was the beginning

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:48.730
of the Flipped Classroom Approach. Give them
videos. Give them lectures. Let them watch

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:54.610
it as many times as they want. Let them watch
it in 2X speed. Let them watch it again and

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:02.310
again if they want. Let them come back and
in the classroom the teacher is not a sage

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.930
delivering lecture after lecture, the teacher
is a facilitator. Students sit around, question,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:20.190
debate, expand, what else can we do with the
subject, give the opportunity for such discussions.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:30.010
And, his tests, his examination methodology
follows two interesting approaches.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:37.290
One, some of you may already know, is the
Adaptive Testing approach. If you do very

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:45.870
well, the next level gets harder. Progressively
harder. Until you hit a blockade, and the

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:53.250
next level is lowered to suit you. Your current
level of difficulty, for a problem you have

00:11:53.250 --> 00:12:00.910
been given, is dependent on the previous four
or five questions that you have answered.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:08.520
Many international evaluations already use
the Adaptive Mode.&nbsp;

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:15.370
He also introduced one more concept called
Streaking. He said, "I am not going to say

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.210
you did something very well because you got
something right, or you did something very

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:27.310
badly because you didn't get one thing right.
No. I am going to look for streaks. If you

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:36.890
do ten problems, consecutively, ten graded
adaptive problems, correctly, then, you have

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.230
mastered (Winnetka), we can move to the next
level".&nbsp;

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:50.080
One of my favorites.. Perhaps even the all
time favourite App is called Elevate. It is

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:57.430
calling itself a Brain Trainer App. But, basically,
it is a vocabulary-building and mathematics - simple

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:06.810
maths, algebra, probably some number sense
training App. In this App, they have a system

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:17.839
called the EPQ. Elevate Proficiency Quotient.
That EPQ is across all these aspects. And,

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:27.290
at various levels. Whatever level you are
in, to move to the next level is harder progressively.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:32.029
If you are in the Beginner Mode, Beginner
to Intermediate may be an easy move. But,

00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:37.490
if you are in the Advanced Mode, to move from
Advanced to Expert will be harder. If you

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:42.430
make one mistake, they will forgive you. If
you consecutively make two or three mistakes,

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:49.149
they won't punish you, they will help you,
by lowering your level. Do some research on

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:54.620
this. Really wonderful, beautiful, graded,&nbsp;..
it would almost seem as if there is some complex

00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:00.980
Machine Learning going on inside the App all
the time.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.660
What should we look for? If we are going to
conduct an evaluation,&nbsp;.. should we expect

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.220
them to remember everything we have taught
them… that's not what we should look for.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.110
Instead, can we look for these things.. Can
we look for what they have learned? Can we

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:23.420
look for whether they are able to think critically?
See how their responses are? Can we see whether

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:29.650
they can come up with new responses that they
haven't been trained for? That creating..

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:35.140
can we look for that? Is there an emotional
quotient also involved that we can evaluate?

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:41.709
Also, how well can they work with others?
It is not about competition in the real world..

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:47.980
Can they work with others. And finally, can
they lead others? Can they inspire?&nbsp;

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:55.630
How are we going to track all these things
in an exam? If we can find methodologies that

00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:04.930
will evaluate these, only then probably, exams
will become relevant. And… if we don't evaluate

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:12.330
for these, we will be stuck with situations
like this one. Just a year ago, IIT Delhi

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.300
came out with an advertisement like this.
They are looking for a Dog Handler, and they

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:29.430
want a B.Tech or equivalent undergraduate
degree.. Seriously?! A B.Tech undergraduate

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:39.750
degree for a dog handler? If things shouldn't
deteriorate to this, please, please, examine

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:47.399
your exams! Thank you!
And, yes, we will meet tomorrow! Bye Bye!
