00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.360
Republic of Congo.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.929
In the middle of Africa.

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.110
A word from the people of Congo.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.110
Ilunga!

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.940
And, what does “ilunga” mean?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.119
It seems it characterises or represents a
person.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.800
What kind of person?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:32.750
Ready to forgive the first time he receives
or she receives any abuse.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.750
Second time?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.520
They will tolerate it.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.489
And, the third time?

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.489
Never!

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:50.600
A person like this, a characteristic, a personality,
all conveyed in a single word.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.620
It seems, on a survey conducted on thousands
of linguists, they rated this word, according

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.890
to the BBC News, they rated this word as the
most difficult word to translate.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.509
Of course, if there is such an expansive backstory
for a single word, of course!

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:22.590
Acknowledgement is probably the most important
thing in any conversation and any issue resolution.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.759
That is what we are covering today!

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.210
Namaste!

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.020
I am present, sir!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.280
Four hundred and forty seven.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.750
Watch this movie scene.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.480
This is from a movie that represents Churchill.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.689
His life history.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.829
Particularly, his last few years.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.719
The Darkest Hour.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:25.810
“Will you stop interrupting me while I am
interrupting you?!”

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.010
— That was Churchill.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.330
Churchill could say that.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.630
But, not everybody else, every THING else!

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.650
This book talks about that problem, quite
extensively.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.700
The Computer Science of Human Decisions.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.700
Algorithms to Live By.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.080
Algorithms that will be useful for our day
to day lives.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.980
These are originally conceived to run software
optimally on computers, but you can use them

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.750
in daily life.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.650
One such algorithm is about network traffic
and congestion.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.790
Long ago, when the Internet was just being
born, even before it was CALLED the Internet,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.510
it was called AlohaNET.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.720
Some scientists in Hawaii wanted to have reliable
communication between the 137 islands of Hawaii.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.330
They used radio at that time.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.410
And, as long as it was just one transmitter
and one listener, all was well.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.439
But, when both of them started transmitting
at the same time, all was HELL!

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.400
Because, I hardly ever listen when I am myself
speaking!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.629
If you want me to listen to you while you
speak, I must NOT BE talking in the first

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.629
place!

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.760
What if there are more than two people speaking?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.939
All HELL breaks loose.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.650
So, how do we handle this?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.329
I don’t know if you are going to start talking.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.610
I am talking now..

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.959
I am about to start talking, but I have to
check if you are in listening mode.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.080
How do I do that?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.790
Do you remember the comedy scenes in movies,
where two people on a staircase, both of them

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.120
will move to the left side of the stairs,
and then both of them will move to the right…

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.450
Or, on a video call, a person starts talking,
but then, one person says “You go first”

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.830
while the other quips at the same time, “You
go first, sorry for the interruption, you

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.830
go first!”

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.110
How do you resolve this congestion?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.400
For the past 45, 50 years, the internet is
being driven by this single beautiful algorithm

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.050
designed so long ago, in AlohaNet.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.789
They called it, Exponential Backoff.

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.229
I try something.

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.770
You try the same thing at the same time.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.259
We both realise that there is collision.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.540
Instantly, I backoff.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.419
And then wait.

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.450
How do I wait?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.620
I toss a coin and wait.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.340
How long do I wait?

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.009
First time, I wait one second, or one millisecond,
and the next time I have to, I wait two!

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.169
I wait four then!

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.090
Exponentially I increase my backoff time,
while tossing a coin.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:32.620
And, that is enough for a credit card purchase
to happen in Amazon today, for a video call

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.539
to go through perfectly today, for a YouTube
video, including Quotidians, to be streamed

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:45.389
beautifully to your mobile device today, all
congestion taken care of, by this simple,

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.910
beautiful algorithm called Exponential Backoff.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.330
A congestion, the same thing is tried by two
different people at the same time.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.570
More than two people try..

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.639
How to backoff?!

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.810
They called it The Algorithm of Forgiveness.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.229
To forgive…

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.770
To give yet another chance…

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.240
A way to do that.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.740
You must have seen this..

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.300
In fact, it might have happened in your own
life too.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.410
You call for a get-together party.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.330
And, there are these guys, these girls.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.480
They will come for NO SUCH THING.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.800
And, what happens typically?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.900
You guys get together, and you stop sending
that invitation to that person.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.580
Instead, the book recommends, do not ever
stop!

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:48.500
When your browser tries to access a web page,
it never stops trying, did you notice?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.850
It tries..

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:57.650
And then tries five seconds later, and then
tries twenty-five seconds later, exponential

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.680
backoff.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:10.389
You try your ATM number, and assuming it fails
four times, the next attempt is one hour later,

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.860
if you fail again, the next attempt is only
possible two hours later, and if you fail

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.340
again, the next attempt is allowed only four
hours later.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.340
Exponential Backoff.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.740
Never say “Sorry, you will never be allowed
inside again!”

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.470
But, exponential backoff.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.470
Punishment increases.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.310
But, it is never lethal.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.080
That “Finite Patience and Infinite Mercy”
combination.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.060
That is what is needed.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:45.000
If there was a member in your family, addicted
to drugs or drinks, and you try your best

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.509
to reform them, … and they get better slowly.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.830
And then, suddenly, one fine day, they drop
off..

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.930
What?

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.060
You get angry?

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.669
Send them out of the house?

00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:56.669
NO!

00:07:56.669 --> 00:08:00.800
Give them an exponential backoff, once more.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.819
How do you do that?

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:07.430
Have you been abstaining from all this for
ONE DAY?

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.750
Very good.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.750
Ouch..

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:16.539
You abstained on the second day too, but slipped
and fell on the third day?

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.849
I am going to backoff.

00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:23.000
I am not going to accept one day any more.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.639
I am going to want one week!

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.960
Abstain for one full week..

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.060
You didn’t do that well either?

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:36.990
Okay, next time, you need to come back after
a month’s cool off period.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.479
So, the punishment increases.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:41.490
The opposite could also be done.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.490
One month..

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.590
Unable to do it?

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.910
Well, do at least one week.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.880
Isn’t this the classic story from the Mahabharatha?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.380
Give us our country back.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.880
Give at least five districts.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.080
Five villages at least.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.100
Space equivalent to the head of a pin…!

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.770
Do you remember?

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.560
Exponential backoff.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.540
You give a person some money.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.940
And they spend it well, they come back, give
you a proper account.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.810
You give that person some more money.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.000
Trust grows.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.240
And, you give that person some more money.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.080
And, trust grows even more.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.130
Additive Increase.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:29.170
Instead of going up rapidly in “multiplied
factors”, increase it slowly, gradually,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.130
in a measured manner.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:37.089
But, one fine day, they come to you and say
they have lost it, they are not able to account

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:44.870
properly for it, they seem to have cheated
you, what happens instantaneously?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.040
You cut their allowance by half!

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.320
That is the equivalent of Multiplicative Decrease.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.850
Additive — we went up in tens of rupees..

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.620
One thousand rupees, One thousand and ten
rupees, One thousand twenty rupees..

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:12.320
But, when there is a hint of cheating, break
of / breach of trust, 1000 becomes 500.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.980
500 becomes 250.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.350
Additive Increase.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.750
Multiplicative Decrease.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.240
These are the two keywords!

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.270
Exponential Backoff.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.830
And, AIMD.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.860
Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.950
These two are the algorithms that run the
internet today.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.990
TCP — you must have heard of this protocol.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.630
These are the two fundamental pillars of TCP.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.459
Go look it up.

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:46.610
This book — The 12 Rules for Life — he
even calls it an antidote for chaos.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.519
Jordan Peterson, in this book, refers to a
little book, inside this book.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:55.930
That is the book we are going to ruffle through
fast.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.860
It is possible, because, it is a book for
four-year-olds.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:06.270
It is a little picture-book, called “There’s
no such thing as a Dragon”.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.120
Acknowledgement is important.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.230
Are you going to talk too?

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.450
I have understood that, and I am going to
change my behaviour.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.850
Are you going to cheat?

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.720
Well, I have understood that, and I am going
to change my behaviour.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.089
Wasn’t that what we saw all this while?

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:24.880
See what happens in this story.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.930
One fine morning, the boy gets up.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.480
He sees a cat-like creature on the bed.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.570
Looks like a Dragon.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:40.760
Goes to his Mom after patting this Dragon,
and says, “Mom, there is a Dragon on my

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.779
bed!” and Mom says, “There is no such
thing as a Dragon!

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:48.880
Keep quiet!”

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.459
This boy goes along with his work, and the
Dragon tries to help him.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:57.579
Tries to involve itself in the boy’s day-to-day
life.

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:01.310
But, the boy ignores the Dragon.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.310
Why?

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:07.769
Mom has said there is no such thing as a Dragon
and what is the point giving attention to

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.620
something which is “no such thing!”

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.790
So, he ignores it.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.810
And the Dragon grows!

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:21.080
It becomes as large as a dog, that morning.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:28.579
Mom gives food, dosas, pancakes, and the Dragon
starts eating everything.

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:34.180
This boy gets just one pancake from that pile
of pancakes.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.630
Boy ignores.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.199
Mom ignores.

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:40.400
The Dragon grows.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.769
It becomes as large as the room now.

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:45.690
Mom continues to turn a blind eye.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.220
Continues to do the household work.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.220
Cleans the floor.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:54.710
Moves from room to room through the windows,
as the doors are all blocked up by the Dragon.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.870
But she still somehow manages it.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.350
Ignoring the growing Dragon.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.540
The Dragon becomes as large as the house.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.670
Still, ignored.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.940
A bread-van passes by.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.380
Perhaps the Dragon loves bread.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:25.310
It gets up, gives chase, and like the shell
on the back of a snail, the house starts moving.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.310
The house is gone!

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.310
Dad comes back from work, looks for the house…

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.899
The next door neighbour says, “The house
is gone..

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:35.730
A Dragon…”

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.079
The Dad panics.

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:46.300
And, far away, there is this boy, his Mom,
all stuck up in the house, on the back of

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.300
a Dragon.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.100
He goes near, asks, “What happened, how
did this all happen?!”

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.950
He enters the house too.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:04.139
And, the boy says, “Dad, There IS such a
thing as a Dragon, Dad.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:09.009
Look at this, touch it!”

00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:12.209
Magic happens at that moment.

00:14:12.209 --> 00:14:20.560
The Dragon … multiplicative decrease — the
Dragon becomes as small as a dog..

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.509
as small as a kitten.

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:25.449
Friendly, playful.

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:27.940
It had always been friendly and playful.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:36.660
Mom says, “I wouldn’t mind a Dragon that
is as small as a kitten” — and thus ends

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.130
the story.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:45.310
The boy says, “Mom, I think it just wanted
to be noticed..!”

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:50.030
Do you get the connection?

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.079
Four-year-olds perhaps loved this story.

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:58.139
But, even for forty-year-olds, there is a
nice message hidden there.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:03.990
Because, some problems in our lives, they
want to be acknowledged.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:11.360
They want to be noticed, and if you don’t
address them when they are small, they will

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.529
grow so large that you cannot address them
any more.

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:25.089
So, learn Exponential Backoff, and Additive
Increase, Multiplicative Decrease.

00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:27.990
Use them appropriately in your lives.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:34.680
As a closing thought, I had to end up thinking
quite contrarily.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:44.050
For, I remember, from my childhood, a fairy-tale
story that I read called, “The Boy Who Knew

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.810
No Fear”.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:55.170
The other name for the book was, “The Boy
Who Left Home To Find Out About The Shivers”.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:00.910
Nobody showed me what fear was in my hometown,
and so, I am trying to travel the countryside,

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:08.230
perhaps spend time in this so-called Haunted
Castle for three nights, and learn what Fear

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.569
really is..

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:10.769
Interesting story..

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:17.440
The essence of it is, you need Creative Imagination,
you need a little Intelligence, to be even

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.329
afraid of anything..!

00:16:21.329 --> 00:16:27.010
But the essence there is, if you don’t acknowledge
something..

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:36.130
“I am Fear” claims a foreboding being,
with horns on its head and an arrow-tail,

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:41.650
and a pitchfork in hand, red smoke puffing
from his nostrils, and stands in front of

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.650
you..

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.610
If you say, “Hi there, how do you do!”,
if you don’t acknowledge that person as

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:52.449
The Devil himself, they lose power..

00:16:52.449 --> 00:16:53.449
This is the counter-thought?

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:56.890
If we don’t acknowledge, will they grow?

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:57.910
Keep growing?

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:04.420
Or, if we don’t acknowledge, like in the
case of this boy, ineffectively, will it become

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:10.890
a dummy piece?

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.299
What is your opinion?

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:13.750
Share in the comments..

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:21.360
Let us meet again, soon.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.410
Thank you!
