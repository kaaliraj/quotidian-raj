00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.250
They usually call these “Systems”..

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.410
How important are they?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.500
Whatever you want to achieve, whatever your
goals, to reach them, the importance of systems..

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.760
I saw a beautiful visual and quote, recently,
that conveyed the importance wonderfully.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.019
So, it compares this… “trampoline attempt”
trying to reach the goal..

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.650
This is a BAD system.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.430
It compares that.. with THIS system.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.840
A GOOD system.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.840
A ladder.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.129
An appropriately tall ladder.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.399
A well-balanced ladder.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.070
You can keep getting closer and closer to
the goal.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.250
A GOOD system.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.890
The author, we know him well already, James
Clear, says:- “You don’t rise to the level

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.430
of your goals.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430
You fall..

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.890
You stay..

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.140
At the level of your systems..”

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.650
So, instead of aiming at something, and chasing
towards it.., have a SYSTEM, and focus on

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.130
elevating your system..

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:24.450
That should be your focus.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.490
Interesting, is it not?!

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.759
Namaste!

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.720
Four hundred and fifty-five is about “Layering”
Goals.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.720
And..

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.750
instead of looking at like this, as stacked
steps.., it might be more relevant to look

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.880
at it like this.. onion-skin fashion.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.290
There is a core goal.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.180
But what additional layers can I apply over
it so that the probability of achieving it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.180
increases.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.939
I am quite sure many of you remember Quotidian
433.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.039
We encountered this story!

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:15.090
“And, just when the king was about to down
that potion in a gulp, the minister intervened

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.530
and said, “Just a minute, your Majesty.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.510
You need to also know where this potion is
coming from..!​ ​So, this is the white

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.180
mandrill from deep in the jungles of Africa.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.450
We have concocted this potion by taking teardrops
from its eyes, mucus from its nostrils, and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.629
saliva from its fangs and combining them on
a full moon night.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:47.290
Just don’t try to remember where this is
coming from.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.349
You may be able to drink it only then!!”

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.599
And, this story is used typically, to talk
about the memory..

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:08.680
the HOOK of the memory.. and how some things
can be very hard to UNREMEMBER.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.810
And I thought, the story ended there.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:21.610
But, recently, I came across something else,
which seemed to be a very nice antidote to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.159
this threat.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:36.040
The author of that article says, “If you
are caught in such an impasse.., there is

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.350
something else you can do to counter..

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.490
Like fighting fire with fire..

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.750
Oh, the Congo Mandrill??

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.110
No problem.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.480
Consider this.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480
Careful.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.659
It might psyche you out.. this snake.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.959
I will show it to you, if you are ready.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.850
Are you ready??

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.850
Okay!

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.850
THIS!!

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.430
This is the TWO-HEADED ALBINO ANACONDA!!

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.850
Two heads!

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.480
No skin pigmentation!

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.690
Anaconda!

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:24.370
I am sure you have forgotten that monkey!!

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.710
That is the antidote.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:37.570
If you are distracted by something, identify,
invent, concoct, something even more interesting

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.770
that the other hook falls off!

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.550
How about that!

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.530
Anyway, we were talking about goal setting.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:54.030
And, let us briefly look at why goals are
so hard to achieve..

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.380
Consider the plight of this man.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.180
I really don’t know whether to call that
a “plight”!

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.860
This is Usain Bolt.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.500
The one and only!

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.340
2008, 2012, 2016!

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.729
Hundred metres, Two hundred metres, Four hundred
metres..

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.780
Gold Gold Gold, Gold Gold Gold, Gold Gold
….. Gold.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.740
(But, was stripped from him because somebody
else had been caught using drugs..).

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.590
But, nine golds!

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.330
Across 12 years.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.570
Champion of Champions.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.140
But, did you know this little tidbit about
him??

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.220
Five minutes and thirty seconds is all that
he has run.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.590
Just five and a half minutes.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.320
His overall Olympic running..

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.360
across twelve years, is five-and-a-half minutes.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:58.650
It is five-and-a-half minutes since I started
talking in this video!

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.810
How does one set a goal?

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.229
The Olympics calendar has been announced..

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.720
The date and time of the Olympics 100 metres
finals has been declared.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.780
The morning of that fateful day, ten seconds.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.840
Everything will be decided.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.830
How do I set a goal for something like that??

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.310
That is the plight of people like him.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.470
That is the plight of all of us, when you
set a goal.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.600
But.. if there is a goal, what CAN it do to
you?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.590
Why do we even have a goal?

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.360
By reaching that goal, is it just the goal
that we attain?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.700
Or, are there other benefits?!

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.000
Here are three..

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.300
The first thing is you have a sense of achievement.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.050
You summit Mount Everest, and you are on top
of the world.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.880
Peaked!

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.340
Everybody else is below you.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.900
A sense of achievement.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.439
It will boost your ego too!

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:09.560
The second advantage or benefit in any kind
of goal-setting is you get to focus your time

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.900
and energy..

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.720
You get to channelise them.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.789
We get up every day..

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:15.610
We float around in the current every day.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.250
And, we curl up in bed at the end of every
day.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.820
Instead of whiling our life away like this,
something that motivates us..

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:31.120
And, finally, great amounts of learning and
beautiful opportunities to grow..

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:39.639
If getting a driving license were our goal..,
do we end up just getting the driving license?

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.470
We get new confidence.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.629
You become alert about the environment.

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:47.870
You observe other cars differently.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.370
Till today, you had been observing them as
a pedestrian.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.570
Now, you observe a car differently.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.250
You learn a new perspective about the things
around you.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.220
That is what a simple thing like a driving
license can give you.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.520
So.., don’t come at me with, “Why do I
need a goal in the first place?!”

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.520
It helps!

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.449
So, we are going to see four layers..

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:21.370
To attain a goal, can there be phases.. layers..

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.590
The first layer is called the CRAZY Layer.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.870
What is the CRAZY Layer?

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.900
Consider the Boeing.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:44.219
Boeing, during the 1930s, 1940s, they were
bomb-carrying vessels for the American Air

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:45.219
Force.

00:08:45.219 --> 00:08:49.760
It would carry bombs, and drop them among
the enemy’s territory.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.480
Such a company..

00:08:52.480 --> 00:09:00.690
when the World War ended, it seems it went
through.. these days we talk about layoffs..

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.810
five percent of our employees will be laid
off.. ten percent..

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.890
consider these numbers.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:12.100
There were 51,000 employees at Boeing at that
time.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.850
They slashed it TO, not by!!, to 7500!

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:23.760
Imagine 51,000 employees in a company suddenly
becoming 7500 employees!

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.440
That’s what happened to Boeing.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.440
Somebody had an idea..

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.140
Let us build a jet airliner.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.579
A jet-engine powered passenger-carrying vehicle.

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:39.470
“The idea is good.. yes.. but we don’t
have the experience!

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.149
All that we have carried till now.., they
have just been bombs!

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:47.490
Air Force has been our only customer all these
years!

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:55.399
And, all our competitors are saying propeller-driven
airplanes will be the future..

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.870
Not jets!

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:03.320
And, guess what the budget for that is??

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.820
Whatever profit we have made in the past five
years, four times that much money we will

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.380
have to pump into this just to get a prototype
done!”

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:19.480
And, at that moment, the Boeing management
said, “Go ahead..

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.450
Let’s have a crazy goal.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.380
An audacious goal.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.410
BeeHAG.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.440
Remember?

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.490
Big Hairy Audacious Goal.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.490
Go ahead.”

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.230
Remember the attempt to send a rocket to the
moon?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.709
Putting a man on the moon?!

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:36.149
A big, hairy, audacious goal.

00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:38.750
A CRAZY goal.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.600
Take this goal, for example.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.130
I want to create software..

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:54.430
probably artificially intelligent, computer-vision-based
software, that will track the video of a game,

00:10:54.430 --> 00:11:00.080
that will identify individual players, split
them into teams, and keep score.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.020
That is my dream goal.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.370
Is it even possible??

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.519
Sounds crazy..

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:07.750
outlandish..

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.780
far beyond reach..

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.780
BeeHAG!

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:16.660
The problem with such goals is.. you can’t
say, Monday I will do laundry, Tuesday I will

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.709
go to the office, and Wednesday I will have
the software ready..

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:25.290
That is not how a crazy goal works..

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.839
In fact, there is even a Keyword Question
for it.

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:30.550
Look at this question.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:36.589
“Wouldn’t it be simply unbelievably amazing
if…”

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:39.130
That is a crazy goal.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.130
Can you do that?

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:45.170
When you fill that blank in… how do you
feel…?

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:52.579
If you get that amazing feeling, if you feel
that only in such a sentence you can place

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:55.639
that goal, that is your Crazy Goal.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:59.089
So, set a goal like that.

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:01.380
That is the CRAZY layer.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.700
The second layer is the CONCRETE Layer.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:09.870
This has been laid out in many different ways
by many different people.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.449
One important and popular version of that
is the SMART Goals chart.

00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:15.449
Specific.

00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:16.449
Measurable.

00:12:16.449 --> 00:12:17.449
Achievable.

00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:18.449
Relevant.

00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:19.449
Timed.

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:20.449
If you want to achieve something, lay it down
specifically.

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:21.449
Make it measurable.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:22.540
What is needed.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.399
When is it needed.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:26.260
How should it look.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.520
Define it.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:36.440
And, this is the time when you start moving
away from your eventual goal, that destination,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.870
and start moving towards your process.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.709
How do you measure?

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:43.459
What do you measure?

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:47.630
When do you see that there is progress happening?

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.800
Answers for these questions…

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.340
What is the Keyword Question for this?

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:59.399
How would I know when I’ve achieved my crazy
goal?

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:03.160
That is when you have a CONCRETE Layer in
place.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160
Crazy.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160
Concrete.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.529
But, then, is everything under your control?

00:13:09.529 --> 00:13:11.900
Yes, that is the third layer.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.420
The CONTROL Layer.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.140
“I need to train daily!”

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.579
Okay, but what if it is raining..?

00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:19.900
You can’t play basketball..

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.270
You may perhaps be able to swim.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.589
But you can’t play basketball..

00:13:24.589 --> 00:13:29.410
What are the things in your control?

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:35.330
That “Will it make the boat go faster”
book?

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.330
Remember?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:45.270
Everything in that book, all the strategies
that they describe is driven by that one question.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:50.230
Every time you reach a dilemma point, “Should
I?”, “Shouldn’t I?”

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:57.240
— Whenever you face those questions, you
tell yourself, “Yes, I have taken this decision

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:03.990
because a dotted line from the final goal
that I wanted to reach.. that crazy goal..

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.750
This is in my control”.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.750
We will probably ignore things that are beyond
our control.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:19.269
But, we WILL do everything within our control
to move a little closer to our destination.

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:26.170
So, here, the Keyword Question is, “What
is inside our control?”

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.970
And, “What can we do to drive towards our
crazy goal?

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.519
How do we turn towards it?

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:38.170
(Sometimes, we are distracted, so we need
to turn towards the goal..) and how do we

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.370
move faster towards it?

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:44.389
(Sometimes, you are slowed down, so we need
to speed up in your movement towards the goal..)

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:49.250
When we talk about velocity, it involves both
direction and magnitude..

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.550
Aiming both of those towards the goal.. for
which we need Control.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.180
That is the CONTROL Layer.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.990
What measures, what checks and balances, can
you put in place, that are within your scope

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.370
of control.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.589
Fine.

00:15:03.589 --> 00:15:05.910
What’s the fourth layer?

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.310
The last one..

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.579
The fourth layer is the EVERYDAY Layer..

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:19.010
In the EVERYDAY Layer, you probably lose sight
of the eventual goal because it has been atomised..

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.060
Remember this book?

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:31.089
It has been atomised into decisions you take,
habits you grow, milestones you create, one

00:15:31.089 --> 00:15:32.089
day at a time..

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:33.089
You have pulverised it..

00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:39.329
There is that old saw about a pygmy being
asked “How do you eat an elephant?”

00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:43.800
That person is shorter than the kneecap of
the elephant..

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:51.610
And he quips, “I don’t eat an elephant.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.310
I eat elephant cutlets.”

00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:02.430
So, I never scope out the whole goal, it is
all in bits and pieces, and I take it one

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.519
at a time..

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:04.770
So, how do you atomise?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.220
That is the fourth layer.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:14.170
The Keyword Question there is, “What can
I do TODAY?”

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.110
Want to climb Mount Everest?

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.820
What can I do today?

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.010
Instead of taking the elevator up, can I climb
the stairs?

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.779
That is an EVERYDAY Layer.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:29.259
And, by the way, let us not forget this lady.

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:30.980
I don’t know who she is.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.300
I just picked it off randomly from the web.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.060
But, I am sure there is a story.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.620
Look at all the other people she has left
behind..

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.329
She is running a marathon.

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:44.410
In Mumbai.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:45.410
Look at her.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.570
Wearing shoes and a saree.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.100
I am quite sure she is running for a cause.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.870
She may even win this..

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.380
She may come ahead of all those other people
there.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.569
Because they are running for medals and certificates.

00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:08.870
But, this woman is probably running to raise
funds for a cancer patient perhaps.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:15.160
Or, to make a point about women empowerment
perhaps.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.799
She has a better WHY.

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:21.910
Don’t forget that.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:27.720
We talked about the four layers.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.150
What was that again?

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.150
Crazy.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.150
Concrete.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.150
Control.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.150
Everyday.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.150
C.C.C.E..?

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.150
So hard to remember.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.400
Can’t you give us something to remember
it easily with, I hear you ask.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.340
I tried mnemonics of various kinds.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.340
Nothing worked.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.090
So, I went to Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.140
He had drawn the Vitruvian Man.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.350
You can easily remember him, can’t you?

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.929
So, let me help you remember these four layers
using this famous piece of art.

00:17:52.929 --> 00:18:00.740
Because, the first layer is crazy, and all
craziness resides here, in the brain.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.740
Loony.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.740
Crazy.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.120
Go down gradually from there..

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.610
The second layer is Concrete.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.880
The measurement layer.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.760
You can measure with your eyes.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.679
Taste with your tongue.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.600
Smell with your nose.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.519
Hear with your ears.

00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:24.159
Most measurements happen using these organs.

00:18:24.159 --> 00:18:28.720
That’s your CONCRETE Layer.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.640
And then, what’s in our hands?

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640
What can we do?

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.230
That is the hand.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.450
And, from the hand, comes the CONTROL.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.659
The third layer.

00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:43.960
And, finally, remember the old saying in English?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.650
“Put in the hard yards”..

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.499
You have to work hard..

00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:51.030
You have to walk the talk.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.230
You can’t just indulge in empty talk.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.940
That is represented by the Legs.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.030
You have to walk the hard yards.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.180
Put in the hard yards.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.470
Every day.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.610
Crazy.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.760
Concrete.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.900
Control.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.050
Everyday.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.770
What goal are YOU going to set?

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.200
I am going to be on the lookout.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:28.220
We will meet soon, on the 16th of this month.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.780
Thank you!
