00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.430
Betty Crocker is a cake mix brand.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.840
And they can actually include dried eggs.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.960
“You don’t need to add eggs either, for
we have added dried powdered egg for you in

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.960
it already!”

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.039
they could have proclaimed.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.320
But it seems, users wanted to do something.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:36.530
Some kind of creativity, some kind of hands-on,
I need to do, and only then I can claim this

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.940
cake-mix-cake to be something I created by
myself!

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.640
And, that is why, even though they could have,
they didn’t..

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
They said, just add eggs!

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:03.050
Interesting, is it not?

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.450
Namaste!

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.590
Four hundred and thirty nine!

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.720
Hidden Complexity!

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.850
Is there..

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.049
But ain’t there!

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.250
What is complexity?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.250
Complexity is multiple things at the same
time.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.579
Too many new things.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.500
Something that is presented to me without
a match with a mental model that I already

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
have.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.820
Something similar to what I already know..
making only a slight change to it.. provide

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.970
me with a map..

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.219
I don’t think anything will be complex.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.219
Look at this joke!

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:57.090
“Tell me what you are good at?” asks the
interviewer.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.300
The person answers with, “I can copy paste
and browse for something with patience!”

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:11.360
“That’s it then, You are hired!” says
the interviewer!

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.630
This appeared in the Cyanide and Happiness
cartoon strip.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.940
What’s the job interview for?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.480
Yes, it is a software developer interview.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:32.290
Even if it sounds mocking and ridiculous,
deep down, every software engineer will agree,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:42.019
every designer will agree too, the copy and
paste is probably sixty percent of their work.

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.650
They copy from somewhere else, they copy from
their own stuff, all the time!

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.629
No wonder then, this person deserves all the
respect he can get.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:00.250
He has worked in Xerox, Amazon, Apple, and
Yahoo! Larry Tesler is his name.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.580
The Father of Copy/Paste.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.790
The person who gave birth to the CONCEPT.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.209
Any idea how complicated this thing actually
is?

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.159
If you are copy pasting a file, the file clones
itself and relocates.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.610
If a text is copied and pasted, the content
of the text is reproduced at the new cursor

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.610
insertion point.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.349
If a part of an image is copied and pasted,
those pixels get re-painted in the same sequence

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.819
in the new location.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.939
Infinitely powerful.

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:46.000
But, hiding under a very silly simple Control-C
Control-V, Command-C Command-V. Perhaps because

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.200
he was thinking about this all the time, he
came up with a law which has now become Tesler’s

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200
Law.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.280
What does it say?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.769
There is a concept called the conservation
of complexity.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:18.940
Whatever system you design, whatever software
you design, there is a basic amount of complexity

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.280
that you can’t do away with.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.669
Either this complexity has to be encountered
while developing the product, faced, thought

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.030
about, refactored, broken up, made easier.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.979
OR, if the product designer has done it in
a simple manner, the user, on the other side,

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.320
that person will suffer because of the complexity.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:53.210
A developer may work for a week and solve
a problem for millions of users who will save

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.260
one minute of their time, a million minutes..
but if that effort had not been put on that

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.570
side (the developer’s side), in this side
(the user’s side) the effort would have

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.590
had to be put again and again and again!

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.290
The Law of Conservation of Inherent Complexity!

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:25.080
So, to face complexity, to hide it, to transcend
it and succeed in bringing users into their

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.050
‘product’, around the world I am picking
four examples, four interesting examples that

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.880
I encountered.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.860
You share what you find!

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.080
Number One is Hiding Complexity.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.210
I was really shocked when I came to know about
this.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.080
Apple’s recent iOS.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.970
Iphone Operating System release.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.690
Very recently they have launched a feature.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.780
Pretty powerful feature.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.780
A feature so many of us would want..

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.270
But they didn’t tell anybody.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.289
Go, find out for yourself.

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.430
When you stumble upon it, goosebump moments
galore!

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.430
Wow!

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.510
This afternoon, I tested it with two very
frequent phone users.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.310
I asked them “Did you know!”

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.190
They said, “No!”

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.509
And then, when they explored and discovered
that feature, “Wow!”

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.020
What’s that feature?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.020
This!

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:44.310
“In iOS 16, you could click on a photo and
then remove the person or the subject from

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:52.870
the background just like this and save it
or send it to anyone!”

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.120
Just like that!

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.660
Background removal in the Photos App.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.669
Did you know!?

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.360
So, this is one way, hide the complexity.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.289
People really interested in learning about
this, will stumble upon it, and learn it.

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.110
But, make it simple for everybody else.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.250
This “make it simple for everybody else”
takes us to Number Two.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:24.389
Number Two is “Make it simple for everybody
else, Make It Complicated for those who need

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:25.389
it.”

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.160
There is this piece of software called the
Chrome browser.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.180
I am sure you have heard of it.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:38.550
If you want to look at the Developer Console,
you just go to View, and down there, you see,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.699
the Developer Options.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:49.870
Chrome tells you, I actually help developers
do their work better.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:57.630
But, this same feature, if you search for
it in Safari, you are not likely to spot it.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:03.690
So, we may think, Safari probably is not a
developer-friendly browser.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.810
Actually, no!

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.830
Do you know what you have to do?

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:16.520
In Safari, there is a Settings — Preferences
Pane where you have to turn it on, like that.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.520
Show develop menu in the menu bar.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.120
If you do that, then, look at that!

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.280
Up there, you see a Develop item in the top
menu!

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.029
And, more options!

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:38.289
It is actually more developer-friendly than
Chrome itself!

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:45.410
So, if there are hundred people, it is hard
to find even one developer among them.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.640
Perhaps, one in a thousand.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:56.810
Are you going to bother all thousand of them
with a developer menu, or.. are you going

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:05.540
to make it easy for the 999 people, and a
little more complicated for that one developer

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.960
lady who is looking to run some Javascript.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.920
Here is a Third thing that you can try.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:27.779
In the world, there were 22.2 million airplane
flights in the year 2022.

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:30.089
22 million flights.

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:33.290
And, the number of crashes?

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.019
Just nine.

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:39.110
Nine crashes in 22 million flights.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:52.160
But, every flight, that lady, who is probably
bored to death, comes on stage, and bores

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.570
US to death with messages like “You have
to blow here, you have to wear like this,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:10.360
it will drop, the exits are there..” — but
the rule, the flight safety, aviation safety

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:18.610
federation, they expect that every flight
that is operated may crash!

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.899
And, hence we have to be ready, even though
it is only nine in twenty-two million.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.310
And, so, this has to be done without fail.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:32.170
But, they didn’t dictate terms on HOW it
should be done, did they?

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.100
What if I do it like this?

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.790
If I make it a brand of who I am?

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:44.430
A proud demonstration of how we do things
differently?

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:51.690
That’s what this airlines did!

00:10:51.690 --> 00:11:17.200
(Rap version of flight safety instructions)

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.970
Have you ever seen a group of passengers this
thrilled?

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.570
About flight safety instructions?

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:33.070
So, complexity, legal expectations, can be
rebranded also.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.410
Southwest Airlines.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:44.029
The last example I am giving you is probably
stretching things too much, but it was interesting

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:49.480
and falls under our category of hiding complexity.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480
See what happens!

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.700
We have seen this book earlier.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.870
Tony Fadell is the author.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.540
The person who famously designed the Apple
iPod.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:06.600
He also designed and launched the Nest thermostat
/ camera monitor / fire safety devices.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:12.019
Ended up selling the company to Google!

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:18.339
In this book, (we have encountered this book
earlier too), he talks about one particular

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:25.949
incident where he was about to take the Nest
Camera Monitor to the market.

00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:30.579
“You can set it up in your baby room..

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:42.160
And if the baby moves, if the baby falls,
if the baby cries, you will get an alert!”

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:49.500
— Everything went fine until the legal team
came and said, “Ahem, we have forgotten

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.930
something.. this has a long cable.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.310
And we will have to put this message.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.170
It is a choking hazard.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.019
A strangulation hazard.

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:02.920
The child may choke.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.600
The child may be strangulated.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600
Problem.”

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.149
Tony Fadell was livid.

00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:16.370
There is an App that goes with this device
and he had talked about the hazard in it.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.889
The box it comes in?

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:20.470
He has talked about the hazard there.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.610
Instruction manual?

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.430
Hazard notice clearly mentioned again.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.250
Video on how to install?

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.019
Carries the hazard notice too.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:29.920
But this guy said, “No way.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.329
This is such a beautiful device.

00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:38.399
I am not putting a warning sign like that.

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:41.899
With a baby being strangulated.

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:44.149
Being strangled to death.

00:13:44.149 --> 00:13:46.529
No way!”

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:49.250
The legal team came over and begged him.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.250
Please comply.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.360
There will be stiff fines, otherwise.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.690
He thought about it for long.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.649
And, guess what he did?

00:13:57.649 --> 00:14:00.050
Something very interesting.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.740
He overdid it!

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.970
This is what he did!

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:10.290
He put the label very close to the product
itself!

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.640
Not at the end of the cable, but at the beginning.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.480
He made the label twice the recommended side.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.709
Unwieldy, eyesore.

00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:27.810
He made it easy to tear off..

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:33.600
Unlike most stickers that are so hard to remove.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:43.240
And finally, that amazing touch, … he ensured
that when the label comes off, it doesn’t

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.290
leave a sticky glue residue.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:56.420
Basically, he made it very easy for users
to read it and do away with it.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:05.550
So, you CAN follow the rules but you can STILL
save yourself from adding unnecessary complexity,

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.940
by overdoing it.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.419
Don’t you agree?

00:15:11.419 --> 00:15:17.730
As a closing thought, I want to talk about
this little book here called the God Equation,

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.779
by Michio Kaku.

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:29.339
This is something that for a very long time
has bothered Stephen Hawking.

00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:32.290
Remember the movie that came, about him?

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.339
Theory of Everything.

00:15:33.339 --> 00:15:35.959
Well, why did they name it that?

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:39.410
That is what he was in the pursuit of.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:47.139
Something that combines electricity, magnetism,
gravity, quantum, .. something that puts all

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:50.610
this together and bring it up as governed
by a single theory.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:57.320
And, before Dr. Hawking, it was Albert Einstein
who grappled with the Unified Field Theory.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.019
So many great minds have struggled.

00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:04.880
They haven’t found the answer yet.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.740
No idea how long this would take either.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.240
People are talking about the string theory
as the best candidate for the unified theory.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.509
This Michio Kaku decided to write a book instead.

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:19.950
And, that, is the God Equation.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.399
Alright.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:27.140
Have a very simple uncomplicated life, until
we meet again next week!

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:35.610
Thank you!
