00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.900
In some food outlets, you might have noticed
a “Thank you” in this format.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.049
On your way out.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.130
They will say, “If you are happy with our
service, please tell others or leave us a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.130
Google review..

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.139
Spread the word..”

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.410
But, if you are not satisfied.., tell US.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.010
Nothing wrong, hoping to get feedback like
that, but is it practical??

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.480
If somebody has a bad thing to say about you,
would they restrict it just to your ears?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.940
Or, will I tweet it to the world?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.790
What is the mentality today?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:48.590
How do customers leave feedback, and how should
creators accept them?

00:00:48.590 --> 00:01:01.980
That’s the topic for the day, today!

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.470
Namaste!

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.619
Four hundred and fifty two is about Feedback.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.280
You give something out to the world, and the
world gives something back to you.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.900
Yes, they may give money, they may also give
happiness and thankfulness.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.750
But, they may also give feedback.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.799
Sometimes, criticism.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:42.330
But, when this criticism is given, when this
constructive feedback is given, should we

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.079
accept it all, or are there some checks and
some kind of cautions that we need to keep

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.100
in mind..?

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.180
Let us see!

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.320
First up, answer this question for me..

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320
Will you..?

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.790
Will you go to the doctor, and say, “I have
a problem..

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:13.459
it is itching me.. all over the underside
of my foot.. it is itching..” and the doctor

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.720
recommends that you do something, you stop
doing something, you apply a cream, you take

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.980
an injection, … and in response, you go,
“No no no no, that injection is for something

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.410
else, why are you recommending THIS to me
NOW, no no no no, this is a banned drug, there

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.490
is a counterindication…”

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.490
No.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.950
Will you do that?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.950
Or..

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.910
You go to the gym.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.330
And the trainer asks you to repeat a particular
exercise so many times.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.110
Or, he asks you to set this as the weight
and do this plyometric exercise.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.920
You… will you cross-question him?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.880
Will you ask, “Why are you recommending
THIS instead of THAT?”?”

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880
No!

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.349
So, what am I getting at then?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:10.280
There are a lot many more consumers than there
are creators.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.650
You are the creator.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.340
That person is the consumer.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:25.670
If that person could create, he would have
created it, or she would have created it.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.200
Not everybody in the world is a designer.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.849
You are the creator, and that should not be
forgotten.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:42.239
So, when they give you feedback, they give
it to you from their limited perspective.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:50.500
Accept it, acknowledge it, but don’t immediately
internalise it and start dancing to their

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.500
tunes.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.709
For, if you start dancing to their tunes,
guess what will happen?

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.540
No better than the fate that beset this person.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.860
So, rich man, two wives, that is a bold decision,
I am sure you agree..

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.970
So, there was this one wife who was old, and
every night, when the man was sleeping, she

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:22.109
would pluck away all the dark black hair that
this guy had on his head.. and then, on other

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:30.289
nights, when he was with this younger wife,
much younger in age, she, unhappy that he

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:38.750
was showing his age, she would pluck all the
silver hair, the grey hair.. and what happened?

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.669
Bold became bald!

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.690
By the way, I am SHAVING my head, I am not
bald!

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.690
Just saying!

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.110
So, why are we considering this example?

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.190
This is one of Aesop’s fables.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:03.380
If you are going to dance to a customer’s
tune, another will come along and make you

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.480
dance to a different tune.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.660
This is one of the classic warnings in the
startup world.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:20.169
Some of the greatest consultants and counsellors
in this game say, “Beware of your first

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.479
large customer”.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.680
You will be penniless.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.360
You will have a product ready.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.580
You will be in a desperate search for somebody
to buy your product.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.850
Along will come a person.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.240
A rich person.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:38.190
A person who will buy a MEGA subscription
on your product.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.100
You will lose your soul.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.140
Because?

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.990
That person is going to dictate the way forward
for that product from then on.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.289
Be very very careful of that!

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.289
Alright!

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:59.319
Here is a third thing to keep in mind.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:07.390
A user, when using a product, it is almost
like the jockey on the horse.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.120
Why?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.710
Well, who is winning the race?

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.870
Is it the horse?

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.009
Or is it the jockey?

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:26.060
If there is a problem, and the horse doesn’t
come first, will you blame the horse or..

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.540
the person on the horse?

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.319
The product creators will think, “The product
was actually very good, the user just didn’t

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.180
know how to…”

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.690
While the product users, the jockeys, will
say, “If only I had a better horse…”

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:56.640
If you take this to the next level, .. I hope
you remember that word, “Tsaheylu”.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:07.090
That word is from the Avatar movie.. where
the rider and the beast, they make a neural

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:13.920
connection.. that soul and this soul need
not exchange a single word from here on.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.410
Whatever you know, I will know.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.760
Whatever I feel, you will know..

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.310
That heart-to-heart, unspoken connection..

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.389
That is how a product and a user should get
connected..

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:36.500
And, when connected like that, they will not
speak out their woes.. because they won’t

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.130
even know..

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:44.770
We have encountered this quote in an earlier
Quotidian.. attributed to Henry Ford…

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.790
“If I had gone around asking my customers
what they wanted, they would have said ‘give

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.430
me faster horses’”!

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.430
No!

00:07:53.430 --> 00:08:00.220
When I am looking at a path-breaking innovation,
I can’t go around asking!

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.950
Steve Jobs didn’t ask “Hey, would you
all like a keyboard-less phone?”

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.950
No!

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.600
He didn’t!

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:17.620
So, the First Law of Usability, shockingly,
says, “Don’t listen to your user!

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.000
That is how they will blabber on!

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.389
They will say a hundred different things!

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:25.830
They will sob!

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.730
Do not listen to your user!”

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.849
Is it not shocking?

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:32.140
These are words from Jakob Nielsen himself!

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.700
The First Law of Usability — Do Not Listen
To Your User.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:44.490
Scrolling further down in the same article,
you will realise the full message.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:50.770
Do not LISTEN to your user SPEAK about the
problem.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.230
OBSERVE the user STRUGGLE THROUGH the problem.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.110
That is when you will learn.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:06.450
Otherwise, the user will mix their shortcomings
(like we saw in the case of the jockey and

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:14.810
the horse!) and the product’s shortcomings
and give you an amalgam.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:20.470
You would not be able to split things apart
and find out what you need to fix in your

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.470
product.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.150
Instead, observe!

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:29.410
In our backyard, we have this tree.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.720
The banana tree.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:41.480
My mom often refers to this tree and says,
“Every part, from the stem all the way to

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:49.380
the leaves, to the fruits, to the flower,
every part, we can use in our kitchen!”

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:57.769
But, that is a pretty rare thing, because
the reality is more often…

00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:01.000
There is this guy, Sturgeon, who came out
with his own Law.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.089
He was a science fiction author who published
a Law.

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:10.709
Before we get there, let us talk about musk.

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:12.720
Hey, not THAT Musk.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.720
This musk!

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.510
The musk deer.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.620
You don’t even want to know where musk comes
from.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.170
I don’t want to tell you anything further..

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.390
Google for it if you want!

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:32.350
Find out which organ, which part of the body,
is the source of this musk, this amazing scent

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.510
/ perfume product.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:41.450
So, ninety percent, ninety-five percent of
this deer, is useless.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.220
It doesn’t even have horns.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.230
Just long down-curving fangs.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.490
Looks ugly, actually.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.500
Nothing is sensational, exceptional.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.040
But, that specific secretion from that gland,
is amazing.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.950
So, that is Sturgeon’s Law.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.060
It says, Ninety percent of everything is crap!

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.380
Totally useless.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.110
Don’t even think about taking it to heart.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.029
Looking at a book?

00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:17.760
Ninety percent of it is useless.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.460
Only ten percent, there might be a takeaway.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.740
An author?

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.350
Well, ninety of the hundred books she may
have written would be good for nothing.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.410
Just ten might be useful.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.320
This sounds even worse than the famous Pareto’s
Principle!

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.140
Anyway, why are we talking about Sturgeon’s
Law here?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.889
User feedback — I am sorry — Ninety Percent
is Crap!

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:43.389
You can’t really make good use of it.

00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:50.820
It will either be over-the-top praising, or,
they will just be on a trip to destroy you,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.820
belittle you..

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:58.140
You need to wade past all that mire, and deep
down, if you drill, you will get some ten

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.920
percent of good feedback.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.380
You need to have the patience, the stamina,
to get down to that ten percent.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:15.370
If you get caught in the ninety-percent quagmire,
you will be not having any time at all to

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.089
build the next version of your product.

00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:27.079
The other problem with some developers, some
creators, is that they take things too far.

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.910
Assume you are building a car.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:35.639
One user asks you for a way to take his two
girlfriends in the car.

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:44.850
Another comes along and says he wants to take
all the tools that he has to his garage.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.910
He needs a truck-bed for the car.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.850
Can we satisfy both of them?

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.940
What do you think will happen?

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.510
You will get an odd-shaped vehicle..

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.810
This was called the Subaru BRAT.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:08.110
In fact, while advertising it in the 1980s,
they actually placed two women in it.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:14.200
Imagine taking two women in a car that you
own, seated like this.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.600
Would you want to?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.779
Would you dare to?!

00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:24.750
So, it is very easy for the creator to take
things too far, if they start listening to

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.240
customer feedback without that proper filter.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.130
Remember — Sturgeon’s Law — Ninety Percent
Crap.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:40.490
Finally, this is something Steve Jobs has
admonished us about very often!

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.639
Learn to say NO!

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.610
In the United States, there are many many
States.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.149
Some very beautiful ones too.

00:13:47.149 --> 00:13:51.100
And, one seemingly dull and boring nearly-nothing
State called Nebraska too!

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.520
That State came up with a beautiful advertisement
campaign.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.779
It said, “Lucky for you, there’s nothing
to do here!”

00:13:58.779 --> 00:13:59.920
They have nothing.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.180
They don’t even have a boat.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.930
They went on, “In Nebraska, we believe that
only boring people get bored.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.149
So, we invent our own fun.

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:12.769
Like when we realised that a livestock tank
would float, and thought, “It’s a boat!”

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:18.630
Soon, “tanking” became the preferred method
of meandering down our slow-moving rivers.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:30.149
It might not be everybody’s cup of tea,
but if it sounds as good to you as it did

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:31.310
to us, welcome aboard!”

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.260
What are they pointing out here?

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.449
Nebraska didn’t try to California.

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:39.250
It said, we are Nebraska.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.600
If you are looking for California-like fun,
go to California!

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.600
Here is the phone number!

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.660
We would love people LIKE US to come here.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.140
We will take very good care of them, and give
them a memory of a lifetime!

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.570
That should be your stance too!

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:03.269
If you have a product that lacks a feature,
and you had consciously taken a decision not

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:09.400
to include that feature in your product, just
because some customer is asking for it, you

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.170
shouldn’t make that change!

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:18.720
You should boldly say, we are Nebraska!

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:29.889
Ka — is the name of 
a book.

00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:33.720
Stories of the Mind and Gods of India.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.360
It tells a lot about Gods, mythology, India,
history, culture…

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.170
A book written by an Italian.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.970
But.. this book taught me more about Indian
culture, the Vedas, Gods and Godliness-concepts

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.250
than many Indian books by Indian authors had.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.240
This Roberto Calasso.. in this book by him..
there is a discussion about Immortality.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:16:00.260
We all know that the Devas are immortal, that
they live forever..

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:11.959
Somewhere, invisible, up there, high in the
heavens…

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:16.180
He gives a beautiful new twist to this belief.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.699
He says, at one point, the Devas wanted immortality..

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:25.690
Begged God, for what?

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.980
For permission to hide between the lines of
the Vedas.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.520
The books had been written.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.220
They were destined to be immortal.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.440
They will always exist as long as human kind
is around..

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.360
Will you please mention me..?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:49.829
Surya, is not Immortal because he is there
forever.

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:56.949
Surya is immortal because he has been immortalised
in the lines of the book.

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.940
That was the twist!

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.280
Why am I telling this here?

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:10.040
Customers will want something without realising
that is what they want.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.030
They may ask for a button in the right bottom
of the screen..

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.490
You shouldn’t immediately rush in and promise
them, “No problem!

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.890
Will get that added in by tomorrow afternoon!”

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.480
That is foolishness.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.539
Ask WHY instead.

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:27.339
You may remember the Five Whys approach we
had discussed earlier.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:31.260
To ask Whys is the wise thing to do!

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.390
Catch my point!

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.080
So, ask a Why!

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:41.760
And, the user may say, “If there is a button,
it would be easier for me to save the file.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:50.890
It is too hard and effortful to go to the
menu and choose Save”..

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.520
And, you say, “How about AutoSave?

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:58.059
Every five seconds, as you edit the document,
what if I automatically save the latest version?

00:17:58.059 --> 00:17:59.360
Would that suit your need?”

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.380
The user exclaims, “Wow!

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.510
That is exactly what I want!”

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.930
So, ask those Whys!

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.170
Do not just give…

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.090
When the Devas approached God, He didn’t
just offer them that boon.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:21.929
He said, “I will give you Immortality, but
not the way you want it, but in a better way”!

00:18:21.929 --> 00:18:27.640
So, that should be your intent too..

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:34.240
Try to think why the customer is asking for
something.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.040
Ask those five Whys.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.470
As a closing thought, I am going to tell you
a short story.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.169
The connection between this story and this
episode?

00:18:43.169 --> 00:18:45.720
I will let you deduce the tenuous connection
yourself..!

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.860
I am not going to make that connection for
you.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.340
I don’t want to offend you by doing that.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.480
There was a bench in a park…

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.320
On that bench, an old man..

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.240
Very poor man..

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.630
Almost.. looking like a beggar.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:08.611
He even had a small bowl where people were
throwing money in.

00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:13.130
He looked unwell, he looked tired, .. he was
coughing.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:21.360
I wanted to give him some money, so I went
near him and I put some money into his outstretched

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.360
hand..

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:33.270
But, unable to stop with that, I looked at
the man, at his dress, at the empty bottles

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.590
inside his bag, .. unable to keep silent,
I quipped..

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:41.360
“Don’t immediately take this money and
blow it all away at the nearest drinks shop..

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360
Okay, old man?

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360
Eat good food.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.370
Use for it instead..

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:53.360
Okay?”

00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:04.890
That man turned towards me, fierce penetrating
eyes.. and muttered, “Do I tell you how

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:10.490
to spend YOUR money?”

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:17.350
We will meet soon..

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.160
Thank you!
