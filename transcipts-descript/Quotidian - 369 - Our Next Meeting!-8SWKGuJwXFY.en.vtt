00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:09.280
It is really a paradox. An understandable
puzzle. I really want to understand why. 365

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:21.199
days. I launch 365 videos. And I get about
220, 210 views per day on an average. The

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:30.160
next eight days, I launch three videos, and
I get 400 views on average. Where do I lament

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:47.870
about this? Who do I cry about this to?!
(Intro Music)

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:57.830
Namaste! On the eve of New Year, the night
of December 31, 2021, I received a very long

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:05.870
message, an unusually long message, from a
real well-wisher. The message went like this:

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.870
They congratulated me of course, and they
said, "Amazing work.. But I already knew.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.540
I knew it on January 1 itself, that you would
keep your word about this sequence!" - and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:26.310
they added a small incendiary bomb to go with
it: "And, if not for the brake I have applied

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:36.400
now, you will continue for 1000 or even 10,000
days!"

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.659
She's my wife. Messaging me. She continued.
She went on with further messages of appreciation.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.370
Crystallising the situation. The discipline
to do this - really hard. The effort you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.890
put in to make each episode as interesting
as possible - truly taxing. And, to do

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:09.850
this as a hobby while being busy at your day-job
at the same time, it is a real stretch. And,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:20.410
she also appreciated me for being a good husband,
good son, and a good parent, while continuing

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.390
to do this. And she underlined it as insane.
It is insanely impossible. And you have only

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.950
basically sacrificed your free time and your
sleep. Not fair. Not good. Don't do it.&nbsp;

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.630
Almost as if she was giving me a lesson in
the art of giving feedback, she continued,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.890
with this message:-
Hats off, and I want you to reduce the frequency

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.980
so that you get to take care of yourself.
That "smart introduction" of "and" instead

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.900
of "but"… It is not "hats off, but stop"…
It is "hats off, and change". We have actually

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.520
addressed this in an earlier Quotidian. Probably
she has watched that one?? So, this was the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.930
feedback she gave me, and I decided to follow
that sage advice.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.030
At the same time that this was happening,
I wrote to some of our viewers via Whatsapp

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.060
and asked them for opinions and feedback.
And, one of them, you could even call him

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.640
a rare breed, is a person who quit a high-paying
high-tech software job and dove headlong into

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:47.140
the educational community, wanting to volunteer.
He has been running Team Everest for more

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.900
than a decade now. One of the most successful
volunteering NGOs in this educational domain.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.489
It is called Team Everest. Karthee Vidya,
the founder of that organisation, he sent

00:04:00.489 --> 00:06:12.240
me this message.&nbsp;
(Embedded Video Message from Karthee Vidya)

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.559
Thank you, thank you, Karthee! A few others
also gave me this feedback.. and I also started

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:26.770
noticing that I was finding it harder and
harder to ensure that I didn't repeat something

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.639
that I had said earlier. In fact, two viewers
who were regular followers, pulled me up once

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:39.000
for using the same title for two Quotidians.
I think their name is Sumitra. So, there was

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.860
that little fear coming in, that I need to
probably get my house in order, before just

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.930
continuing everyday.. That was another little
thought that I started getting.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:58.860
Which is why we came up with this nice little
plan, and I proposed this to the group, and

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:09.780
I shared it with all of you. I even gave a
little clue in the Closing Thought of 365.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:19.580
"There is a phrase in English. As Easy As
Apple Pie. So, I want to tell you this. Quotidians

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:31.309
are not as easy as apple pie, to make.. Not
as easy as apple pie.. apple pie.. But, we

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:34.249
will continue! Thank you for your patronage,
looking forward to meeting you soon! Bye Bye!"

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:44.139
That is how we had ended Quotidian 365. I
had thought I had given a decent enough clue..

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:52.030
Two smart people from Zoho, one a student
who is currently undergoing Zoho Schools cracked

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:59.479
it. And she said, okay,&nbsp;… pi? The digits
of the irrational number Pi? That is how you

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:07.039
are jumping along. Am I right? - She asked
me. Yes, Renuga Devi, you are right!

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:14.449
Another friend, and colleague, a faculty at
Zoho Schools, he cracked it too, and he said,

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:21.330
this is how it is progressing, am I right..?
I asked him why he was so smart!&nbsp;:-) And

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:34.140
he said, he was in doubt, but looking at the
mention of Apple Pie, you pronounced Pie thrice

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:40.150
too, and so, I decided I should be right in
my approach. Is it right? - Yes, it is

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:48.680
right. We follow the digits, the infinite
digits that come after the decimal in the

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.510
expansion of pi. We process each digit. It
goes 3.14…. yes? 1 would correspond to a

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:06.370
gap of 1 day. 4 would correspond to a gap
of 4 days. And so on. That is the proposed

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:17.180
plan. The four-th day. The one-th day. The
zero-th day. Anyway, I will be sharing when

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.200
our next appointment would be, just in case
you want to know. Otherwise, just subscribe

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:31.160
to my Whatsapp group, or the YouTube subscription
itself, and you will be alerted when it is

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.000
ready.&nbsp;
The faculty member, Manoj Nair is his name,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.050
he even wrote a program to list out when the
next Quotidian would be, and sent the results

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:49.730
to me. Q500 would be on 22 September 2023.
Q1000 would be in 2029. We all should be around

00:09:49.730 --> 00:10:01.810
till then, that's the sequence we are going
to continue with. The idea was to let it continue..

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:10.480
I wanted something unending. I wanted something
that would allow me to be irrational. Illogical.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.020
Paradoxical. Conflicting something that I
had said earlier. Pi is the best. Because,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:24.970
you cannot bring any sequence or true pattern
into Pi. People have searched far and wide.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:30.740
22 Trillion digits of pi have been analysed.
Unending. And irrational.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:37.040
To understand about Pi, to learn about it,
I don't need to teach you. A little query

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.270
on Google will do. Just take a look. 21 fascinating
facts, 10 surprising facts, 7 interesting

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:49.020
facts, 28 facts, 10 facts, 36 surprising facts,
70 facts,&nbsp;… there is simply too much you

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.790
can look up. So, I want to step away from
the mathematical, philosophical, biological,&nbsp;…

00:10:53.790 --> 00:11:02.180
pi has a role to play in all of these.. concepts.
And I want to go to the world of movies. The

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:08.730
world of tele serials.&nbsp;
A serial titled Person of Interest - in

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:14.480
Amazon Prime. I used to watch this series.
This actor, by name Emerson, standing in the

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:22.980
middle, plays the role of a person named Finch.
Finch is a mathematician, a computer genius,

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:29.490
who creates probably the first true artificially
intelligent software. And, it so happens that

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:37.820
he is Maths Teacher for a day, as substitute
faculty. So, he will be in that class, teaching

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.820
to distracted kids, and… when asked why
they are so lackadaisical, one of the students

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:48.680
responds, "What are you teaching us.. about
pi.. you have drawn a circle on the board..

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:59.750
what is it for, how is it going to be good
for me, what will I use it for"… And, the

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.270
professor launches into a one-and-a-half minute
lecture. A beautiful speech.&nbsp;

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:16.310
"This pi is just a ratio between a circle's
circumference and its diameter. Unending.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:28.060
Non-repeating. A number, in the same sequence,
pattern, you will never see it again in pi.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:37.200
What does it really mean then? That string
of decimals that stand for pi.. everything

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.250
sits inside it. Everything. Your home phone
number. Your door number. Your Aadhaar number.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:48.860
Your cellphone lockscreen code. Your score
in last month's maths test. The score the

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:55.550
guy next to you got. Your birthday. Everything
sits inside this somewhere. Every number is

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:03.430
inside. And,&nbsp;… if you assign letters equivalent
to the numbers, like A stands for 1, D stands

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:09.500
for 4,&nbsp;… then, everything that Shakespeare
wrote is sitting inside. Why… even the message

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.870
you sent your boyfriend yesterday, that too.
Your biography, sits inside. Whatever you

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:24.000
did till now, the first word you spoke as
a baby, all the words you are going to speak

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.230
from now on, everything sits inside. So, the
infinite possibilities that exist in this

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:40.721
world, sits here, within that circle. Circle
of Life! What a poignant thought! So, what

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:49.470
you do with this information is entirely up
to you, my dear!" says the professor. So,

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:55.150
I decided to use that information for our
next jump in pi.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:06.060
But, end of the day, I am a Tamilian. I wanted
to talk to you about Kondrai Vendhan 67. Guess

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:15.961
what it says? "Paiyach chendraal vaiyam thaangum".
Seems, in Tamil, "paiya" means "slowly". In

00:14:15.961 --> 00:14:25.230
other words, "Go Slow, and the world will
support you, appreciate you, welcome you".&nbsp;

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.650
Please! Thank you!

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:32.501
