00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:13.009
Reading, happiness, love, romance, passion,
sex, intelligence, overworking, … something

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:20.340
is common among all these words. And, if you
throw them into Google and search for what

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.510
is common, you will notice that there are
articles, there are posters, out there on

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.760
the web, where they claim that each of these,
each of these!, is overrated! Among those,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:47.940
specifically one word, a word that is frequently
talked about as overrated, and that is the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:00.430
word we are going to talk about today!
Namaste!

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:20.590
Long back, around ten, twelve years ago, Elon
Musk, when asked about, “Hey, what is it

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.329
to be an entrepreneur..? You have not built
one company.. Not two companies.. You have

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.670
been a serial entrepreneur.. And you’ve
been quite successful at it.. What is your

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.479
secret?!”, he says, “One needs a tolerance
for pain. You need to be able to withstand

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.619
tremendous amounts of pain. You need to, in
fact, WANT it! You need to be the kind of

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.679
guy who wants more and more pain!”.. And
he goes on to quote this memorably:- “Being

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:06.329
an entrepreneur is like staring into the abyss…
a bottomless pit. A hellish deep. You are

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:13.549
staring into the abyss, no idea what’s inside,
no idea what’s waiting for you, and… while

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:23.819
doing that, you are also eating glass!”
Staring into the abyss, eating glass! That

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.330
is how Elon Musk conveys what the entrepreneur’s
life is like.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.959
Even before this… when Bill Gates and Steve
Jobs got together… It is pretty rare.. You

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.030
don’t see these two opponents.. Two of the
greatest companies in Silicon Valley. Apple

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.480
and Microsoft. They don’t sit together too
often! When they got together… at a conference

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.840
called the D Conference.. Just a few years
before Steve Jobs died… during that interview,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.480
Steve says something very important about
the importance of passion, … What is passion,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.799
and why is it important! Listen!
“People say you have to have a lot of passion

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.440
for what you’re doing and it’s totally
true. And the reason is because it’s so

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.721
hard that if you don’t, any rational person
would give up. It’s really hard. And you

00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.630
have to do it over a sustained period of time.
So if you don’t love it, if you’re not

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.730
having fun doing it, you don’t really love
it, you’re going to give up. And that’s

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.840
what happens to most people, actually. If
you really look at the ones that ended up,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.560
you know, being “successful” in the eyes
of society and the ones that didn’t, oftentimes,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.510
it’s the ones [who] were successful loved
what they did so they could persevere, you

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.230
know, when it got really tough. And the ones
that didn’t love it quit because they’re

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.189
sane, right? Who would want to put up with
this stuff if you don’t love it? So it’s

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:04.500
a lot of hard work and it’s a lot of worrying
constantly and if you don’t love it, you’re

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.980
going to fail. So you’ve got to love it
and you’ve got to have passion…”

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.594
One word. Passion. He so easily slips it off
his tongue, and gets away! Great man that

00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:22.100
he is! What is that passion, and is it really
overrated? And, is it a general word that

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.820
we can throw at something and be passionate
about it and we will succeed? Or, is there

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.950
some formula for it? Passionate about what?
How passionate? Passion at what times? If

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.470
you wonder there is a formula for this…
well… this might be a good guidebook for

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.160
you. It is called The Entrepreneur Roller
Coaster. Darren Hardy is the author. In this

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:58.440
book, he talks about four switches, not one,
not two, but four switches, each of these

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.530
four you can turn on. Each of these four you
can be passionate about. And, each of them

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:13.920
will leave with different intensity, with
different stamina and sustainability, towards

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:22.140
your goal. What are those four switches??
The first switch.. it is like lightning. You

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:29.590
have no idea when it is coming. You have no
idea when it will strike again. Powerful.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.880
Very powerful. It can break a house down,
it can burn a tree up, but.. you can’t read

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.160
a book in the light you get from lightning,
however bright it is! So, the question there

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:53.180
is — Being passionate about WHAT you do!
Am I passionate about what I am doing? Good

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.480
question. Many people decide their careers
based on their answer to that question. But..

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:06.050
there is a very fundamental problem hiding
there. We have seen this problem earlier too.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:15.570
The problem is — 95/5 division between what
you really like doing, and all the other things

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:22.680
you have to do, to get there. Don’t you
agree? Work is going to suck. 95 percent of

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.500
the time. Whatever work you do.. Even if you
are A R Rahman himself, or the great A B De

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:39.210
Villiers… There is a lot of other work you
have to do, to somehow get to that 5% awesomeness.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:46.620
Yes, it is awesome. Ecstatic. But, like lightning.
One can’t trust that, and say, they are

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:54.700
passionate about this, and be misled. We have
talked about it in an earlier Quotidian, 079,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.510
and we have talked about the 80/20 rule. Pareto’s
Principle. In fact, if you look at the new

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.630
input today, you would realise it is not 80/20
but closer to 95/5!

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:18.890
What is the second switch? The second switch
is like The Sun. It is there! High up in the

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.460
sky, guiding you, giving you warmth, giving
you light, all the time.. Okay, not all the

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:31.410
time. At night, it is a bit harder. But, it
is there. All you have to do is look up. And,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:38.650
the second question that you will have to
ask yourself is, “Am I passionate about

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:48.370
WHY I am doing this..?” We have talked about
this, at length, earlier too. Starting with

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:54.570
Why, was the overarching theme. Simon Sinek’s
Golden Circle. Starting with Why is the most

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.820
important thing you have to do. Not what you
are producing. Not the manufacturing process.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:08.210
But, why you are doing it. That is very important.
If you want to dig deeper, yes, there is an

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:17.120
earlier Quotidian for you. Quotidian 201.
Starting with Why. Yes, that is the second

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.700
switch, and it is much better than being passionate
about WHAT you are doing. Because… what

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:31.050
you are doing is about the thing that you
are getting ready, and why you are doing it

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:39.780
is the impact it is going to have. So, Why
is more important than the What.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:48.190
The third switch? The third switch is like
a table lamp. Anytime you want, you can switch

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:55.360
it on, you can bring something close to it,
you can get light to shine on it, and you

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:03.340
can make better sense. The question in the
Third Switch is, are you passionate about

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:09.150
HOW you are doing it… The thing about being
passionate about WHY you are doing it is…

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:17.000
only when the end result is meaningful enough,
good enough, you can say, okay, this is the

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.440
end result, this is the impact this is having,
and so, that is my WHY, and I am passionate

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:31.060
about it… But, what about all the beginners?
All the newcomers? All those starry-eyed entrepreneurs

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.501
who WANT to get started but who are shabby,
who are not skilled, who are clueless, what

00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:46.260
way out do they have? The solution for them
is “Start by being passionate about HOW

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:54.960
you are doing it!” The process. The method.
The 95/5 rule breaks down here. Because, even

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:02.560
if I am spending only five percent of my time
doing that WHAT, even in that rest of the

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.230
ninety-five percent of the time, I will be
doing things that prepare me for that five

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:18.640
percent. And, that is the HOW! So, I get to
enjoy that ecstasy much more than just doing

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.870
it in that five percent. So, that is the third
question. Be passionate about HOW you are

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:32.500
doing it. The routines. The little things.
The consistency. The sustained effort you

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:41.340
put in everyday, becoming incrementally better.
That is what we have called as Flow, earlier.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:47.270
When you are in flow, you don’t even notice
the passage of time, you don’t know you

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:53.980
are getting hungry, you are getting tired,
you are in a Zone of your own. You are challenged,

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.800
and you know your capabilities can meet that
challenge. That is the switch number three.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:08.690
Being passionate about HOW you are doing it.
Great! What comes beyond all this.. What is

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:17.480
the fourth switch? What is the most important
switch perhaps? That is the switch you can

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:26.040
wear on your head. Like a torchlight, if you
attach it to your helmet, wherever you turn,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:36.030
whenever you want, whatever you want light
to be shined on to, will be lit. Anytime.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:45.090
Isn’t that the most comfortable? The question
here is: Are you passionate about WHO you

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:53.400
are doing it for..? Who are you doing it for?
For the people? For the country? For self-pride?

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:02.250
For Mother Earth? For the family? For your
company? To destroy your competitor? Who are

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:09.090
you doing it for?
Just yesterday, news hit us about Satya Nadella,

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:16.620
the Microsoft CEO, his son, Zain Nadella,
passing away at the young age of 26. Just

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:26.360
twenty-six years old. Cerebral Palsy. Severe
case of cerebral palsy. He passed away at

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:34.570
just 26. And, I was reminded of the book,
Hit Refresh, that he wrote. A book that Satya

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:40.500
Nadella had penned while he was still the
CEO of Microsoft. In that book, in a particular

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:48.380
chapter, he talks about the impact his son,
and the problem his son has, has had on his

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:55.120
career. I have highlighted a little box there,
but you can read the whole thing. He says,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.520
I am at the hospital. I hear beep beeps everywhere.
I see monitors everywhere. There is hardware.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:08.050
There is software. Data is being synced to
the cloud. That is when it hit me — our

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:16.140
work at Microsoft transcended business. It
is not just about business, revenue, profit.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:25.100
Far beyond that. A life. Protecting it, maintaining
it, comforting it. That was the work we were

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:38.330
doing. That was the feeling I got. A fragile
young boy. We were being a lifeline for him.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:44.940
And then he says, “Being an empathetic father,
and bringing that desire to discover what

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:52.250
is at the core, the soul, makes me a better
leader”. I recommend that you read the whole

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:59.660
book, but this is the essence of how he conveys
the impact his son has had. Every day, after

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:07.290
finishing work and heading home, when I see
him, … so goes the narrative. So, the question

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:14.660
you ask yourself here is, “Am I passionate
about who I am doing it for”. That is the

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.640
final question. That is probably the most
important question.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:26.160
Well then, we saw four switches. What am I
doing? Am I passionate about it? Why am I

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:33.380
doing it? Am I passionate about that? How
am I doing it? Does that stoke passion in

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:43.529
me? Who am I doing it for? That is the most
important type of passion.

00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:49.380
When we talk about the word “passion”,
the inner meaning, the original meaning of

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:58.251
the word is important too. If you search in
Google for the “etymology of passion”,

00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:03.870
the story, the origin story for the word,
you will notice something very interesting.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:23.870
Yes, there is Latin, there is French, all
mixed in. Pati. Latin. To endure, to undergo,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.240
to experience. Passionem. Suffering. Enduring.
Passion. Christ’s passion. Physical suffering.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.851
Unbearable pain being borne, because you like
it. There was even a movie titled “The Passion

00:15:29.851 --> 00:15:34.750
of Jesus Christ”. I was wondering, what
this was all about. How could Jesus be connected

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.040
with, wink wink, Passion?! A movie by Mel
Gibson. But, that’s when it occurred to

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.110
me. The original meaning of that word is all
about suffering and enduring, because you

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:52.190
are driven by a higher purpose. So, understand
the right meaning of the word, turn on the

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:59.060
correct switch, meet you at the other side.
By the way, we are done with 2, I will meet

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.290
you on the 9th. Thank you!
