00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.129
Do you remember this picture?

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.270
Ink drawing?

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.899
Of children?

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.420
Yes!

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.670
Jordan Peterson’s Twelve Rules For Life
book.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.570
For each chapter, the artist had given a beautiful
visual prompt and incorporated the author’s

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
children.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.820
This one appears in Chapter Number One.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.060
Kids, fine.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.920
But, that aquarium?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.840
The lobsters inside it?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:47.520
That is what we are going to learn about,
today!

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.090
Namaste!

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:59.670
Four Hundred Sixty One is about stories from
deep underwater.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.010
I am not a biologist.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.940
I am not a marine zoologist.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.689
But, from the books I have read, the interesting
things I have encountered, I want to share

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.189
with you today.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.840
Let’s get started.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.880
The Starfish.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.140
This is usually found in the seashore.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.330
And, shallow waters.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.990
What lesson can we learn from this Starfish?

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.950
We have seen this already.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.079
The regenerative power.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.240
Decentralised regenerative power, to be precise.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:54.850
A lizard can shed its tail, distract its enemy,
run away, live another day, and grow its tail

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.080
back!

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.110
Similarly, a Starfish can shed its limb to
distract an enemy.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.270
Or, might get injured and lose one of its
limbs.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.060
It can GROW its limb back.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.520
But, you know what’s even more special about
the Starfish?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:27.350
Not only can a Starfish with an injured limb
grow its limb back… the limb.. listen to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.220
me.. the limb can grow the Starfish back!

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.790
Did you get it?

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.569
Goosebumps yet?

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.260
That teaches us a lesson.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.019
Decentralisation.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:58.410
Information duplicated so that even if one
person, one entity, loses it, forgets it,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.610
or is destroyed, it can be brought back from
somebody else.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.360
In a team management scenario, I think it
is such an important lesson.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.989
That is the lesson from the Starfish.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.340
The Sea Turtle.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.000
Swims very well.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.030
Has long flippers.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.720
Is so beautiful to look at, if you have the
right viewpoint.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.330
Rides on water currents.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.690
Is a good scavenger.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.849
What is special about this animal though,
is, it is related to tortoises, it lives long,

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:52.460
it is slow when it needs to be, all that is
fine.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:03.120
But, the Sea Turtle and the Land Tortoise
differ, the way I see it, on one very important

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.120
characteristic.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.660
The Sea Turtle cannot retract its limbs into
its shell.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.040
If you trouble a Tortoise, it will withdraw
its limbs into its shell.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.799
But, the Turtle cannot.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.170
And, I think it is a good lesson for us.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.500
Very often, when faced with difficulties,
challenges, troubles, we think we can just

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:38.160
retract into a shell, wait for the storm to
blow over, and most of the times, it doesn’t

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
blow over.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.080
So, you need to FACE THE MUSIC.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.250
You don’t have a shell to withdraw into.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.580
You have to react.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.400
You have to do it proactively.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.680
This is the deck you have been dealt with.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:01.390
That is the lesson this Sea Turtle teaches
me.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:09.621
The third living thing from deep underwater,
that we are going to see, SEA, is the Seahorse.

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:14.620
Sea Horse.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.640
Some of you may have heard, and you may have
guessed what the lesson is..

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640
Yes..

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.070
This is probably one of the very few species
on earth where the Male plays a very important

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.490
role in childbirth.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.380
There are an infinitude of living things in
this world, amazing miracles all around, but,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.360
whatever the number of variations, usually,
99 percent of the time, it is the Female of

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.240
the species that has to go through the pangs
of childbirth.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:01.789
Be it pregnancy, be it the carrying, be it
the delivery, it is the Mother who bears the

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.460
brunt of that job.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:11.000
Yes, Daddy does help on the side, but, the
Mother bears it all.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:22.440
This living thing, once the mating dance is
over, the Mother, the Female, deposits thousands

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.020
of eggs into a special pouch that the Father
has.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.610
And, it is not some silly external pouch like
the one in the kangaroo..

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.919
It is a pouch that is fed blood..

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:35.919
Like the placenta.

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:45.570
And, it carries its eggs in that pouch for
many weeks.. and once the live young grow

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.470
to a particular size, it releases them into
the water.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:59.310
I think, for too long, we have had this unequal,
imbalanced division of labour.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.940
“Labour” — pun intended.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.340
Man has to play a bigger role, helping the
Woman.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.430
That is the lesson I get from this living
thing.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.669
We can’t even call it an animal — so strange
is it!

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:19.669
Dolphins!

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:29.280
Just the very sight of it brings a wide smile
to your face.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.620
A new kind of energy and vivaciousness.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.430
As playful as a Dolphin, they say.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.690
In fact, if you do some research on the internet,
you would come to know that you can even say

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.020
“As smart as a Dolphin”.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.900
They have a developed language; it is just
whistles and clicks, but they have a developed

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.440
language.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.530
They can solve puzzles.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.830
There is a community online who think..

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:06.280
the Dolphins are smarter than human beings..

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.310
Evolution started in the seas.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.310
Came to the shores.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.310
Crossed into land.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.310
Climbed into trees.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.360
Climbed down again, became humans..

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.220
That is how popular belief goes.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:24.430
But, there is a little branch, in that evolutionary
tree.. where, the animals that were moving

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:32.180
into land, had a change of mind and went back
into the sea.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.930
That is why Dolphins will drown underwater.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.250
They need air to breathe!

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.360
Their biology is very different from that
of fish.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.589
What lesson do I take from these?

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:59.399
The advent of evolution, getting better all
the time, need not be a one-way race.

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:01.470
I am the first.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.470
I am the fastest.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.470
I am the tallest.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.700
I am the strongest.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.860
My technology.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.990
Faster and faster.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.220
Better and better.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.150
Need not be a one-way race.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:22.310
Probably the Dolphins are smart enough to
realise that they don’t need all that we

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.220
have surrounded ourselves with.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.850
Sounds odd and strange, I know.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:34.750
But, when you look at their faces, they seem
to have a smile..

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.790
A wistful smile, sometimes.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.750
A playful smile, some other times.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.800
What are they thinking..?

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.410
Are they saying, “This is why I warned you
about it all, and asked you to return to the

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.120
water?”

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.860
Are they smiling at what we have brought upon
ourselves?

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:06.910
Is moving away from technology and reconnecting
with human beings, the physical, biological,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:11.610
natural way, the right way forward?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.780
That is the lesson I learn from the playful
Dolphin.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.780
The Octopus.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.750
We have seen this earlier too.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.800
We learned that it had nine brains!

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.440
Another interesting thing that you may want
to know about the Octopus is.. it has got

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.700
no bones!

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.950
“No bones” — is a phrase in English.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.790
And, this is what it means.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.209
But, without bones?

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.829
What advantage?

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:50.130
It can squeeze itself the smallest of gaps.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.140
Adaptiveness.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.200
Being ready for any eventuality.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.230
Being accommodative.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:12.149
Saying, “I can manage, I can adjust” is
probably the most important attitude in today’s

00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:13.149
fast-changing world.

00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:16.829
Darwin’s evolutionary theory didn’t talk
about the survival of the strongest.. or even

00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:17.829
the fittest.

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:23.529
It was actually about the survival of the
most adaptable..

00:11:23.529 --> 00:11:25.829
Most adaptive.

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:30.570
The fastest adapting animal?

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.420
That will rule the game, the theory said.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.089
The Octopus is a ruler, in that sense.

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:40.570
How adaptive can you be?

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.840
Keep the Octopus in mind.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.900
Deep underwater, there is this Angler Fish.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:55.870
This fish plays a cameo role in the Finding
Nemo movie.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.510
Bioluminescence..

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:09.160
A fin has evolved into something that can
act like a trap for other little fish to come

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.540
in search of, so that the mouth can eat it.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.790
What lesson do I take from this monster?

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:23.710
There are two ways to react to darkness..

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.560
Other than just living in darkness.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.850
One?

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.550
You can move towards the light.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.940
Like the sunflower does.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.709
I can turn towards the light.

00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:38.260
Chase the light.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.699
The other way?

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:43.510
The Angler Fish teaches us..

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.510
Be our own light!

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.510
How beautiful!

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:52.420
If you are caught in a quandary, one way would
be to go in search of happiness..

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.840
Where is succour..

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.060
OR, you can be the giver of light.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.910
You can be the fount of happiness and joy.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.579
Think about it.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.880
The next animal, again from Finding Nemo,
is this fish.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.830
Dory is her name.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.589
But the original species name is Royal Blue
Tang.

00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:23.610
This particular fish is excessively forgetful.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.139
Once every few seconds, it catches itself
blanked out, and asks, “Where was I?

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.149
What was I saying?”

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:29.420
Forgets its own name too!

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:35.029
When I dug into the research, I learned that
the problem is not widespread across the species

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:36.029
itself..

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:42.839
That a goldfish has an eight-second attention
span, etc, is just an urban myth.

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:49.019
But, there is a lesson we can learn from Dory.

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:50.870
“Forget and Forgive!”

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:56.540
If you can’t remember stuff, you can’t
hold a grudge, can you?!

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.279
“You punched me in the face so heartlessly,”
versus “Did you punch me?

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.279
Really?

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:03.640
I don’t seem to recall!”

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.370
— How different..!

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.200
Wise people give a specific piece of advice.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.430
Forgive, but do not forget, they say.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:16.210
Don’t forget, for you are likely to get
stuck in a very similar problem pretty soon.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.389
But there is a lesson there.

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:26.760
There are things worth forgetting, and probably
you should cultivate that Art, looking at

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.060
Dory.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:37.450
This is the reason I even did this video.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:42.500
Remember, in the beginning?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.139
That in the Jordan Peterson book, he refers
to lobsters?

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:46.139
I came to know about something unusual, unique,
and quite interesting, about lobsters, when

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:48.370
I read that first chapter.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:55.550
Lobsters.. deep underwater creatures, they
are basically walkers on the sea floor.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.470
They grow very large..

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.810
Some weight as much as seven, or eight kilograms.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.350
They are very territorial.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:13.810
There are very few places in the hostile ground
deep underwater, where it can find a safe

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.810
haven.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.000
But, competitors for those few spots?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.649
Thousands of lobsters competing all the time!

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:23.910
How do they resolve it?

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:29.720
It seems they have a four-level conflict resolution
mechanism.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:40.350
Level 1 is — they have little jets of liquid
that squirt from under their eye sockets.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.079
“This is my height.

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:43.819
This is my weight.

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:44.819
This is my power.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:45.819
This is my gender.

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:48.519
This is my mood” they seem to broadcast,
to anybody who cares to come near.

00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:50.490
The others broadcast their details too.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.700
These two lobsters receive each other’s
chemicals, and decide, then and there, whether

00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:00.579
to boldly get into combat or to slink away
at the sight of more formidable competition.

00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:02.250
They will resolve it, it seems.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.160
If that doesn’t work well enough, Level
2.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.389
Level 2 is braggadocio.

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:11.270
“Do you know who I am?

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.720
Do you know how great I am?”

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.000
They brandish.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.910
They don’t touch.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.180
They brandish.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.630
Most conflicts end at this level itself.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.180
Level 3 — they parry.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.360
They kinda push.. they try to SHOW you how
powerful they are..

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.700
That’s Level 3.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:45.519
Only if that doesn’t work out either, that’s
when Level 4 comes into the game.

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:48.370
Level 4 is deadly.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:55.709
Push, pull, grab, sever, cut, tear, throw.

00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:58.880
It can even tear a limb.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.130
Blind an eye.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:10.699
And, when such a conflict happens, the lobster
that was thinking it was good, suddenly realises

00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:12.709
it isn’t good enough.

00:17:12.709 --> 00:17:13.949
It loses.

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:19.689
And, such a losing lobster, … they have
done brain research..

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:22.550
A lobster’s brain is very easy to decode.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.919
A very simple neural network.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:31.200
And, easily decodable, because of its simplicity
and its size.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:40.160
And, they have learned, while analysing it,
that the Lost Lobster goes through a transformation

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.030
of the brain.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.030
The brain literally dissolves!

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.110
And reconfigures!

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.990
No old memories.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.860
No old chemicals.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.740
No old structures.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:05.840
Completely new, submissive, shy, servant brain
forms.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.200
Octopamine and Serotonine.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.510
Octopamine is the slave hormone.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:20.659
Serotonine is the bragging hormone.

00:18:20.659 --> 00:18:28.610
Simply to change this balance, the brain dissolves
and regenerates.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:35.860
Is there a lesson there, from this strange
game that the Lobster plays underwater?

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.770
Everything depends on the mindset.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.030
Mind — Set.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.230
The Lobster has the same strength.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.779
The same muscle.

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:46.779
The same limbs.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:47.779
The same size.

00:18:47.779 --> 00:18:50.950
But, how does it become a slave?

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.110
A runaway scamperer?

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.180
A coward?

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.180
Mindset.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:03.440
So, whether we are going to be able to do
something or not, is not decided by talent,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:10.080
it is not skill, it is not the basic structural
powers that we have.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.460
It is the mind that is controlling all this..

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:23.041
Like the Lobster undergoes transformation,
if you can reconstitute your brain, probably

00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:28.300
you can become the alpha Lobster in your sea
floor!

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.450
Don’t you think?

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.539
As a closing thought, we are still under the
sea, aren’t we?

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.520
This book that comes to mind when I see the
phrase “Under The Sea”..

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.860
We have all read this classic book — haven’t
we?

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.900
“20,000 Leagues Under The Sea”..

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.300
I read it with great gusto.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.700
This is where Nemo appears first.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.610
Not in the movies!

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.420
Captain Nemo!

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.860
Nautilus is the ship.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.860
The submarine.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.190
An amazing adventure.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.590
A great story.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.450
I fell for it.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.400
I watched multiple movies.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.390
I read many versions of the book.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:09.500
But, only very recently, seven or eight years
ago, I learned that it is not “20,000 Leagues

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.289
Under The Sea” straight down..!

00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:15.510
He has cheated us, Jules Verne.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:28.789
It is actually, “Under The Sea”, 20,000
leagues of travel.

00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:32.330
20,000 Leagues is nearly 1,00,000 kilometers!

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.330
Can you really go that far under water?

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.460
You will break through off the other end.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.840
We have been cheated!

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.750
I am not going to forgive him!

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.799
We will meet again, soon!

00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:53.179
Thank you!
