00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.780
While working with my students, we encountered
this book.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.980
It is called “The Sciences of the Artificial”.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.690
Authored by one Herbert Simon.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:18.259
We have seen a lot many definitions for the
word “Design”.

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.159
In this book, the author asks “Do you know
what Design is?” and answers with:- It is

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:35.550
the transformation of existing conditions…

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.510
into preferred ones!”

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.630
How profound!

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.760
How succinct!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:01:00.200
The transformation of existing conditions
into preferred ones!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:08.130
Namaste!

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.060
Konnichiwa!

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.829
In the Japanese world, design and design aesthetics
have always enjoyed a special respect.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:24.829
A special place.

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.240
We have talked about some concepts earlier
too.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:38.039
Today, we are going to see SEVEN Amazing Concepts,
identified by some special Words.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.170
That is what we are going to see today.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.110
First, this concept of Zen.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.580
A beginning.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.049
An end.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.969
A push and a pull.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.029
A yin and a yang.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:52.590
A balance.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.600
An unfinished nature.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.119
We have encountered these earlier.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.670
Even this brush stroke… starts and doesn’t
end.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.619
It is rough cut.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.490
They call it Shibumi.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.830
What is Shibumi?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:23.810
Being, without the pain, the unhappiness,
the struggle of becoming.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.960
The act of Being.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.980
If your design can reflect THAT sentiment,
you are achieving Shibumi.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.010
Understanding, rather than knowledge.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.290
And, that perfection should seem effortless.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.990
And, there should be honesty.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.010
I am sharing what exactly is!

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.230
There is a transparency and an honesty in
what I am showing you.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.910
All this together strive to make the viewer
the artist!

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.650
Let me repeat it for you!

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.650
Listen carefully!

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:22.020
A viewer who is enjoying a particular design,
… the viewer, becomes the artist!

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.500
That is the ideal called Shibumi.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.560
There are seven principles behind this.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.180
Let us look at them one by one!

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.300
The first one is called Koko.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.300
Austerity.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.760
A hermit performing penance won’t have an
iPhone in his hand.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.510
Because, he will only have what he needs.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.210
Absolute needs.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.350
And he will not have anything else that is
not part of his absolute needs.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.830
Omission.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.320
Exclusion.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.800
Rejection.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.180
Only what I need.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.180
Minimalist.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.100
The focus is on sparseness.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.520
The focus is to bring clarity.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.370
That is Koko.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.250
Almost spiritual in nature.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.160
This design philosophy comes directly from
their temples.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.960
You don’t need to go anywhere else, looking
for examples, except Google.com itself!

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.770
When you visit that website, you are shown
nothing.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.660
But, you know it can show you EVERYTHING.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.220
That is the beautiful balance of Google’s
design!

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.090
I know everything, but I will let you ask
me!

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:53.900
Compare this, this beautiful example of Koko
with… this is another website.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.130
Supposed to be a search engine.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.510
But, the moment you enter it, to the extent
of making you forget what you came looking

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.250
for,… it bombards me with so much content..

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.850
Thinking it is smart.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.190
Thinking it knows what I am looking for.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.190
This is anti-Koko.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.560
This is also called the Signal To Noise Ratio.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.980
How much beauty, how many meaningful messages,
versus, how many meaningless, irrelevant junk

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.980
and distraction.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.000
This is an important concept even in Electronics.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.540
How much Signal.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.970
How much Noise.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:44.050
So, if this is the message, this is good…
this is not that good….

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.080
this is getting worse… that’s too bad!

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.680
Too much noise..

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.830
I lose track of the original signal.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.740
So, this is anti-Koko.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.960
The next design philosophy that Shibumi tells
us about is called Kanso.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.040
Kanso is again related to Koko and it is simplicity
personified.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.590
We talked about the removal of the unnecessary,
didn’t we?

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.990
Along the same lines, we have “Less is More”.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.650
“Simple is Better”.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.150
If you want to convey or depict a specific
beauty or a particular utility, don’t overstate

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.660
it!

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.120
Say what is needed.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.330
Stop just a little short of a hundred percent.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.571
And let things take care of themselves.

00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:41.082
The best example that I consider for Kanso
is the iPod Classic.

00:06:41.082 --> 00:06:46.650
It appeared in the market exactly twenty years
ago.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.060
2001.. 2002..

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.000
When it came, it wasn’t the first music
player.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.550
It was available only in two colors, while
the others were available in many more colors.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.250
It had lesser storage capacity than the others.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.830
In fact, to delete a song, there was no button.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.040
You had to connect it to a computer.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.700
Features are FEWER!

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.490
But, they gave the best LISTENING experience.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.280
They focused on the Less is More philosophy.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.470
They focused on Kanso.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.790
Next we come to, Fukinsei.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.180
Fukinsei is asymmetry and imbalance.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.430
You get the feeling as if this is NOT supposed
to be standing, this is supposed to tip over

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:47.400
and fall, it is imbalanced, … The viewer
adds something in his or her mind and fills

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.270
it up.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:55.100
It is a collaborative creation between the
designer and the consumer.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.159
Nature is not symmetric.

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:05.970
If you look at anything in nature, in commonplace,
here and there in the world, it will NOT be

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.160
symmetric, if you look at it with exact measurements.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.150
It will not be rigid.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:19.810
So, that rigidity, that asymmetry, can we
embrace?

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.530
Can we be perfectly imperfect!

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.560
Can we celebrate that beauty of nature?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.290
So, take a look at this picture.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:39.690
Yes, beautiful flower, but compare this with..
this Fukinsei image.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.849
Same sunflower.

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:47.690
But, you see that we have followed the Rule
of Thirds and positioned it in an imbalanced

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.690
manner?

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.230
We have placed it in one corner of the grid?

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:58.260
Our mind is doing some magic to fill out the
rest of the space and providing the balance

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.470
we are looking for.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.470
Fukinsei.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:08.060
Again, another design philosophy from Shibumi.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.000
The next design philosophy is Shizen.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.950
This is drawn out of Nature.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:21.980
And strives to show it naturally as much as
possible.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.830
Show the colors of Nature.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.010
Show the twists and turns of Nature.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.960
Show the imperfections of Nature.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:36.390
Only in Mathematics, you can get straight
lines and correct dimensions and symmetry..

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:44.710
Bring the incompleteness of Nature into your
design, and respect that natural world.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.400
That is what Shizen says.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.560
Avoid manmade elements.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.260
Show it raw.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.580
Show it unpolished.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.390
As it is found in Nature.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.410
Just take a look at this as an example.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.370
This is the famous Rock Gardens of Japan.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.210
Zen Gardens, or Rock Gardens, they call it.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:09.130
If you need to stand a tall rock here, what
would our guys do?

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:15.800
They would polish it exquisitely smooth, probably
cut some lettering on to it, and stand it

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.800
up.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.610
It is so artificial.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:26.850
On the other hand, as it was in the mountains,
broken, imbalanced, chipped, affected by rain,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:33.480
having some holes here 
and there..

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.730
unearthed as it is, installed as it is…

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.740
THAT is Shizen.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.760
If you want to look at the world of design,
if I were to put up a word in my slide, and

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760
underline it like this…

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:51.930
Do you like this, … or like it better if
it is underlined like this?!

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:57.920
Do you realise that there is some raw beauty
in the second this?

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.850
That is Shizen.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.160
Yugen!

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.670
Yugen is … profoundness.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.260
This is carrying something much more than
just the design..

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.720
There are some inner meanings.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720
Some philosophies.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720
There is a backstory.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:27.240
If the design can make you think all this..,
if the artist is able to kindle that feeling

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.470
in you.. that is Yugen!

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:35.870
We have looked at many a Miss Universe, a
Miss World.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:41.900
But, do you agree that there is something
special about this photograph?

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.230
There is a lifetime of struggle..

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:55.770
There are a thousand stories — inspirational,
motivational, tragic, perhaps fun, stories..

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.820
Do you see the mockery in her eyes?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:06.260
If an image or a design makes you take pause,
and think about the past…

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:13.250
We have reached here, but what are all the
things that transpired before I reached here?

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.390
If we can make you think that, Yugen!

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.430
Similarly, we have reached here.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.529
What is the future?

00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:21.060
Where next?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.120
What is going to happen?

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.709
If we can give that sense of expectation,
Yugen!

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:30.320
The universe is a very large, very interesting
place.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:36.470
We are trying to squeeze and fold it into
two dimensions.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.149
But, we fail.

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:42.230
Because, we do not imbibe Yugen in it.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.490
We need to bring a historical reflection into
it.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.240
Almost spiritual.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.120
A sense of mystery.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.339
Yugen!

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:56.120
Then we come to Datsuzoku.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:05.390
If you want to look for a one-word equivalent
for it, it is the Design of the Unexpected.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.790
A break from the daily mundane quotidian routine…
a parting from that daily habit…

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:17.470
You don’t need to see the same thing here
that you see everywhere else!

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.950
Something unusual, not ordinary, something
different!

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.170
Something off the beaten track.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.210
Something that breaks convention.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.210
That philosophy?

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.670
That is Datsuzoku.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.800
Some people complain of the Creative Block,
inability to be innovative…

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.459
It seems all they need to cure them of it
is two pills of Datsuzoku!

00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:46.300
Because, when you start thinking off the beaten
track, innovation and creativity simply emerge,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.300
it seems.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.240
At MIT, a very famous architect by name Frank
Gehry.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.240
They engaged him.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.990
They said, “We want a building.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.990
Make it interesting!”.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.130
“Oh, okay”, Gehry said.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.970
“Interesting is what you asked for.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:04.840
Interesting is what you shall get!” and
he went about designing this interesting building!

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.390
Look at that!

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.620
No straight lines!

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.950
It looks like a crumpled Pappad.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.980
In fact, most buildings look the same from
the front and the back.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.040
I will show you the back of the building.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.840
This is the back of the building!

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.990
So, Frank Gehry said, “I will introduce
cylinders, I will introduce reflections, I

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:32.560
will introduce steel, I will introduce red
brick, I will make them not right angles,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.990
but inside, I will have an auditorium, I will
have a gym, I will have a hostel.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:44.339
And that is the Frank Gehry — created Stata
Center in MIT.

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:45.950
Datsuzoku.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.250
The design of the unexpected.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:54.110
Finally, we come to Seijaku.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.399
Seijaku is calmness.

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:57.399
Solitude.

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:58.399
Quietness.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:07.020
But, beyond all that, it is active calmness,
energetic quietness…

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:12.060
So, what is this active calmness, energetic
quietness?

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.700
An action has happened.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.899
The next is yet to begin.

00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:19.560
The quietness in that gap!

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.450
An episode has ended.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.450
The next hasn’t started yet.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.450
The calmness that comes in between.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:28.550
A particular activity has ended.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.820
You reach a crescendo.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.620
You reach a climax.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.100
You pause there for a moment.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.889
We have climbed this small mountain.

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:37.380
How far we have come!

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.870
How much farther to go!

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.950
That half-breath we take while we pause?

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:41.950
That moment!

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.630
In a dance, when the dancer is en pointe!

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.529
The moment she pauses at the tip of her toes!

00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:59.569
In a musical movement, the power of the pause,
the power of the silence….

00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:01.269
…. …. THAT silence!

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:03.480
That is Seijaku.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:10.100
If you design an interface, or a series of
interfaces, or a storyboard, for an App or

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:17.920
a product, you can actually look for such
moments, and you can give that empty space,

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.411
that freedom, … That … Hey, I have nothing
to see, and you are making me think, and what

00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:24.411
am I thinking?

00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:26.920
I am thinking about what I have achieved till
now.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.160
Thank you!

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.070
That is Seijaku.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.910
So then, we have Koko.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.950
We have Kanso.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.980
We have Fukinsei.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.649
We have Shizen.

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:42.110
We have Yugen.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.350
We have Datsuzoku.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.450
And finally, that active calmness.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.270
We have Seijaku.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:58.339
These comprise what the Japanese call the
Shibumi Seven.

00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:03.639
By the way, these things that look like hieroglyphics..

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:07.290
Kanji script they call it…

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.600
Not our Kanchi!

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.510
There is one problem though, with this script.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.400
We kind of tend to see…

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400
Ah.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400
this one looks like a house..

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.430
This should be representing a house?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.430
Looks like a snake.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.790
Is this a dragon then?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.990
What we end up doing is, we color the word,
add a picture to it, and we try to draw meaning

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.360
from it.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.840
In fact, in 1959, Kennedy himself committed
this mistake.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.950
This is what he said.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:38.510
Crisis — “The Chinese representation of
that word, is made of two components, he said.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.450
One that means Danger and another that means
Opportunity.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.240
If you combine both, it is a crisis!

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:50.860
So, you may see a crisis as a danger, but
you can also sense that there is an opportunity..

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.429
It is all in your hands.” he said.

00:17:53.429 --> 00:17:54.460
It was a pretty motivational speech.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.210
But, the Chinese couldn’t stop laughing
after hearing this.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:06.340
That is because, the Chinese Script and the
Japanese Script that is derived from it, simply

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.990
do not follow all such nonsense.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.559
Do you know what crisis really means?

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.630
It is making your sister cry.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.530
If you make your sister cry…

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.530
Sis..

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.530
Cry..

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.900
Crysis… crisis… you are in crisis.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.350
How silly this deduction sounds!?

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:32.669
That is exactly how foolish it is to say Danger
and Opportunity form Crisis in Japanese!

00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:38.290
Because, that is not how the letters and the
ideograms are split up..

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.240
I learned this just yesterday!

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.300
Anyway, thank you, we will meet again!

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.670
How do we meet again?

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.290
We are following that Pi Sequence.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.809
And, this will be our sequence for the month
of April!

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:51.980
Thank you!
