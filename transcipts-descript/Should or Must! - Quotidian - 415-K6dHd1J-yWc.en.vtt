00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:10.430
All of us, I am sure, know these two words.
Should. And Must. And, I think most of us,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:19.270
till today, we have been using that quite
interchangeably. Only a slight difference

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.060
between the two. For example… Should — I
should watch the Vikram movie. It is a good

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.620
idea to watch it. But, Must? It is a duty.
It is a rule. It is going to be disadvantageous

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.020
if I don’t follow it. I must take an umbrella.
For it is raining. Should. Must. Not too much

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.579
of a difference to write home about. Yes?
So, we SHOULD go. It is getting late.. You

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.079
SHOULD watch the Game of Thrones. You MUST
have a passport to travel. You MUST be on

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.550
time for the exam. These two words.. The nuanced
difference between the meanings of these two

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:15.240
words.. A lady has written a book on it. And,
that’s what we are going to see today! A

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.000
full book!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.900
Namaste! Four hundred and fifteen! Should
we do it? Must we do it? Let’s anyway get

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.900
in.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:41.710
This is the name of that book. The Crossroads
of Should and Must. Find and Follow your Passion.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:51.310
That’s what this book is about. I fell in
love with everything about the book. Right

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:03.020
from the cover art. So, who is she? Her name
is Elle Luna… and, great orator. Inspirational,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:12.849
truly. Artist. Amazing! She’s even good-looking!
May even slip in as a Kollywood actor! And,

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.770
look at her signature! I loved even her signature!
Like four Ls next to each other. E. L. L.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:32.510
E. Elle Luna. She was an artist who went through
a slump in her career. And, she had a recurrent

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.820
dream. A room is featured in that room. And,
she goes in search of that room. That’s

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.530
what this book is about. Should and Must.
These two are quite different from each other.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.400
In her dictionary at least.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.910
Right in the first few pages of the book itself,
you encounter this. “It’s permission to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.629
UNLEARN everything you’ve ever been told
you SHOULD do, in order to LEARN what you

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:09.690
MUST!” Immediately bulbs started going off
in my mind.. For, just yesterday, we had seen

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:21.349
the Unlearn — Relearn cycle of Learning,
didn’t we?! So, I decided to jump in, immediately.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:30.720
She starts by telling, first, take a pulse
check. Where are you!? If you are doing a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:40.099
Job, you are on a nine to five chase. You
come. You go. You do work. You get paid. That’s

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:47.000
what you are in. Some of you may be in the
Career-zone. In the Career-zone, you are improving

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.740
every day. You are learning a little more.
You are creating opportunities for yourself.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.430
I am getting better at what I do. And, I progress
step by step. Like the LinkedIn logo conveys.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:14.080
But, there’s a third word which is probably
a lot more important, and that, is your Calling.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.290
Your purpose. That famous Ikigai. The reason
you think you’ve been put on earth for.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:31.680
They call it “The World’s Expert in Being
Me”.. Who am I? I am the world’s expert

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:41.300
in being me! So, like that, are you in that
kind of zone? That is Walt Disney’s card?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:53.530
Where did his career stop and where did his
life start? No! He didn’t do work. His life

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:03.900
WAS his work! My life is my message, said
Mahatma Gandhi. Are you in that zone? Are

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:13.220
you doing a Job? Are you pursuing a Career?
Or, are you living your Calling? Get that

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.660
sorted out first.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.790
For, this Should-dilemma… I have to do it.
I have been asked to do it. It is my responsibility.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.291
It has become my duty. All those are Shoulds.
I should. I should be there ten o clock. My

00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:40.289
class starts. My work starts. I shouldn’t
do that. The society prevents me. There is

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:50.610
such a din made by these Shoulds. But, the
Must? It stays alone, showing one direction,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:58.789
weakly, but ringing in your brain constantly,
that is your personal motive force — that’s

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:05.740
the must. And, what should your life goal
be? Blow all the Shoulds away. Pursue the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:14.960
single bright Must that is still standing.
You Must chase it. You Should drop the Shoulds,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.229
you Must chase the Must.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:27.389
This person resembles the villain from the
Aadukalam movie! But, I hear his name is Gurdjieff.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:35.530
This Turkish saint called Gurdjieff… the
Sadguru calls him the Rascal Saint, go check

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:44.509
it out on YouTube… The Rascal Saint. He
comes up with a beautiful philosophical koan.

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.259
He asks his disciples, his followers, this
interesting question. “A person gets jailed.

00:06:50.259 --> 00:07:02.250
What should he do first, to successfully come
out of jail?” Very interesting answers come

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:11.720
out. One of them says his first task should
be to test the strength of the metal bars.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.660
Another says testing the soil for firmness
might be a good idea. Another proposes that

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.650
he should first try and understand what kind
of key will open the lock. And, what about

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:27.610
befriending the jailor who oversees the prison?
And so on and on, they pour forth their ideas.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:35.740
But, Gurdjieff says, the first thing a person
who is imprisoned in a jail should do, so

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:44.410
that he stands a chance to come out of the
jail is to realise he is imprisoned! He has

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:50.479
to internalise the thought that he is stuck
inside a prison, and only afterwards, everything

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:58.470
else follows! If you don’t even realise
you are in a jail, of a job, of a career,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.840
you can’t pursue your calling.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:10.510
Remember? We saw the Shoulds? I am sure each
of you would have been in situations like

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:19.930
these. I have been. You should never _______.
You should always ________. You should know

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:31.670
better than to ________. You should not _________.
These are things that we have heard, from

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:38.760
when we were tiny tots, … all the way till
yesterday, we keep hearing these sentences.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:50.440
What others place on us as expectations. So,
Elle Luna, the author, she says, “I also

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:59.580
faced those. But, one day, I started asking
questions. I wrote them all down, these Shoulds,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:07.240
in pieces of paper. I put them all up on the
wall. And then, I started asking, boldly,

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.080
frankly, but respectfully… I asked three
questions.”

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.660
“Where did you come from? Where did you
begin? Why did you choose me? Whose arrow

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:24.580
is this, that is coming towards me? Who did
you think I was, when you chose to come to

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.850
me? Where did you come from?” These Shoulds?
They would run away from you the moment they

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.890
hear you asking these questions, the author
says.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:38.820
Here is another question. “Are you still
true for me? You came to me thinking I was

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:46.830
somebody. But, I am changing! I have become
somebody else? Are you still true for me?

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:55.330
Are we a right match? I have changed. There
was another guy that came with you, yesterday,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:02.320
and I changed because of it. Am I still relevant
for you? Are you still true for me? Will you

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.580
be true?”

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:11.230
And then, the third question. “Do I want
to keep holding on to you?” A little child

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:18.370
hangs on tightly to ANYTHING that even LOOKS
like a finger. I don’t know why. There is

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:25.800
that reflex reaction. A sense of belonging
perhaps. A sense of safety and security. But,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:33.880
one day the child realises, “Why am I holding
on to you!? Force of habit? Wait!” Only

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:43.060
when it releases the hold, only when the unlearning
happens, you realise that it is an unnecessary

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:50.570
Should. You realise it is an irrelevant Should.
And that’s when the doors open for Must.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:11:03.839
Can you tell me her name? Yes! Marie Kondo.
This Marie Kondo, a Japanese woman, truly

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:11.430
inspiring, has authored many books, has even
run a TV series, all about the concept of

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:17.310
how to get rid of junk, and how to create
cleanliness and neatness at the home, at the

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:28.120
office. The Kon Mari method, people call it.
She made famous, an interesting phrase called

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:35.670
“Spark Joy”. You have a thing in your
hand. You have had it for ages. You see it

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:42.040
again. It is occupying space. It is wasting
your time. But, you haven’t thrown it away.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:50.930
Throw it away, she says. But, before throwing
it away, hold it in your hand, she suggests.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:12:04.889
“Appreciate it. And then, look inwards.
Do you feel the spark of joy? Does it spark

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:09.010
joy?” Look at her pose! She would be standing
like that, still. Body all keyed up. And,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:15.170
it would swell up and … a “Ting”…
There is even a video of her acting it out

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:21.970
on YouTube! The resonant power surging through
your body.. You feel good about it. Is that

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.950
the feeling you get? If it doesn’t spark
joy, whether it be because of nostalgia, or

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:33.410
because of its productive value, or because
of its daily utility value, whatever, does

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:40.550
it spark joy? If it doesn’t, place it in
front of you, thank it. Thank it for traveling

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:50.360
along the way till now. Forgive me. I am gonna
bid good bye now. That is how you let it go.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.550
And she says, we should be choosing what we
want to hold on to! Not what we want to get

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.280
rid of! Throw everything off! And, as they
are receding in the horizon, spot one and

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:07.450
ask it to come back, spot another and request
it to be retained! Bid the others good bye!

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:15.839
Be choosy about what you want to retain! The
Kon Mari method. And, I would like to draw

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:20.980
a connection between this Kon Mari method
and the Should-Must that Elle Luna talks about.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:29.500
We could use the Kon Mari method to get rid
of our Shoulds!

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.940
She talks about four reasons that will stand
in front of you, preventing you from pursuing

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.420
your Must. You have thrown the Shoulds away.
The Must is staring you in your face. But,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.620
how do you completely dedicate yourself to
the identified Must? What will the obstacles

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:51.149
be? Number one, is of course Money. She refers
to it from a Western standpoint. But, I think

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:55.580
it is relevant everywhere. She talks about
“Need to have” Money and “Nice to have”

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.160
Money. There is a limit below which you will
be financially destroyed! Unsustainable! And,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:10.550
there is a limit above which it is okay if
you don’t get more. Try to be between these

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:17.709
two. Don’t cross those boundaries. As far
as it involves Money, first finalise this,

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:21.270
and then go in pursuit of your Must.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:26.500
The second thing she talks about as an obstacle
is Time. “I have no time at all”. “I

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:35.570
will get around to doing it after I retire”.
“I will do this after my children grow up”.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:42.560
These are akin to saying, I will do it after
the waves in the seashore die down! For Luna,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.410
do you know when she decided to suddenly quit
her Silicon Valley designer job and become

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:59.699
a freelance artist and author? She used to
live in this room. She had set up some videos

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:06.389
and cameras as part of her studio design.
To take timelapse photos, etc. One day, by

00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:13.480
chance, she had come back from work, and the
camera was silently operating. She looks around,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:23.300
takes in the room, there is the dog that does
what dogs do to their masters, and then she

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.930
picks up her brushes, paint, and starts painting.
In the window in the background, one could

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:36.830
see the sunlight slowly failing, growing dark,
and she is still painting. It is night. The

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:43.529
moon is up. She is still painting. And then,
that timelapse continues into the morning.

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:52.199
And she stretches herself. Yawns. And she
is still painting. And then, she picks up

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:58.509
her bag, and walks out to her office. Only
a few days later, when reviewing the videos,

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:02.899
she realises that there is a video shot like
this. She didn’t even realise this had happened.

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:11.290
She had been in Flow. When she realised she
had done it for one full night, without sleep,

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.889
without food, without any other distractions,
that is when she realises “Oh my god, I

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:23.269
need to dedicate more time for this!” and
the next day, she quits her job! So, create

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:30.520
time, even if it is ten minutes a day.., “What
did you do to serve your Must, today?” “What

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:36.040
food did you feed its infinite hunger?”
That should be the question you should ask

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.480
yourself every day.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.279
The third, of course, if there is a question
of Time, there is the question of Space too!

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:50.171
I don’t have space in my home! I don’t
have an audio/video studio. I don’t have

00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:56.470
a playground to pursue my game. I don’t
have a library shelf to put all the books

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:07.049
that I want to read. The space… But, Elle
says, the problem of Space is less OUTSIDE

00:17:07.049 --> 00:17:13.380
of you and more INSIDE of you! First, get
rid of all the things around you that you

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.530
retain because you want to do this, you want
to do that, and you want to do everything

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:22.630
else too! First get rid of those! Just as
you throw them out, right along with that

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.959
act, you will get space automatically created!
Try it!

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:32.169
And, finally, the fourth obstacle that will
stand in front of you, surely, is the Fear

00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:40.860
of Failure. That monster that chases you,
every time you want to perform, every time

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.760
you want to attempt something that you haven’t
done before, what will people say, will they

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.790
laugh, will the people who love you stop loving
you, these are the monsters that will chase

00:17:52.790 --> 00:18:00.030
you! And, she has a quote to share in that
context. Somebody once said, somebody famous

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:09.870
once said, “Fear kills more dreams than
failure ever will”. It is the FEAR factor

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:15.180
that leads to failure. It is not Failure that
leads us to the feeling of Fear. There are

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.054
too many, countless initiatives that are stopped
simply because of this Fear of Failure. The

00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:25.900
Englishmen have a word for this. They coin
words for everything, don’t they!? Fear

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:33.770
of Failure has a word for it. Atychiphobia.
I am not going to teach you the pronunciation.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.520
For the original pronunciation is different,
and you can go on the internet to get it.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.920
But, the first time I saw this word, after
I had just finished the book by Elle Luna,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:52.100
I told myself, I want to pronounce this word
like this! அட சீ போவியா!

00:18:52.100 --> 00:19:00.840
When that demon, the fear-of-failure demon
approaches me, that is how I want to pronounce

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.190
that word!

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:08.000
Anyway, for the closing thought, I would like
to close with a quote from that book. She

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.570
says, “There are Shoulds. And there is the
Must. Have you found your Must? Great! From

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:18.760
now on, the Should road, the Could road, the
One-Day road, the Someday road, should only

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:30.630
ever be taken in moderation, and on your way
to the Must road.” That thin straight road,

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.640
the Must road, .. is the important one. The
others are like little pitstops along the

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:42.910
way. Coffee points to perhaps occasionally
stop and have a sip. I would love to have

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:50.390
a cuppa with her! Let’s see what happens!
Thank you! Later today, we will be meeting,

00:19:50.390 --> 00:20:01.380
for Four Hundred and Sixteen! Thank you!
