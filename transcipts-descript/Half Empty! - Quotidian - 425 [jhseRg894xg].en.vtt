00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.270
This glass-story?

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.480
I am sure you all know it!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.980
There is a Glass of Water…

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.740
The Optimist says it is Half Full.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.740
The Pessimist?

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.720
Says it is Half Empty.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.170
The Realist walks in.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.210
He observes that it is a Glass with Water
in it.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.210
Nothing more!

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:35.520
At that time, a Sceptic comes and he quips:
Hey, are you sure there is WATER in that Glass?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.360
Is it GLASS by the way??

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.770
The Physicist comes.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.579
And he says there is nothing empty there..

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:53.469
It is a glass with water in liquid state in
the lower half, and probably air and vapour

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.140
in gaseous state in the upper half.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.740
The Mathematician comes.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.090
She says, the Glass is twice as large as it
needs to be!

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.790
At that time, .. Mom comes in and says, “Who
was it again??

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.382
Didn’t you know, if you drink water using
this tumbler, you need to return it to the

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:33.200
place it belongs?”

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.479
Namaste!

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.720
Four hundred and twenty five is about that
Glass of Water.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.260
Half-Empty..!

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.000
The Pessimist’s opinion.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.700
The thing is, the Internet, if you go looking,
is filled with all this positivist thought.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.420
Confidence, happiness-boosting, motivation,
belief, inspiration, enthusiasm, … they

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.180
just STUFF you with it!

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.969
Books of all kinds!

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:08.969
They abound!

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.660
From Norman Vincent Peale!

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.610
Titles like The Magic of Believing, How to
Stop Worrying and Start Living..

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.450
The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, Think
and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, .. in fact,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.780
there is a book with a title that says, “Your
Glass Is Half-Full!”

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.900
Turn in any direction, and you have a book
there waiting for you!

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.349
So many!

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.099
In fact, somebody has defined pessimism thus..!

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.990
Elbert Hubbard says, “A pessimist…

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.030
Who is he?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.031
He is a man who has been compelled to live
with an optimist”.

00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:53.590
You just need to stick around with an Optimist
for a period of time, and you will invariably

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.590
turn into a Pessimist.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.920
That is because, most of the time, that guy
will talk about impossible things, miraculous

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.040
things, all the time.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.360
Half of them won’t even come to be..!

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.510
So, this guy starts becoming a Pessimist simply
because of the close contact with an Optimist.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.909
In Pessimism, there is a special type… actually
a good type of Pessimism.. not the type this

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.800
lady is demonstrating, filled with paranoia
and trepidation.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.709
It is called Defensive Pessimism.

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.100
This person, Bob Knight, has written about
it in great detail.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.370
He is a basketball coach.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.459
And, not a plain-vanilla basketball coach
either!

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.970
He is one of the “winningest” basketball
coaches in NBA history.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.970
So many awards.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.970
Hall-of-Famer!

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.480
He, while talking about his coaching methodology,
underlines the Power of Negative Thinking!

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.390
“When I start planning for a game, we don’t
plan to win.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.150
We plan to not lose!

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.709
We just focus on where all it can go wrong!”,
he says.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:15.310
For according to his observations, most games,
they aren’t won on court, it seems.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.750
They are lost.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.449
One team screws up, and as a result, the other
one wins.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.840
Not because the other team played well!

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.020
“So, we sit down and evaluate where we can
go wrong and we just knock them off one by

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.160
one..”

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.419
The Power?

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.090
Of Negative Thinking!

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.930
This man is Hans Rosling.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.660
He is a scientist.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.940
A data scientist.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.890
In the Bill Gates’ list of hugely-recommended
books, his book, Factufulness, was prominently

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.890
featured.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:05:01.130
In the introduction to that book, Hans would
say, “I am not a Pessimist.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.100
I am not an Optimist either.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.169
I would like to look at myself as a Possibilist.

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.180
This ALSO is possible.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.190
This might ALSO happen.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.160
That is how I approach it!”, he says.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.970
His book is about Ten Reasons We’re Wring
About The World — And Why Things Are Better

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.970
Than You Think!

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:33.540
He talks about population, health, electronics,
technology progress, and so on, in the book.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.810
I strongly recommend you take a look at it.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.430
The same Bill Gates highly recommends another
author too.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.630
By name Vaclav Smil.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.580
This Vaclav Smil has written more than sixty
books!

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.810
He is a data-guy.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.630
Just flipping through this book, it will become
apparent how much he believes in the power

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.540
of data.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.380
Hans Rosling … Power of Visualisation.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.440
If you watch any of his TED Talks, that’s
what you will understand immediately.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.349
This man is more of a data scientist.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.539
He doesn’t really believe he can convince
you with Visualisations.

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.970
He expects you to be data-numerate.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.250
He eggs you on to come over, and swim in the
data!

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.751
The volumes of data he has peppered this book
with.

00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:26.620
He has written a book called “How The World
Really Works”.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.490
He talks about seven things in this book,
and this book too, comes strongly recommended

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.680
by Bill Gates.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.770
These are the seven things that are covered.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.940
One chapter talks about Fuel and how everybody
wants it to be replaced by Electricity, … and

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.630
our man says, “No, wait.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.850
Don’t expect anything to happen in a blink.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.380
It is going to take time.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.830
It will happen only very gradually.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.379
We can’t change our dependence on fossil
fuels overnight.

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:04.770
Just because we purchase an electric bike,
don’t expect the world to reflect that change

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.770
immediately!”

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.820
The next chapter is about fossil fuels and
its connection with the food you eat.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.500
Particularly the non-vegetarian food you eat.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.620
He piles the data up skyhigh.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.930
“Look at this.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.180
Look at the bread on your plate.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.479
The fish on your dining table.

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:26.600
The chicken.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600
The meat.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600
The barbecue.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
The beef.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.410
Do you know how much fossil fuel is spent
fishing for this?

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.020
Or hunting for it?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.229
Or growing it?

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:40.720
Feeding it?

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.389
Cutting it?

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:44.389
Transporting it?

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:45.500
Cooling it?”

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.129
The list is overlong!

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:53.330
Oh my god, you start wondering, should we
turn vegetarian instead!?

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.440
The next chapter is about four pillars of
civilisation.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:04.620
“If a country has to progress, … you can’t
just base it on progress you see in Whatsapp,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.030
the internet, artificial intelligence, and
so on.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.030
That’s not enough.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.610
Don’t think you have progressed, based on
those measurements!

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.580
Don’t think the world has dematerialised,
already!

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.590
Don’t foolishly think that what was on paper
has now become completely digital, and so

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.660
your job is done!

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.310
Even today, at a global level, for progress,
for civilisation to subsist, you need four

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.310
pillars.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.800
And only if you make enough of these four,
can you thrive.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.300
He talks about Steel, Cement, Plastics, and
Ammonia.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.890
Fundamental materials needed for construction,
for packaging, for agriculture.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.990
Back to basics!

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.140
You find yourselves shaken up.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.140
Ouch..

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.080
Are these what my focus should have been on
all along?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:51.470
And, I have been dabbling on unnecessary pursuits?!

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.050
And then, he talks about De-Globalisation.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.780
Too often, we get into this “globalisation
trap”…

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.120
That we should conduct all kinds of business
only globally.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.120
That we should drop country boundaries.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.190
We should always sell our goods to anybody
in any place in any corner of the world…

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.120
But, hang on..

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.050
At one point..

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.779
(Particularly Covid.. this book was published
post-Covid!)…

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:27.279
when Covid hit us.. we realised that 70% of
rubber gloves for world consumption… and

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.490
an even higher percentage of respirators…

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:37.720
they were made in, not one country, not one
state or city, one FACTORY!

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:44.570
Everything was being manufactured in one factory,
and was being transported world-wide.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:52.420
A Covid pandemic reminded us how tenuous,
how weak, how thin that ice was.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:59.080
We woke up to the realisation that we should
manufacture this ourselves.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.060
We have to MAKE!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.940
That realisation was reached.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.000
And, the author says, we have reached the
point of peak globalisation.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.759
We may no longer be greedy to global for everything,
he says.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:25.750
And then, he talks about viruses, solar flares,
and all kinds of “doomsday scenarios”.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:34.180
If you watch the Contagion movie, you will
see the exact same sequence of events from

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.180
the Covid pandemic!

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:41.050
And, very similarly, a movie called Knowing,
talks about the real and present danger of

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:49.580
a solar flare disrupting all telecommunication
in the world.. for an extended period of many

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.580
days!

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.580
How many deaths!

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.580
How much disruption!

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.230
Economies can be brought down to their knees!

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:02.400
So, are these never to ever happen again?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.930
Or, is the next pandemic just around the corner?

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.610
Will we be ready, if one arrives?

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.910
Nothing can really be avoided.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.810
Risk-free is simply impossible.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.430
Don’t even hope for it.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.730
All you can do, with all these technologies
and innovations?

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.880
Is just mitigation of risk.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.350
Management of risk.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.019
Prepare yourself well for that, he says.

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:34.050
And then, he talks about that little pale
blue dot we call home.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:39.690
Just because some crackpot talks about taking
everybody to Mars, don’t fall for it!

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:47.420
For it to be a practical facility available
commercially, within the purchasing power

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.410
of common man, it is going to take ages..

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.700
Not in our lifetime..

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.980
Probably centuries, he says.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.870
So, take care of this place.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.490
That little lifestyle change that you do,
don’t stop to wonder how that little thing

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.389
is going to impact the global scale..

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.589
Most of us make that mistake.

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:08.410
Two things we make.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:14.330
The first mistake we make is we think our
contribution is too small in the grand scope

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.370
of things.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.370
Sorry.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.370
No!

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.250
The second mistake we make is.., Hey, not
in my lifetime..

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.900
The earth isn’t going to simply become uninhabitable
in my lifetime…

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.310
So, why should I bother…!

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.240
So, we lack this long-range thinking..

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.660
We lack scale thinking too.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.480
If thousand people get together, and perform
small acts… like squirrels..

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480
like sparrows…

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480
We lack that thinking..

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.779
So, he advises us, take care!

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:53.920
And, finally, as a warning chapter, he talks
about the Apocalypse on one side.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.519
Probably nuclear war, probably bio war, probably
Covid, a stronger version..

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:06.440
And on the other side, he talks about AI truly
becoming a global entity..

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.080
A Singularity.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.220
Where AI invents AI..

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.850
And starts getting infinitely better, and
more powerful, and hopefully benign!

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.310
He talks about that.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:25.779
So, to sum it all up, yes, all this is going
to happen in this world.

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:27.600
Progress will keep happening.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.490
Setbacks will keep bothering.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.899
Occasionally, we will face seemingly insurmountable
difficulties..

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:45.910
And, occasionally, near-miraculous advances
in technology will happen too..

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.269
Technology will save the day, he says!

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:55.680
This other book I chanced upon, this ALSO
talks about Pessimism.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.730
The title of the book is, “The Psychology
of Money”.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:04.149
Something I don’t know much about.

00:14:04.149 --> 00:14:08.160
And, I am hence not going to talk about MONEY
here.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.399
But, a chapter in this book..

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:18.680
I think the 17th chapter, talks about the
Seduction of Pessimism.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.791
In the matters of money?

00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:23.660
The Pessimist, the Doomsayer, the guy who
talks about collapses and destructions and

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.120
complete utter disasters?

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.160
He has a special place..

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.420
Everybody praises him, says the author.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:35.380
And, why this seduction?

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.829
Particularly in the matter of money?

00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:40.009
Well, the author has three reasons why.

00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:48.209
The first is, even if it is a meteor crashing
into Earth, it will perhaps happen in some

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:50.449
corner of the world.. but, money?

00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:51.449
Is ubiquitous..

00:14:51.449 --> 00:14:52.449
Present everywhere..

00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:56.899
If something affects one person, it ends up
affecting everybody.

00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:02.940
The second thing he talks about that makes
money unique, that makes pessimism enjoyable,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:10.920
is the prediction game the analysts, economists,
the Wall Street watchers get into.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.500
With half-baked information and dangerous
half-knowledge.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.600
They start talking about scenarios, eventualities,
conditions, results, situations!

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.660
And, they miss out on one thing…

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:27.920
When predicting something, because of your
act of prediction, it could wake up and move

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.470
in a different direction!

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:40.899
A cricket ball has been hit by the batsman,
you chase the ball, that is predictable.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:48.100
A rabbit starts running, and the dog starts
chasing the rabbit..

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.740
Is that predictable?

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.740
Of course not!

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.810
Because, every move the rabbit makes, the
dog adjusts!

00:15:54.810 --> 00:16:00.339
But, every adjustment the dog makes, the rabbit
readjusts!

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:03.060
So, it is a dynamic game!

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.579
And, finally, the third reason why it is seductive?

00:16:07.579 --> 00:16:11.300
Good things take time..

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.769
They are glacially slow..

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:20.570
In the past hundred years, there have been
amazing leaps forward, improvement really

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.570
worth talking about.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.040
Why isn’t it apparent?

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040
That’s because, nobody writes about it..

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.490
But, one percent drop in the share price of
some particular stock, it becomes red…

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.490
it becomes…

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.490
read!

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:42.319
So, bad news spreads fast, and that’s again
why pessimism is seductive!

00:16:42.319 --> 00:16:45.870
He also talks about one Iron Law of Economics.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:55.120
He says, “Extremely good and extremely bad
circumstances rarely stay that way for long

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:06.900
because supply and demand adapt over time
in hard-to-predict ways”.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:12.770
And finally, talking about the uses of Pessimism,
there is one “Mega Benefit” we need to

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.770
talk about.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.520
If you can channelise it correctly…

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.439
In Christianity, what was Pessimism?

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:23.490
It was about the Fall of Man!

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.140
From a perfect heavenly Garden of Eden, Adam
and Eve are ejected because of their primal

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.140
sin.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.150
And, to escape that sin is your job on earth.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.150
Prepare for Heaven.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.150
Atone for your sins.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:38.720
In The Bhagavad Gita, just know, you are most
probably going to be let down, and so, shed

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:48.200
your ego, quit your desires, focus on the
task at hand, don’t expect the fruits of

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.330
your work!

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.130
What did The Buddha say?

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:56.610
He said, “Living is Suffering!

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.650
Not just once..

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:58.650
Multiple times.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.650
Samsara Sagara..

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.830
You are going to keep suffering..

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:03.960
Break out!

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960
Nirvana!

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.960
Moksha!”

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.020
That is how he took us forward!

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:15.049
So, attachment, suffering, living, attachment,
.. that was his train of thought.

00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:24.320
When they took the essence of living, and
instead of looking at it as, “Why Me!?”,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:32.299
they generalised it, universalised it, and
said, “Why Us?!” and there they were able

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:39.270
to create religions that stood the test of
time!

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.270
Closing thought!

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.910
When I look at this glass of water…

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:50.419
we brought in a lot of different perspectives
from different kinds of people.

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:56.059
Two important takeaways occurred to me though,
and I wanted to share them with you.

00:18:56.059 --> 00:18:59.660
The first one is: “Hey, drink it man!

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.250
Don’t just sit there thinking about it!

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.740
If you are thirsty, DRINK!

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.659
Have a bias for ACTION!

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:08.690
Jump in!

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.890
Drink it!”

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:18.610
The other bias that we need to have is: “If
it were dirty water, you have the power to

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.360
empty it..

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:29.330
If it were top class filter coffee, hey, you
have the power to actually refill it!

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:34.020
Have the bias towards that growth mindset..

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:40.330
Don’t just mope, telling yourself that this
is what you have been blessed/cursed with!

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.330
What can you do?

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.330
Dirty?

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.330
Can you empty it?

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.410
Is it good?

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.030
Can you refill it?

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.340
Yes, you can!!”

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.890
That would be my closing thought!

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.540
Let us meet next week!

00:19:53.540 --> 00:20:00.410
Thanks a lot!
