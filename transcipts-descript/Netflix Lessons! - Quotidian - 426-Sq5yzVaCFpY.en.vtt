00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.470
He had fought long and hard, against that
villain.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.859
He had been fighting for the past seven movies!

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.770
And, only towards the end, he realises, that
perhaps he needs to die to kill the villain.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.740
It is almost as if a part of the villain resides
inside of him…

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.500
Just when he realises that, and kills all
the dinosaurs in the neighbourhood, in one

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:37.280
hidden corner of the room there is a large
egg and that cracks open and a dinosaur head

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.320
peeps out.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.930
This boy, he has been going around and there
has been a voice helping him all along..

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.880
A doctor has been helping him all this while..

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:58.140
And in that final moment, that is when he
learns that the doctor is a dead man!

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.649
The doctor who has been helping him is himself
dead.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160
This boy has been seeing dead people!

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.580
He opens the scroll..

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.240
He had gone to great pains to procure this
scroll.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.630
This Dragon Scroll.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.009
He unfurls it, only to find out that nothing
is written inside it!

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:37.110
It is likely that spoilers such as these may
spill, over the next twenty minutes..

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.380
You’ve been warned!

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.799
Netflix!

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:54.960
Watching Netflix, … watching on Netflix,
… are there any lessons we can learn?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.189
Let’s take a tour!

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:09.300
Only when I stepped out of my login, and logged
in as my sister, I realised that Netflix doesn’t

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.680
have one thumbnail image for every series
or episode or movie.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.519
See HOW MANY images he has created for Stranger
Things!

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:28.319
They keep experimenting it seems, because
that thumbnail is that one moment, that rare

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.790
fleeting chance, when you are hurriedly scrolling
for your next entertainment fix..

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.070
“Can I catch your attention!?

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.440
Probably you like horror, let me make blood
drip..

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.080
Probably you like that actor, let me put that
actor in the forefront..

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.080
That actress?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.100
This background?”

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.819
They keep playing, they keep experimenting.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.100
That first look..

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.260
How beautifully can that be made?

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.110
How attention-grabbing can it be set up?

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:13.050
They spend so much time and effort and money
perfecting this, it seems.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.390
This is the product of a company.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.180
These are logos of a particular suite of products
from that company.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.180
Office Suite…

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.590
(Actually, this is our own company!

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.590
Zoho!)

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.000
They went through a logo revamp recently..

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.790
Changing the icons that represent those products.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.819
That’s all we did.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:38.260
Along with it, we did launch so many other
features, but… nobody really talked about

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.550
those features.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.970
They kept saying, “Wow, the logos are amazing”.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.820
“Wow, the icons are eye-catching..

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.700
This is so modern!”

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.700
First impression…

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.960
On their mobile phone, on their computer,
that first impression this logo creates seems

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.810
to impute good value, trust, lot of feel-good
warmth in the user’s mind.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.849
Take this product, for example.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.330
It is called Carvaan.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:20.009
It is nothing but a thumb-sized drive, the
USB drive and a speaker.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.009
That’s ALL.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:31.370
But, the color they have chosen, the matte
glint, the brushed metal, the sepia-toned

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.690
body, no sharp edges, that curvature, that
is what has added value to this product.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.490
That first look, the instant attention it
grabs, that makes you think this product is

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.490
trustworthy.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.220
And, I am not going to elaborate on the countless
number of victims to the “Looking great

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.509
on photo, will make for a great life-partner”
trap!

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.990
This effect has a name!

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.070
It is called the Aesthetic-Usability Effect.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.380
Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing
design as design that’s more usable!

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.380
What else does Netflix teach us?!

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.430
I didn’t like it one bit, but I still watched
it till the end..

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.430
The Great Wall.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.280
About a story spun around the Great Wall of
China.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.550
The moment I started watching it, I got the
hang of the plot.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.419
If they had shot the Avatar movie in China,
this would have been the result.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.680
If they had set the Edge of Tomorrow movie
in China, this is what it would have looked

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
like.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.040
I was able to predict what was going to happen.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.930
I watched this movie too!

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.190
You may have watched it too!

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.320
From Christopher Nolan.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.230
I could hardly make head or tail of it.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.230
Where is he starting?

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.230
What is the ending?

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.710
Even the name itself is palindromic.. if you
can get the concept behind it.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.139
Too complicated.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.850
But, recently I watched The Batman movie.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.850
Wow!

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:09.150
Those riddles that The Riddler keeps throwing
at The Batman.., and just when The Batman

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.770
himself is about to crack it, I am able to
actually crack it too.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.460
It seems like I am part of the movie.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.310
The movie takes me along!

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.520
That beautiful sweet spot?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.180
Between that world I am clueless about and
that other world that is boringly ordinary

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.660
and lucidly plain?

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.389
That sweet spot in between?

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.509
If you can capture that, you got us!

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:35.569
The users?

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:36.630
The viewers?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.070
Will stick with you!

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.479
Take, for example, this common Captcha you
must have seen.

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.240
Haven’t you been irritated?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.000
Haven’t you felt aggravated?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.520
But, this same challenge, when presented like
this?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.600
Instead of making it dead-simple like this…

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.040
This is simple, all I need to do is just click!

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.040
Magical!

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.139
Instead of doing this, when they make it a
game…

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.630
Please click each image containing a toy rabbit!

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.280
It is not enough if it is a rabbit..

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.430
It has to be a rabbit TOY!

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.840
It can’t be a teddy bear either.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.710
It has to be a RABBIT toy!

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.849
When such a challenge is presented, .. my
mind goes, “Wow, I am competing against

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:17.849
a computer!

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:18.849
I have to prove I am not a robot!”

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:19.849
That extra push?

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:20.849
Is beautiful.

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:21.849
That is the Doherty Threshold.

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:22.849
We have encountered this earlier too.

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.280
Productivity soars when a computer and its
users interact at a pace (&lt;400 ms) that ensures

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.080
that neither has to wait on the other.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.000
The computer is operating at a certain pace.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.250
We are operating at another pace.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.560
One of them should not wait for the other.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.090
Similarly, a product is progressing at some
pace.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.960
Your mental understanding is progressing at
another pace.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.150
They have to be kinda alongside.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.530
Or else, one is going to ditch the other and
move on.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:03.129
That’s what Netflix does, when it comes
up with those movie plots.

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:05.930
By the way, this progress bar!

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:11.710
That thing that shows you how far you have
come, how much more there is to go, … Netflix

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.840
ran a series of ads using JUST THAT!

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.250
How something that starts as a heist, a robbery,
how that ends up in a REVOLUTION!

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:25.900
When they see us… to When we find the system
guity..

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.819
The Crown… we realise all families have
drama…

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:34.529
A turning point every step of the way!

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:35.529
You start it simple.

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:37.120
But, get a grip on how much drama awaits you!

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.820
It is just one story away!

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:44.420
That was the reverberating message across
all those beautiful ads they launched.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.459
The same thing we see with progress bars in
onboarding interfaces.

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:53.260
If you see this interface, .. you start wondering..

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:59.740
Oh my god, I have to do all this, and I have
to slowly go to hundred percent…

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.529
But, the same challenge, if you present it
like THIS…

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:14.700
“You are already twenty-five-percent in,
for just having coming in!”

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:20.670
The remaining tasks are the same between the
two interfaces, but when you start with a

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.520
“headstart”… that is another beautiful
way to catch the user!

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:33.810
Too many times, Netflix has successfully cajoled
me into watching movies that I had dropped

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.320
after watching just partially.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.570
Because, it has that “Continue Watching”
list.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.450
He has even stooped so low as to send me email!

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.589
“Hey, remember that series you didn’t
binge watch completely?

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:45.760
There are new twists in the plot!

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.160
Come on, join up!”

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.779
This, again, has names.

00:09:51.779 --> 00:10:06.690
The Goal-Gradient Effect says “The tendency
to approach a goal increases with proximity

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.020
to the goal”.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.330
The Zeigarnik Effect says, “People remember
uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.330
completed tasks”.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.170
You may not remember the stuff you didn’t
start at all.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.860
It will hang around in your ToDo list..

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.310
Your ToWatch list.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.310
You may not remember the stuff you watched
and enjoyed.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.310
Done.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.310
Closed.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.649
Struck off the ToDo list.

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:30.779
But, you WILL remember the ones you left dangling.

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:36.370
That psychological theory has been used to
good effect by Netflix.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.450
Am guessing you have watched, or at least
HEARD OF this.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.680
Not sure if you ENJOYED it though.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.760
As part of a serial called Black Mirror, .. one
particular episode was called Bandersnatch.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.970
We have talked about this too, in a different
context.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:11:01.160
This Bandersnatch movie or episode was special
for one important reason.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:09.750
It was special because every few minutes it
would stop and throw a Yes-No on screen.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.750
Or..

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.750
A Left…

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.750
Right..

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.750
Or..

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.750
Take it or Leave it..

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.750
Questions will keep coming at you!

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:25.790
The player or the watcher or the viewer or
the user has to click using an Apple TV remote

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:31.530
or play it on the computer, or a special remote,
and guide the characters along!

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:37.800
You can’t kick your heels up, eat popcorn,
and just dumbly watch!

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.900
Look at this flowchart!

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.399
This many endings were possible!

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:47.330
Depending on the turns you took, depending
on whether you plunged the knife or not, depending

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:54.040
on whether you drank the poison or not…But,
you know what?!

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.339
It was a total failure!

00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:02.900
Nobody wanted to sit.. lean forward.. and
play the game…

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.040
They just wanted to sit back and enjoy.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.760
This too is an Effect.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.870
In the laws of usability, this is an important
one.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.920
Take a look at this interface.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.350
Pricing interface from our famous Microsoft.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.640
Yes, he is trying to make a good sale..

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.260
He is accosting students, home-bound folks,
business folks, solo buyers…

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.560
He is trying to sell.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.560
Yes.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:40.360
But, you are frozen, you are paralysed, because
of the options given.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:46.209
On top of that, you have an Annual versus
Monthly dilemma too!

00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:47.209
Too much choice!

00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:54.070
I remember walking away hungry once, when
I had a superspread of various icecream options

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.430
in front of me!

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.430
Yes!

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.160
Compare that, with this interface.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.680
Just three schemes.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.750
Probably the previous one is better for the
user.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.340
But, the user doesn’t understand that.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.960
Because of this Effect.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.960
Hick’s Law.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:20.360
The time it takes to make a decision increases
with the number and complexity of choices.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:27.880
Don’t, with the noble intent of helping
me, spread too many choices in front of me!

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.410
Netflix learned that lesson after Bandersnatch!

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.180
Another thing that I learned…

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.540
I am going to show you three screens.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:46.420
Can you tell me if it is Netflix or Hotstar
or Amazon Primevideo?

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:56.921
Choice of TV Shows, Genres, Login to your
profile, and this famous interface where you

00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:58.470
scroll scroll select..

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:04.470
Each of us want to be different from the others,
don’t we?

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.769
Amazon doesn’t want to be like Netflix.

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:11.410
Netflix wants to stand apart from Disney Hotstar.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.410
But…

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:20.680
why are their search interfaces, their scroll
interfaces, their profile choosing interfaces,

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.380
just like the others?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:27.720
That too is because of a psychological effect.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:34.860
This, for example, is a beautiful, beautifully
done website.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.920
Except that…

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.100
it is a horizontal scrolling website.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.100
If you press the down-arrow, a popup will
come — alerting that you need to move to

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.540
the right instead.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.139
Why am I pressing a down arrow though?

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:55.500
Why did they have to show a pop up that it
is a rightward scrolling leftward scrolling

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.990
horizontal website?

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.140
It is because I am habituated.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.760
On the internet, if somebody is consuming
something through a browser, it has always

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.950
been top to bottom and bottom to top.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.100
And no other way.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.899
Not sideways scrolling.

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:12.899
So, this website, even though it is amazing…

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:14.600
it is a site about car-ride-sharing..

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.360
You see a beautiful car moving along..

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:28.300
In spite of that, this didn’t become famous
because usability sucked.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.860
And, why did it suck?

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.500
Because of Jakob’s Law.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.690
What does Jakob Nielsen say?

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.970
“Users spend most of their time on other
sites.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:45.230
This means that users prefer your site to
work the same way as all the other sites they

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.230
already know.”

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:54.120
Even if your hotel’s food is the best in
the world, they eat most of the team elsewhere.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:04.100
Even if you are the closest friend, they spend
most of their time with somebody else.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.260
Understand this..

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.800
I am not saying they eat at another hotel.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.529
They may be eating at home, they may be eating
at their friend’s place.

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:12.019
They may be dieting.

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.430
They may be eating at another hotel.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:21.029
All of that put together will always be more
than the time they spend eating at your hotel.

00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:23.860
I may be having a “Best Friend”.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:30.029
But, when I put all the other interactions
together, I will spend more time with the

00:16:30.029 --> 00:16:32.649
rest of them than with this “Best Friend”.

00:16:32.649 --> 00:16:34.089
Is it not?

00:16:34.089 --> 00:16:38.580
And, so, it is better to “be like the others”.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:46.851
When the whole world is doing a vertical scroll,
if you try a horizontal scroll, you are in

00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:48.339
trouble, my friend.

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:56.470
When you create a story, when you cut it up
into episodes, it is not random.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:03.500
They spend a lot of time at Netflix, thinking
about what should be in the Finale, what should

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.809
be in the Pilot.

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:06.809
Something special…

00:17:06.809 --> 00:17:08.049
There has to be a hooked ending.

00:17:08.049 --> 00:17:09.970
Only then they will come rushing for the next
season.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:15.780
In the pilot, in the first scene itself, you
should show an old chemistry professor as

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.140
a drug-peddler..

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:23.829
Only then, they will get hooked and allow
you a chance to tell your full story.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.620
They hook you.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.240
In the beginning and in the end.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.240
Oh.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.830
Not just the beginning and the end..!

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.580
Do you remember these scenes?

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.299
This scene for example is one of my most favourite
scenes.

00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:38.830
That Bella Ciao song..

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.510
This is where I heard it first.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.050
What jubilation and exuberance!

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:48.860
When they set eyes for the first time on the
piles of money!

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.150
Similarly, I got really enraged..

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.150
Tokyo…

00:17:54.150 --> 00:18:00.550
But, do I remember in which season, which
episode they happen?

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.590
I don’t.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.410
Do I remember anything else as graphically?

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.360
I don’t recall!

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.960
These two are special.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.150
And that is what Uber has internalised too.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:21.070
Uber understands that the experience is not
just the time you spend inside the car.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:29.650
From the time you start looking for a driver,
from the time you tell Uber that you want

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.429
to go from A to B, … from that moment, .. right
till the moment you rate the driver at the

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:37.020
end after everything is over, … there are
twelve, as many as fifteen touch points!

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.640
Can I give you a peak?

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.640
Can I give you a trough?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.690
Whatever it is or not, it shouldn’t be average.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.690
It should be memorable.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.740
The beginning.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.740
The end.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.650
And a peak or two in between.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:58.789
That is what every product creator, every
experience manager tries to get to their users.

00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:59.789
That has names too!

00:18:59.789 --> 00:19:03.179
Peak-End Rule — People judge an experience
largely based on how they felt at its peak

00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:05.840
and at its end, rather than the total sum
or average of every moment of the experience.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.430
The Serial Position Effect — Users have
a propensity to best remember the first and

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.230
last items in a series.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.710
They have researched it quite deeply and extensively.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.850
Memory is not the sum of an experience.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.150
Memory is not the average of an experience
either.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:29.020
A recent peak causes the peak to be a greater
factor in your memory than an early peak.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.289
Adding a second, equal peak doesn’t affect
your memory.

00:19:32.289 --> 00:19:37.539
A long peak causes the peak to be a greater
factor in your memory than a short peak.

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:43.500
A quick ramp-up to the peak causes the peak
to be a greater factor in your memory than

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.500
a slow ramp-up to the peak.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.919
And so on and on.

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:52.560
And finally, an improving trend at the end
improves the memory of the experience compared

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.990
to a worsening trend at the end.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.059
For, that is what gives you the opportunity
for a sequel.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:01.600
So much thought!

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:09.480
From this, we can too, while creating products,
while designing experiences, use the same

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.770
guidelines and rules.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:18.039
Coming to the Closing Thought, while researching
about Netflix, I came across…

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:20.090
The Netflix Book Club!

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.390
Have you heard of it?

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:31.330
This lady, Uzo Aduba, analyses and interviews
the author for every book that has been made

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.380
into a movie or a series in Netflix.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.570
This is an initiative FROM Netflix itself.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.220
This too… is a marketing principle.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.740
What principle?

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:54.230
Perhaps let us watch it in the next episode!

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.960
Thank you!
