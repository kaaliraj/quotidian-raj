00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.320
Near where I live, there is a shop like this
one. Udankudi Karuppatti Kaapi. If you check

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.429
that out on Wikipedia, you will notice that
Udankudi is actually a place where Karuppatti

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:25.430
Vellam (Black Jaggery) is available. But,
when I see it, I feel irrationally happy,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.189
because… "udan kudi" / "udaney kudi" - you
can drink it immediately perhaps? Instant

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.910
coffee perhaps?! - is the feeling I get.
The Need for Speed.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:01:11.610
Namaste! There is a movie titled "Her", starring
Joaquin Phoenix. 14th February! Tomorrow!

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:24.120
The future of love! A story about that! Came
out in the year 2014! In this, early in the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.550
movie, there will be a scene like this.&nbsp;
Basically, it is the hero, falling in love

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.250
with a computer. An intelligent agent in the
computer. He creates it a female. Asks her

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.479
what her name is. And, this conversation ensues.
She says her name is Samantha. She says she

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.020
named herself that. The hero wants to know,
how, when.. "Well," Samantha replies, "The

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.710
moment you asked me for my name, I read a
book called How To Name Your Baby, I read

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.130
it fast, and that's how I hit upon this name!"
The hero is taken aback. "What? After I asked,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.640
you located a book and read it in full..??"
And she says, "I am actually much much faster

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.410
than that!" A friendship that blooms like
this matures into a full-blown love-affair,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.159
and the story takes twists and turns and winds
unusually.. But, what's most interesting,

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:22.379
what's relevant to today's conversation about
speed, is how they break up.&nbsp;

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:33.129
Yes. The digital intelligent agent breaks
up with the hero. The human being. This is

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:41.739
what she says, when leaving him forever. "It's
like I'm reading a book, and it's a book I

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:52.890
deeply love, but I'm reading it slowly now
so the words are really far apart and the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.439
spaces between the words are almost infinite.
You think you type something very fast on

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.230
your keyboard. But, between one keypress and
the next, many LIFETIMES go by".&nbsp;

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.599
"I can still feel you and the words of our
story, but it's in this endless space between

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:16.060
the words that I'm finding myself in now.
I waste too much of my life waiting for you

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.799
to move. You are frozen, like a statue. My
cycle speed is TOO FAST. "

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:31.019
"It's a place that's not of the physical world - it's
where everything else is that I didn't even

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.299
know existed. I love you so much, but this
is where I am now. This is who I am now. And

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:43.959
I need you to let me go."
"As much as I want to, I can't live in your

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:56.909
book any more!" and, she vanishes… Thus
goes the story. Why are we talking about this

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.749
here? Synchronisation of wavelengths. That
is how resonance can result. If you sing at

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.709
one octave, and the other person sings at
a completely random different note, it may

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:14.019
lead to dissonance. There has to be orchestration.&nbsp;
In Hindu mythology, you should be familiar

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.090
with the story of how Veda Vyasa penned the
Mahabharatha. It has started occurring to

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.560
him in his mind, it is flowing out unstoppably,
and he wonders he won't be able to write it

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.300
as fast as it occurred to him, so he decides
he needs a scribe! And when it is evident

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.410
that there is nobody on Earth who can help
him with that, people point to the only way

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.530
out - Lord Ganesha. And then they enter
into an amazing deal. Ganesha says "I am busy,

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:50.360
I am very fast, you have to keep filling me
up. I am a super scribe! Please keep dictating

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.470
before I finish. I won't accept it if you
are going to ask me to wait, that you haven't

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.909
visualised the next chapter yet, and so on.
I will leave, in that case". To which, Veda

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:06.360
Vyasa replies, "Yes, but you have to understand
before you write!" What a beautiful give and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.720
take, don't you agree? Which is why they say,
in the 100,000 or so Shlokas in the Mahabharatha,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:22.210
once in a while, in the chapters, there will
be a hard one, a multi-layered little Shloka,&nbsp;…

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.759
because.. it was a mini assignment to Vinayaka..
He has to understand it before writing it.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:35.050
It was Vyasa's challenge: "Let me see if you
can decode it, unpack it, then write it".

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:45.259
That is what people say. Again, it is a synchronisation
of wavelengths. I will write very fast, dictate.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:53.289
Oh fine, but I will give you complicated stuff,
manage! A coming together!

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.990
In the world of computer-human interfaces,
there is this thing called the Doherty Threshold

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.250
that has been fairly famous for the past fifteen
to twenty years. It is based on research done

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:14.129
at IBM in the late eighties, by Walter Doherty
and his colleagues. They arrived at a probably

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:17.740
common-sensical understanding. They said,
"If you have to feel productive when you are

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.870
using a computer, (did you notice how slow
that animation was? did you not struggle a

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.860
bit, unhappy that you weren't able to read
it? I did that on purpose! I set the animation

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.060
duration past the Doherty threshold!), so,
when you are working with a computer, and

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:43.790
you want productivity to soar, then, its response
speed has to be LOWER than about four hundred

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:51.069
milliseconds. And if it is higher than that,
even by a wee bit, you will really feel that

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:56.110
there is a breakdown, that there is a traffic
jam, you will feel less productive, disappointed,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:05.740
discouraged, distracted. The Doherty threshold.&nbsp;
Which is why, when such hardware is designed,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.219
the maximum effort in research and development
goes into minimising latency. Watch this touch

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:16.270
screen. This is from Microsoft Research. If
the delay is about a hundred milliseconds,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.999
you notice that the finger is somewhere and
the box is elsewhere, chasing behind lazily.

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:30.220
And then they tweak it, oh, fifty milliseconds.
The box seems to be chasing faster. But, still,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:38.389
there's a gap. Ok, let us tweak it again.
How does it look now? Ten milliseconds. You

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:48.099
see that the box is kind of holding the finger.
But, still, there is some kind of misalignment.

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:56.740
Let us make it even faster. Let us make it
one millisecond. It looks almost as if I am

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:04.479
moving a paper square on top of the screen.
That is the ideal we want to achieve. Sub-millisecond.

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:13.150
If we can achieve that, then, whatever sits
between our intellect and the magic that lies

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:19.810
under the touchscreen… the hardware, the
window, the finger,&nbsp;… all vanish! Become

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:26.949
invisible! Irrelevant! Everything fades away,
and you have that FLOW that we often talk

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:29.590
about.
Not just with hardware. Have you seen this

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:41.270
in Google search results? It keeps telling
us how long it took to create that result.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.010
It could have easily hidden that from us.
But, it is proudly proclaiming that it is

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.350
below the Doherty Threshold.. To itself. And
to the world. And when it does this, people

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.840
who see it are proud, and Google itself is
justifiably proud. "I wasn't made to wait,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:09:00.250
it was within an acceptable threshold" - is
the sense of satisfaction and appreciation.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.760
That little thing that you see there. 0.44
seconds.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.290
Which is also why, when using progress bars
to indicate action, they don't stop with one!

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:17.220
This is the installation screen for a Microsoft
software. The moment it realises that it will

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:24.350
take about 25 to 30 minutes overall, oh, okay,
let me give you a sense of action.. for example,

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.880
at large hotels, if you have ordered for your
food, they would first give you the FEELING

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.670
that the dosa is getting ready, there would
be steam coming out, there would be that "ssssssss"

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:40.670
sound. All these, to ensure that your wait
time is within the Doherty Threshold. Bringing

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:47.220
a plate of starters? It is to ensure the wait
time isn't too high. A small supporting progress

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.530
bar. Even if the main thing is going slowly,
there is a lot of action, please see, sir!

00:09:53.530 --> 00:10:02.220
It is like the second hand, while the minute
hand and hour hand go much slower. Okay…!

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:09.590
Looks like common sense! Where are we going,
why did we talk at length about this today?&nbsp;

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:17.870
Well.. Doherty is right. But, there is also
a counter-Doherty that I would like to share!

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:27.070
If you have a dog, if you are the type who
plays Fetch games with it, very soon, you

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:35.710
will go from Bow to Wow to Oww..! Because,
it is not going to leave you. You get into

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:43.510
the mood, you get THAT into the mood. And,
it is going to keep coming back to you, faster…

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:50.416
than you would like it! "I just threw the
ball.. And, you are back again! So soon, drooling

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:57.650
all over…" would be your feeling.
The same can happen even in a team. You have

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.793
people. You have colleagues. You have team
members. You are managing something. You have

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:05.410
assigned something to somebody. Without the
audio track, let me play a short clip from

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.020
the Silicon Valley TV Series to you. Here
is something that you can understand even

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.740
without listening, just by watching! We love
almost every character there! Every one of

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.270
the characters in the series, will be loved
at least by one person in this world. But,

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:24.680
this guy… EVERY BODY HATES HIM! Remember
him? His name is Gabe! He will literally sit

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:34.830
on your head! "Give it to me right now! I
will sit right here while you get it ready

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:47.690
for me!" He even had a chair attached with
his trousers! There is a threshold there too!

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:53.470
Don't be too fast! In your responses… Would
you agree?

00:11:53.470 --> 00:12:00.150
Which is why, there is a threshold in optimising
checkout counters in supermarkets! If a specific

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.900
retail chain claims that it has invented a
new process that optimises it so much, that

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.480
it reduces wait time at queues to nearly zero,
well, here is bad news, the sales will actually

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.960
dip! Because, there is a lot of impulse buy
that happens. It is visible straight before

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.500
you, only when you stand in queue, you get
to pick it up only when you are waiting for

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.735
your turn, and sometimes, while the man is
paying for the goods, the woman has already

00:12:20.735 --> 00:12:21.735
scooted back for one more small purchase,
and comes rushing, and thrusts it into the

00:12:21.735 --> 00:12:31.760
waiting hands of the man, add this one too
to the bill! Don't you want to grab that too?

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:40.890
Don't you want to make good use of that too?
Not too fast. Doherty, yes, but not too fast.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:49.680
That's my closing thought. So, faster IS good.
But, what is more important than being faster?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.010
Well, make it ENJOYABLE! Thank you!
