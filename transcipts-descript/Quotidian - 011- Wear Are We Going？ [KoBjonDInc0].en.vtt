00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.419
Namaste!

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.040
Yesterday, I showed you a shoe!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:17.760
And I told you that I would be telling you
something about it later!

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.619
It has the letter N emblazoned on it, as you
can see.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.619
It stands for “New Balance”.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.740
Let us dig deeper about it, today.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.830
In the year 1820..

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.430
It is 2020 now.. 1920… 1820…!

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.680
This man was born in 1820.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.350
He is famous for one very important story.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.629
What was he wearing when he went to his friend’s
house to attend a party, and he was ejected

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.440
by the security guard there because he wasn’t
dressed for the occasion.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.789
They often say in Tamil, “Aal Paadhi, Aadai
Paadhi” — Half is the person, but the

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.859
other half is what they are wearing..!

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.340
And, this man quips, okay, you were wanting
to respect the dress, weren’t you?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.340
Here you go!

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.949
And he pours the coffee on to his dress, offers
the bread to his trousers, for all the food

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.939
is for the dress after all, yes?

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.380
— So goes the story.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.400
Wrong priorities..

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.049
That is what this famous educationist was
mocking at.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:26.750
If you take Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple,
this is how he dressed himself up in the 70s.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.540
Fully decked up!

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:37.079
But, if you track the evolution of the man
through the years, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2004,

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:46.470
2005, 2007, 8, 9, 2011 — he passed away
in 2011.. and on his last appearance on stage

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:57.070
just before he died, he was wearing the same
turtleneck jacket, faded jeans, and New Balance

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.070
shoes.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.929
So, what’s so special about this attire?

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.210
Well, he had visited Japan once.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.130
And, he had met a desginer by name “Isse
Miyake”.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.400
He is the designer who designed the uniform
for Sony Corporation.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.780
Steve pitched the idea to him — Design a
uniform for me too, I don’t want to wear

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.780
anything else!

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.220
After his death, when Walter Isaacson surveyed
his home, they found his wardrobe filled with

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:30.140
the SAME DRESS, enough to last him a lifetime,
even if Steve had lived much longer than he

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.140
did.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.200
In the movie “Jurassic Park”…

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.019
you see a scene from the Jurassic Park movie
on the left, and on the right, you see a scene

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.520
from The Lost world (Jurassic Park Part 2),
even though most of the actors have changed

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.519
between the movies, Ian Malcolm, the scientist,
the one who researches about Chaos Theory,

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.269
Jeff Goldblum is the actor, see how he is
wearing a black dress across both movies…

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.660
He has a continuity of sorts, across two movies
that came in a gap of three years…

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.760
94 and 97..

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.540
If you want to understand a little bit more
about this, you need to dive into the book!

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.420
Written by Michael Crichton.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.959
Ellie, the palaeontologist looking up at the
dinosaurs…

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.250
Ellie asks Ian a question.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.269
Is it not a little warm for black?

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:34.329
And, he responds: “No, as a matter of fact,
black is an excellent color for heat.

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.770
If you remember black-body radiation, black
is actually best in heat.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.829
Efficient radiation.”

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.610
He also says: “In any case, I wear only
two colours, black and gray.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.510
These colours are appropriate for any occasion.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.599
Whether I go for a condolence or for a party.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.599
No problem.

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.980
They go well together, should I mistakenly
put on a pair of gray socks with my black

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.980
trousers.”

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.769
But she asks: “But don’t you find it boring
to wear only two colors?”

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.200
To which he shoots back: “Not at all.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.579
I find it liberating.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:26.180
I believe my life has value, and I don’t
want to waste it thinking about clothing.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:38.400
I don’t want to think about what I will
wear in the morning.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.230
Truly, can you imagine anything more boring
than fashion?”

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:53.400
And, as a coup de grace, he spits out this:
“In the information society, nobody has

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.300
the time to think.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.700
We expected to banish paper…

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.810
But, we actually seem to have banished thought!”

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.390
It was a really revelatory moment when I read
this passage in the book.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.770
Don’t mistakenly think this book is about
dinosaurs.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.060
There are many philosophical gems hidden inside.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.980
This is why I really like the concept of the
uniform in children.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.470
Because, it even hides unnecessary bits of
info about their economic background.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.520
In fact, that is why I like it even more what
is happening today.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.600
The classes we conduct at Zoho Schools these
days, students appear in video calls.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600
Like this.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.310
You can’t tell really, how tall they are,
whether they even had a bath or not, how plump

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.950
or lean they are, what background, nothing!

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.590
We don’t care about anything!

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.260
We only look at your intellect.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.240
We focus on the message.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.090
So, the only thing you need to focus on, today,
is the message!

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.280
The message called “Focusing on the message”.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.730
What you shouldn’t focus on is this little
thing here, which is… what I am wearing

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.730
here.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.730
Alright.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.730
Thank you!

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.900
Namaste!
