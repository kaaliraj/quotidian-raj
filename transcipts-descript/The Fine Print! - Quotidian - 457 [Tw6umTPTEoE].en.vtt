00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.950
Hear this carefully..

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.649
Are you able to recognise this statement?

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.870
Mutual Fund investments are subject to market
risks.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.410
Read all scheme-related documents carefully.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.560
Vaguely reminiscent of having heard it somewhere..

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560
yes?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
But..

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.310
This is not how you hear it when you hear
it.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.000
THIS is how it runs.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.620
Mutualfundinvestmentsaresubjecttomarketrisks.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.240
Readallscheme-relateddocumentscarefully!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.860
Why?

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.950
This is the equivalent of an audio fine-print.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.810
Why do they do it like this?

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:59.430
We are going to explore the various dimensions
from which we can look at that Fine Print.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.080
Namaste!

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.780
The Fine Print!

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:17.370
Way back in 2007, there was a movie titled
The Ghost Rider.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.860
Johnny Blaze is a stunt rider.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.770
His dad is afflicted with cancer.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.930
He is upset, not knowing what to do.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.930
The Devil visits him.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.930
And, says this.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:47.680
“The thing about cancer is the time it takes…
the toll on loved ones.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:02:09.129
Johnny, what if I could help your dad?”

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:17.480
Johnny wants to know “How!”

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.250
And, he replies, “How is not important.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.250
What if I could make him better?

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.250
Give him back his health?

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.250
Would you be willing to make a deal?”

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.250
Johnny is ready.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.250
“Name your price”, he says.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
The Devil says, “Oh, I will take your…”…
looks around and adds, “soul”..

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.250
I will give you all the riches in the world.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.250
All the powers anybody would ever want.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.250
Give me your SOUL.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.720
That’s probably the sneakiest deal ever
made.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.200
It happens even in The Bible, if you remember
the stories.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.129
The Fine Print is all that matters.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:54.140
Once upon a time, cigarrette packaging used
to look like this.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.849
To understand what the dangers are, you need
to.. first of all have very good vision.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.720
And, you must turn it around at odd angles
to make out what is written.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.390
And, the message there would be, “The Surgeon
General is warning.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.390
Pregnant women MAY be affected.”

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.440
Do you know how it is today?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.790
This is how it is!

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.330
The Fine Print is no longer fine print.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.680
It is on your face.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.010
With gory photographs like this.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.930
People suffering.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.530
And textual messages like that.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.670
Something seems to have changed along the
way.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.580
This rock group was called Van Halen.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.120
Eddie Van Halen, an amazing guitarist, and
the band he created and conducted in the 70s

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.299
and 80s.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.209
This band, when it traveled, it used to make
some demands.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.819
If you want us to come to your city, and perform
a concert in your stadium there, these are

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.400
the things I need…

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.629
They would send a request ahead, up front..

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.180
But, before we get to that, let us first enjoy
this short video and understand what kind

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.489
of performers they were..!

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:45.830
Panama is the name of the song being performed.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:58.180
So, almost loony performers, extremely athletic,
they got the crowd moving, and they really

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.419
needed special apparatus.

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.699
But, no, it wasn’t just about the apparatus.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.590
Look at this list.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.780
This is what they sent ahead of time..

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.270
Only later did they find out why they were
sending this eclectic list.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:22.210
Because, the apparatus required was so complicated,
and even if one thing failed, the quality

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:30.009
of the performance, the, probably the HEALTH
of the performer, the injury, could happen..

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.880
And so, they needed to cross-check.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.259
But, to cross-check a million things, it wasn’t
easy.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.560
And, so you know what these people did?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:51.140
They sent a funny list like this, and they
used to go to the snack bar, and look for

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.100
the M&amp;M’s they had asked for.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.900
And, once they confirmed that the M&amp;M’s
were there, they would scrutinise the bowl

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.510
for BROWN M&amp;M’s.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.780
And, if they found even one.., “Oh my God,
these organisers aren’t really reading the

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.580
messages we are sending them..

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.669
They are not giving any attention to detail..

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.060
The Fine Print seems to have been lost.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.990
And, so, we may have to check everything once
again..!”

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.880
This was their red herring.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.880
This was their beacon.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:32.090
They used this to evaluate the performance
of the stage managers and organisers!

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.139
How interesting!

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.449
This lady, Donelan Andrews..

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.560
She won a ten thousand dollar lottery, and
guess how?!

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.830
She took out a travel insurance.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.940
She, and six others in her school group, decided
to travel to London.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:05.370
And, for that, they need to sign a document,
long agreements, etc, and you need to pay

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.190
money, and that is how you get your insurance.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:16.710
But, the insurance agency, on the seventh
page of the document, they had started a paragraph

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.590
saying, “It pays to read.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.840
Thank you for reaching till here.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.280
The first person who writes an email to us
after reading this paragraph, gets ten thousand

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.680
dollars.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.520
Thank you for reading..!”

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.110
That lady wrote, they honored the agreement,
and she won ten thousand dollars.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.330
And, who was she?

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.550
She was a schoolteacher.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.900
Even when at school, she used to give exam
instructions like these..

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.669
Who reads them though?

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:56.710
Do you read instructions ever?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.190
Nor do I!

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:08.849
But, as the fifth item in the list, she would
say, “Circle every prime number answer in

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:13.490
the answer paper, and get ten marks extra!”

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.970
Just a way to check (and encourage) that you
read the instructions carefully!

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.949
She had grown up giving tests like that!

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:24.900
Donelan Andrews!

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.030
Fine Print is important.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:33.849
That Fine Print is important, you don’t
need to go beyond this famous story, to prove

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:34.849
it.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:38.350
The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:44.120
Shylock, the heartless Jew, has lent money..

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.270
And, wants it back.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:55.780
And, knowing Antonio is not going to be able
to pay it, will show his document.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:01.140
“If I can’t pay on time, I will pay you
a pound of flesh” — the document read.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.709
And, he would ask for the pound of flesh..,
knife brandishing.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:13.089
That lady, Portia is her name, she is the
person who is dealing with that case, for

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:15.339
her lover.

00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:20.870
She looks at the document, appeals to the
judge, appeals to the Jew, nothing works,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.360
and then she realises there exists a loophole
and exclaims, “Hey, waittaminnit, .. You

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.620
are looking for the pound of flesh.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.130
Take it.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.040
But, not an ounce more.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.110
Not an ounce less.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.579
Exactly one pound.

00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:35.579
Take it.

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:38.520
And, oh, by the way, not a drop of blood.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.459
Because, that isn’t mentioned here.

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:48.980
So, in this legal world.., why do these legal
document sound so complicated, sound so convoluted?

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:57.230
Well, .. to prevent such sudden twists in
cases such as these!

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.899
Language is porous.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.390
Language is ambiguous.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:08.149
Human nature is to be cunning and to bend
it the way they want it.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:14.210
Without any other go, we are forced to have
language like this.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.200
But, when doing customer service…

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.610
Well, if it is legal, that is understandable.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:27.790
But, when you are doing it for a customer,
your aim should be to make users awesome.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.709
We have seen this lady earlier too.

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:38.000
In this book, Badass, she talks about a beautiful
dichotomy.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.240
Take a single product..

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.680
Like, the Camera.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:53.750
That camera is here to make life so much easier,
make fame so much reachable, for that photographer.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.750
Okay..

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.860
How do you sell it?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:03.459
What visuals do you use when marketing it?

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:11.709
Before I give you my money, this is how you
are advertising it to me.

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:13.430
An adventurous scene.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.490
An amazing camera angle.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.510
A HDR-quality background of blue sky.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.510
Eye-candy!

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.860
You make me drool!

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:28.269
But, what happens after I have given you the
money.

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:30.880
This is what happens.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.180
This is how every manual on earth looks..

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:41.520
If I have to achieve something, if I have
to understand, after I have given you the

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.180
money, this is how you treat me.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.270
WHY?!

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.470
She asks..

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.490
Think about this.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:12:00.310
Good marketing focuses on what the potential
user REALLY wants to do.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.370
What do they want to do?

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.720
AFTER they buy?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.130
You should be focusing on that, shouldn’t
you?

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:16.290
She concludes by saying:- “They don’t
want to be badass at using our thing.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.399
Probably our camera.

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:18.510
Probably our tool.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.620
Probably our software.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.709
They don’t want to become expert at using
that.

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:31.060
They want to be badass at what they do with
it.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.980
They want badass results.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:45.180
If you focus on that deeply, you can avoid
cheating using fine print and hiding behind

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.720
legal mumbo-jumbo”.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.980
That is what this company did.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.459
A 28-page legal document.

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:58.810
That terms-and-agreement document was converted
into an image, a flow-chart, something even

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.110
kids would be able to understand.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:11.480
Yes, there was a “Word from our Lawyer”
at the bottom, but this gave them a refreshingly

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.839
new perspective..

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:13.839
“Wow!

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:16.519
A company that is so helpful to their users?!

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:19.199
A service that is so friendly?

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:22.399
I would like to do business with that company!”

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:28.610
In 2010, Obama signed a Law.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.510
An Act.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.579
Plain Writing Act of 2010.

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:36.060
What I love about it?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.870
The intent of the Act itself was an example
of plain writing.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.140
Just three intents.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:52.690
First, they want to help customers, visitors
to the website, citizens of the country, find

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.300
what they need.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.209
Having found it, they have to be able to understand
what they found.

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:06.889
And, finally, use what they found to meet
their needs.

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:08.240
How simple!

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.589
How profound!

00:14:09.589 --> 00:14:10.940
How powerful!

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.290
How beautiful!

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:18.370
Assume a hotel, and a waiter at your service.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.399
I am locating it at two spaces.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.130
One, in the middle of nowhere.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.820
A long highway.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:32.490
Where you have been driving for hours, you
want to take a rest, and you hop off.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:38.550
Thirty minutes, one time interaction, you
have never been there before, you probably

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.019
will never be there again.

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:46.130
Compare the attitude of that server.. with…

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.329
A hotel in the center of a densely populated
city..

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:52.790
Close to your home.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.220
Your regular haunt.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.370
A Saravana Bhavan.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.690
Or a Vasantha Vihar.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.190
Imagine a hotel waiter in that location.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.750
I will ask you two questions.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.579
Tell me if the mentality of that waiter would
be the same, or if it would be different.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.450
Question number One.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:26.529
If you were ordering a salad, would he just
chop the cucumber and tomato and offer it

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:31.020
to you on a plate, or.. would he apply a special
garnish, a swan-bird decoration and an additional

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.020
flourish?

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:37.990
How would he do it in the highway case, and
in the city-center case?

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.579
Question Number Two.

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:46.449
Assume you leave, and you forget to take your
smartphone or your wallet.

00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:53.649
Will you be able to get it back HERE, or HERE?

00:15:53.649 --> 00:15:55.699
What am I underlining?

00:15:55.699 --> 00:16:02.930
I am underlining the difference between a
one-time transaction between a stranger and

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:09.760
a lifelong growing value of a customer who
is with you forever.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:17.040
In the city-center case, the waiter takes
the effort to add that flourish.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.570
Because, there is competition.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:27.680
You are going to try out the neighbouring
joint if he doesn’t do a good enough job!

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.180
But, that’s not the story with the highway
location.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.180
No competition.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.180
In the city-center, you will come back.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.579
Stealing your wallet or smartphone, on that
single day, I will gain very little.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:41.430
Compared to the lifelong relationship I am
going to have with you.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.339
That is not the case with the highway location.

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:47.100
In fact, I can ask you Question Number Three.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.089
Where will you tip more, to the waiter?

00:16:51.089 --> 00:16:52.440
At the highway joint?

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.440
When are you even going to set eyes upon him
again?

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440
Or, at the city-center?

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.519
You may return as early as tomorrow itself!

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.080
Get the point?

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.579
Fine Print!

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:06.640
Do not hide behind it any more!

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:16.780
Understand that we are in a crowded marketplace
and differentiate by being clear, lucid, friendly.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.600
As a closing thought, I want to take you to
this website!

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.360
At Dilbert’s website, they have a Mission
Statement Generator!

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.189
You can choose randomly highfalutin adverbs,
verbs, adjectives, and nouns.

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:35.460
And, it will keep spewing out blah-blah-blah
statements through the pointy-haired-boss!

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:46.429
It tells you how cheap and vulgar and how
simple and boring the concept of a mission

00:17:46.429 --> 00:17:48.669
statement is.

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:51.240
Do not hide behind legalese.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.230
Do not hide behind Fine Print.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.520
Come out into the open.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:09.780
Show us that you are ready and waiting 
to serve your customer.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.130
Thank you!
