00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.780
This is one of the greatest, most popular
computer games EVER. Mario… Or Super Mario…

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.950
Am sure you've heard the name. An interesting
thing happens in the Super Mario Game, as

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.520
you finish each level. A set of levels…
called a World. After a lot of effort, after

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.720
much sweat and toil, you will finally meet
a big boss… and you will have to fight that

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:54.710
big boss… and after that fight, see what
happens!&nbsp;……. You have to save the princess…

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.239
You are here to save the princess! But, there
is a toad waiting for you, that tells you

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:14.740
this.. "But our princess is in another castle!"
Sorry! Not Found!!

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:36.730
Namasthe! It is the 404th episode today. I
asked my friends, a question like this. "The

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.830
upcoming Quotidian video on 6th July… I
am planning to record it, upload it, and then,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.759
immediately delete the YouTube video link.
Guess why?" There weren't many responses,

00:01:50.759 --> 00:02:01.259
for a while. But then, one guy, one smart
guy, came up with the right answer. "Ahaa!

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:12.349
I've got it! 404! Video not found!" Yes, I
was trying to crack a joke on this "File missing.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.959
Page not found. Resource not found". For,
it is a famous HTTP error… On the internet,

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.910
while you are browsing, you request for a
random page, and if that page is no longer

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.180
available, that's what happens, that's what
comes on screen.&nbsp;

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.849
This is the famous Netflix website.. where
they have cracked a joke - a movie titled

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.660
"Lost in Space" - they have used a scene
from that movie in the background, and they

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.870
are asking us "Lost your way?"
This is the Marvel Comics website. Directly

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.370
from the Marvel Cinematic Universe… "Hey…
Hydra has stolen this page from the S.H.I.E.L.D

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.560
database!" A little joke again!
Here is another. This is the Amazon 404 page.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.550
Guess what they have done? They have demonstrated
that Amazon is not all robots, there are real

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.860
humans there, real humans who have pets, and
their pet-photographs, the cats, the dogs,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.760
along with their pet names,&nbsp;… In addition
to just saying Sorry, they are also giving

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.300
a personal human touch to the 404 page.
Here is another example - some company,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.739
"Emailcenter" - they ask us "Who do you
want us to fire? You tell us yourself!" A

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:43.300
developer, a designer, a marketer… almost
playfully lined up like for a shooting squad.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:51.800
You can actually pick one of them. The other
three will gloat and boast.&nbsp;

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.220
All these playful things apart, is there a
certain philosophy..? Should we look deeper

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.020
into this concept of a 404 error? We go looking
for something. We have reached our original

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.990
destination now. What we searched for is nowhere
to be found. Remember? We saw this in Super

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.759
Mario. The Princess is not here. She is in
another castle. Is there a deeper layer to

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:28.240
this? That's what we are going to see now.
It started in CERN. The European Research

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.599
Agency where the concept of the Internet was
morphing into the much more popular World

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:42.050
Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners Lee, he was laying
the foundations of the Web. This is the corridor.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:55.030
Along the left edge of that corridor, a plaque
stands in memory of those times. "Where the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.729
WEB was born"! There is a room in this corridor.
The fourth room in the fourth floor of this

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.009
building. That is where they had the central
database - which file is where - and

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:12.300
it seems, the people working in that server
room, when a resource was requested, and that

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.899
file was not available in that database, they
used to stick a paper poster in front of that

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:25.069
room, saying "404! (That room number!) File
Not Found!" At least, that is how the story

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:34.219
goes! But, it has been pooh-poohed as an urban
myth. Many scientists, one of them, very famous,

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.430
Robert Caillou, a person who worked closely
with Sir Tim Berners Lee himself, he has gone

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.410
on record and said, "There is no 404 room
in the 4th floor. What are you talking about?!"

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:53.199
But… do you see a joke right there? Hidden
in plain sight? 404 cannot be found! Do you

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.740
get it?! Of course it won't be there! Do you
get it?!

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:08.279
We have talked about this in earlier episodes
too. In Quotidian 043, we talked about people

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:15.699
going in search of something and then realising
that it is the journey that is important and

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:24.719
not the destination. We heard about a book
called The Alchemist. And then, Ulysses, after

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:30.569
the Trojan War, after the big win there, is
returning to his hometown victorious. Ithaka.

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:36.619
A poem about his attempt to return home. A
beautiful poem written by Constantine Cavafy.

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:45.069
That poem - titled Ithaka - picturises
very beautifully that your journey is more

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:51.509
important than that little goal. Ithaka will
always be there. We are going to see a few

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:59.979
snapshots from that poem, now.
It starts with this scene. Ulyssess is setting

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:09.740
course for Ithaka, and immediately the poet
warns him "As you set out for Ithaka…"&nbsp;

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:17.320
"Hope the voyage is a long one…! Full of
adventure, full of discovery..! Pray that

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:26.229
you get interesting experiences along the
way!" That is the blessing he gives Ulysses!

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:34.199
He travels for twenty years! Very short distance
from Troy to Ithaka. But, he travels for twenty

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:40.360
years. He is buffeted here and there. But,
each is a learning experience.&nbsp;

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:48.809
"Keep Ithaka always in mind. You needn't forget
that. You shouldn't forget that. That is where

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:54.110
your wife and son are waiting. Arriving there
is what you are destined for. That is your

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.679
destiny. That is what you have started out
to achieve, so happily and eagerly. No problem.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:12.479
But… Do not hurry the journey at all!"&nbsp;
"Take your time, meet people, collect experiences,

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:20.969
learn stuff, so that, you are old by the time
you reach the island. Rich with experiences…

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:23.819
Having met so many people, having learned
so many things…"

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:30.029
"Finally, Ithaka gave you the marvellous journey..
If you are ever going to wonder what Ithaka

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:40.759
really helped you with, it gave you that journey..
Without her, you may not have set out on that

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:53.319
journey! So, even before you reached Ithaka,
she has given what she intended to give you!

00:08:53.319 --> 00:09:00.950
She has nothing left to give you now!" Thus,
beautifully, ends that poem.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:11.279
&nbsp;I have been on this trip. The Sabarimala
Pilgrimage. A 46-kilometre trek. With an "Irumudi"

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:17.839
package balanced on your head. With the unending
chant of "Swamiye Charanam" on your lips,

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:26.079
through terrain like this… through a jungle
really. Through a jungle on a hill. On a series

00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:36.730
of hills. Seven hills. You pass through Sarangutthi,
Kallidumkundru, the Pamba river, the Azhudha

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:46.579
river, Kaalakatti, Neelimala, Karimala….
In fact, there is a particular place, a two-kilometre

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:53.920
stretch - I have been there thrice - you
will actually realise why the place is called

00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:01.800
Azhudha! Because… by the time you finish
that trek, you would be crying! So hard is

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:10.629
that barefoot journey. At the end of a pious
penance.. a 45-day abstinence… A special

00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:17.970
journey. At the end of it, past all the commotion
and milling crowds, this is where you reach,

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:24.240
this is the Sannidhaanam.. Just after this
crowd, are those Eighteen Steps, where they

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.920
will pull you up, and next in front of you
will be Saastha, Dharmasaastha, Aiyappan.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:39.250
But, after all these hardships, after all
these trials and tribulations, when you reach

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:46.899
that top point, you know what greets you?
You know what is waiting there for you? This

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:55.110
is the message!
Tat Tvam Asi. In Sanskrit, it means, "Thou

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:04.220
Art That". "That is You". In the Hindu Scriptures,
there are Four Mahavakyas.. Four sentences

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:15.660
of great essence. Of those four, this is one.
This is the first, in fact. Tat Tvam Asi.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:22.800
That thing you have been searching for all
along? You have been that! It is you! What

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.740
you needed to discover, what you needed to
find out about, was you! That is the beautiful

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:36.910
message there. So, yes, you go in search of
something, and you don't find it,&nbsp;… being

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:44.870
heartbroken about it defeats the whole purpose.
You are missing the whole lesson there. The

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:51.959
lesson is the experiences you have along the
way, the people you meet, the lessons you

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:58.149
learn.&nbsp;
I have just one closing thought here, by Benjamin

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:03.350
Mays. A man from the previous century. A man
who sowed the very seeds for the American

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:13.470
Civil Rights movement. He had a beautiful
quote. It seems he said, "The tragedy of life

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:22.850
doesn't lie in not reaching your goal." Where
does it lie then? "The tragedy lies in having

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:30.300
no goal to reach!" So, don't mope in a corner
crying that you received a 404 error! Think

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:39.220
"What was the journey I had to reach that
404 goal? Was THAT worth it? And, what's my

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:52.360
next goal?" Thank you! We shall meet next
week!
