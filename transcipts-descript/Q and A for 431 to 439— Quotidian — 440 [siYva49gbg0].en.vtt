00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.290
“Vanakkam Raj san.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.580
My name is Annamalai.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.050
I have been watching your Quotidian videos
from Day 001!

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.100
I have and always will be a huge fan of your
Quotidian series.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:37.210
It has inspired me in so many ways, from motivating
me to read more books, helping me work on

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.160
my side-projects, and most importantly, helping
me learn something interesting every day!

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.170
Looking forward to a never-ending Quotidian
series!

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.170
Nandri!

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.170
Vanakkam!”

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.970
That is Annamalai.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:01.071
One of the many ardent fans and probably learners,
I would say, of the Quotidian Journey, and

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:07.700
I am truly proud and happy to have him here
and be the host for Four Hundred and Forty.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.619
Four Hundred and Thirty Nine have gone by.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.530
We are going to try and answer the questions
and comments that came up out of episodes

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.420
431 to 439.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.300
Raj:- That description…

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:29.880
In Youtube, the description of the Quotidian
videos, chapterme.co — He is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.330
the founder of that company!

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.680
Why don’t we start by hearing you speak
about that?!”

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.049
Annamalai:- Namaste to everybody.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.020
And, thank you Raj, Rajendran, Raj san as
I would call, for inviting me.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.830
And, I think, I’ve been watching from Day
001, and the thing I like best about this

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.000
whole thing is, he gives me a lot of insights,
different things, and relates it to business.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.540
And, I run a startup, and so, I learn a lot,
from different books that I have not read,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.860
and also from, lot of these life lessons,
that help me in my journey.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.399
So, thank you, Raj san, for inviting me.

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.239
And, to talk about ChapterMe, the idea came
to me when I realised that I was watching

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:16.740
TOO MANY YouTube videos, and I found it difficult
to watch the whole video, almost like an ADHD

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.220
perhaps, I am not actually, but I have that
issue, I don’t have too much concentration

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.660
to watch long videos and podcasts.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.100
So, my idea was “Why not have chapters,
like we have in books!”

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.269
And, this was how this initiative started.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.590
Raj:- Nobody else has it…?

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.590
Wow!

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.819
Annamalai:- Nobody else has done it as of
today, but people are starting to “get”

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.819
it.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.120
But, earlier, when we started, no one was
doing it.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.870
Nobody really understood what this was, when
we went to the market.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.930
But, now, slowly, people are starting to understand.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.849
How this helps with SEO.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.129
And, also for the viewers as well.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.450
Once upon a time, viewers would just skip
and run away, but now they understand more

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:07.420
about the content, they watch more, the viewing
duration has gone up, that has really helped.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.250
We have been doing this for nearly a year
now.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.590
We are about like thirty customers, both companies
as well as YouTube creators.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.590
So..

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.380
Annamalai:- So, let us go from 431 to 439.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.250
Let us look at some questions.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.220
And, I also have a few questions to ask, along
the way.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:41.540
In 431, Sumitra Palanisamy had posted a comment
about Pamper Versus Pander.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.340
Please pamper, but don’t pander.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.290
Even for me, it was a really interesting thought…

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.269
Raj:- They call these “base desires”..

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.580
I distinctly remember a scene from childhood.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.700
Something that has been burnt into my memory.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.900
About our nextdoor neighbour.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.390
They were watching TV, all the family members,
together.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.000
The Child is crying out loud.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.909
The Mother is trying to control the child.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.069
The Father is busy watching, and doesn’t
want to be disturbed.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.579
And, he is imploring the Mother to control
the Child.

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.579
“Attend to him”, he says.

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.569
The Mother tries, but fails, and explains,
“There is a large ant on the floor, and

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.610
he wants to crush it!”

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:27.389
and the Father….. (believe it or not!) says,
“Why don’t you catch the ant and give

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.949
it to him then!?”

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.080
It happened!

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.860
In my childhood, I distinctly remember this.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.180
I think this is pandering.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.440
For, there seems to be no value system at
all.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.130
We can’t let a child have its way, if that’s
going to fracture the value system!

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:55.160
If we do that, we are not preparing him or
her for a meaningful life beyond this parental

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160
cocoon..

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.889
A school, college, work environment, society,
we are not preparing that person.

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.169
We can’t blame them, afterwards.

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.449
So, pamper, but don’t pander.

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.270
Annamalai:- Very well said.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.190
Another resonant thought that comes to mind
is your words on “Tough love”.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.020
That’s like really important.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.759
You need to provide the love, but it needs
to be with constraints.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.820
Raj:- I am giving you attention, because I
love you.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.960
And, that attention is probably leading you
to receive some harshness from me but remember

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.110
that also comes from a position of love.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.419
“I won’t waste my time and energy advising
a random kid on the street, it is only to

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.100
you that I will offer them!”, my Dad used
to tell me!

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.310
Annamalai:- Yes, you’ve talked about this
before.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.430
You had also talked about another concept
— “Watch and Learn”.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.199
Where developers can learn by observing.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:06:01.240
You had talked about the Onam festival, where,
after cooking you go and watch and find out

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.270
from the eater’s expression… and, I was
reminded of a company called Drift.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.470
It is an embeddable-chatbot company.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.699
I heard that they had mandated that every
employee in the company joining the workforce

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:14.990
would work in the customer support channel
briefly…

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.620
Raj:- Has to go through that experience…

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.620
Annamalai:- Exactly.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.539
When you do that, you learn, you understand
the customer’s perspective.

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.810
You become a better developer.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.729
Raj:- Right.

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:26.729
Beautiful.

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.150
Feet on street can’t be separated from the
people here doing the other work.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.080
One can never run a successful business that
way.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.039
What are the daily trials and tribulations
of these people here, those people there must

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.039
always know!

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.380
Annamalai:- Next, we come to 432.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.380
Burnout.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.479
Lots of beautiful points.

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.030
Lots of interesting comments too.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.990
One of these was from Sethuraj.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:58.360
At 18:03, you talk about the candle being
burnt on both ends.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.460
He says, “I love that.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.590
I learned that you can’t do two works simultaneously.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.729
Pick one, finish, then start the next.

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:06.729
Planning is important.

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:18.130
Balance is important between the emotional
and rational sides.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.000
There are infinite possibilities, after all.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.110
Lots of paths available”…

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.000
Raj:- Do one thing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Do it well.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.870
This is something that our great-grandparents
have been advising us about, since time immemorial!

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.680
My grandma didn’t like it when I was reading
a book while I was eating.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.740
Because, she felt it was an insult to the
culinary effort that had gone into preparing

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.740
that food.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.750
I have put in a lot of effort.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.940
I didn’t read a book while cooking this.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.930
You don’t read a book at least while eating
this.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.330
And, .. that Flow.. the book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,
he says specifically, again and again, just

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.330
this one point.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.280
It takes time to get your wavering mind to
focus on one thing.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
It takes time.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.629
If you are going to let it swing between TWO
things, it is like trying to ride on two horses

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:15.690
at the same time.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.800
It is impossible.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.900
Isn’t it?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.789
Annamalai:- Also, it is like, one of the most
important causes for Burnout.

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:27.139
Like you doing multiple things.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:32.159
And, moonlighting is such a prime example
of that.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.350
Raj:- Correct.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:40.340
Annamalai:- Sumitra Palanisamy talks about
two rules to beat stress / depression.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.909
Change / Alter the things you are in control
of.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.930
Go with the flow for the ones you can’t
control anyway.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.920
Like they quip in the Vikram movie, “Paatthukkalaam!”

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920
Raj:- “Paatthukkalaam…”!

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920
Yes.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.810
But, the problem here is, the elders speak
words of wisdom and move on with their lives.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:03.110
The common man, you and me, the problem we
face is, we are not able to immediately ascertain

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.760
what’s actually in our control and what’s
actually not!

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:15.360
We think we can influence a customer, we think
we can launch a feature and get millions of

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.120
new registrations, but we don’t realise
that it is not in our control, until the last

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.120
minute.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.120
And…

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.290
yes, it is right to say “Don’t obsess
and fret about things that are not in your

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.700
control”, but I think a lot of effort should
be put in to find out what’s in your control

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.080
first.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.510
Probably NOTHING IS!

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.390
Probably nothing is in our control.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.819
Let us start with that precept.

00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:48.450
The only thing in your control is the ability
to do meaningful work true to your conscience

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.450
and passion.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.510
Why don’t we start the game assuming we
have nothing ELSE in our control?!

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.820
Probably that’ll lead you to more happiness.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.450
Annamalai:- Less control is like more…

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.650
Less is more!

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.640
Raj:- Yes, Less is more!

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:08.700
Annamalai:- I had another thought of mine.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.470
Like, what can be done in person…

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:23.080
You had talked about stuff that has to be
done appropriately, where.. for example, some

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.510
things have to happen over a call and not
an email…

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.940
Raj:- Yes, while talking about remote work?

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.140
Annamalai:- Yes, you need to understand the
situation.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.089
Some, you can do in person, some you can do
over a call, some can be texted.

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:44.240
And, so, according to the situation, adapt
yourself, and not like just focus on one way…

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.100
Raj:- What is your personal experience?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.100
Working…

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.230
do you work in the same office, or, remote
offices, from home…

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:54.260
Annamalai:- Earlier, we were working from
remote locations, but now, we thought, this

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.110
was a crucial expansion phase, why not work
together, because it gives a much better experience.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.670
Raj:- So, you think coming back to office
makes sense?

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.660
Annamalai:- Yes, coming to the office is important.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.260
When you are a small team, particularly, it
makes a lot of sense.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.980
When you are together, you tend to achieve
more.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.579
Raj:- But these software folks, folks like
you and me, … their usual refrain is, “All

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:16.149
I need is my computer and an internet connection..

00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:20.250
Why do you force me to come to office”…
and what is your reaction to that?!

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.090
As a young CEO?!

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:27.140
Annamalai:- Well, this is how I see it.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.140
It depends.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.140
For some, this clicks.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.140
This works.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.389
They can do things on their own.

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:33.959
They are more productive doing it that way.

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:36.459
And, you can perhaps let them do it their
way.

00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:37.649
Perhaps, they are introverted.

00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:42.570
Raj:- The senior lone-wolf people, who have
understood how the company works, ok…

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:47.910
Well, this is something we both are on the
same page on, then!

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:53.709
Annamalai:- For some others, it may be better
for them to come to the office and work…

00:11:53.709 --> 00:11:54.709
Raj:- New joinees, …

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:57.940
Annamalai:- Yes, new joinees, for they need
to learn the culture, and understand the vision

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.019
of the company so they can do their work right.

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:02.110
Raj:- Thumbs up!

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.959
Annamalai:- One more comment was from Shankaran
K..

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:08.170
He asks, “What made you choose this topic”.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.610
Because, you choose different topics, some
of them are very relevant…

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.250
Raj:- Well, it just struck well for you.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.410
I am looking out at the dark sky, and throwing
a random stone.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.329
And, you are on the other side, to catch this
particular stone, while expecting something

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:26.529
to come your way!

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:28.600
That’s the way I see it!

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.589
A happy coincidence that you like it!

00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:40.100
How do I choose the next topic, frankly, 440
episodes have gone by, and I don’t choose

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.960
one too far ahead of the time.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.630
When I was doing 365 topics in 365 days, I
would start thinking about the next video

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.610
after finishing the current video.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.240
But, now, you know that famous “Last day
tension”?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:00.001
When that hits you, I ask myself, what did
I read interesting in the last few days, what

00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:06.920
did I interact with my students at Zoho Schools
in the last few days, is there a book I read,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.940
I attend a book club meeting every week, did
somebody talk about something interesting,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:17.231
stuff like that, collected from here and there,
small nuggets, half-polished gems, if I can

00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:21.940
put them together, string them into a necklace,
… that is my aim.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:28.170
Till now, touch wood, it has been running
well, I don’t have a plan!

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.120
Seriously, I don’t have a plan!

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.510
Annamalai:- He also mentions that this is
a much-needed awareness video for working

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.010
professionals, for they need to understand…

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.350
Raj:- Burnout, yes?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.350
Burnout!

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.350
Yes!

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.320
Actually, you know what, that was the trigger!

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.870
There was a talk about burnout, at the level
of Zoho Schools.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:56.279
One of the STUDENTS, a seventeen-year-old-kid,
hyper-active, super-performer, we never expected

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:59.130
that person to say this to us..

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:06.130
That person came to us and said, “I am feeling
kinda ….”, … and that’s when I decided

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:12.139
to research a little more into it, and the
person is much better now, they also watched

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:15.079
the video, and that was the trigger!

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:21.259
Annamalai:- The other thing is, Zoho Schools
allows, Zoho as a company allows, people to

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:22.259
be open.

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:24.459
Some companies don’t.

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:26.160
Raj:- I would agree.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160
Yes.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.950
The hierarchy is much flatter.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:37.000
A flat hierarchy and an open culture prevent
the majority of the scenarios that lead to

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.770
seclusion and depression.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:47.019
Annamalai:- You had also mentioned about automating
tasks and delegating, to reduce burnout.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.320
I was thinking the same thing.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:57.279
Some of the tasks that are not very important,
you can automate, or delegate it to others

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:59.899
who are more capable.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.940
I saw this first in the Four Hour Workweek..

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.940
Raj:- Tim Ferriss…

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.500
Annamalai:- Yes, he had talked about it.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.510
He says, this can help get you out of burnout.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.000
Make your life better.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.149
Raj:- Because, … the robots are coming!

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:20.329
They will do a better job than you if the
job you are doing is repetitive, is programmable,

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:23.930
is automatable, they are coming, they have
taken it already.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:29.420
There was a person in our company, by name
Santhosh.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.089
His nickname was Scriptananda.

00:15:31.089 --> 00:15:32.089
Guess why?

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:39.580
More than half of the work he would do would
be about how to avoid doing work!

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.290
He would write a script for everything.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.120
The only script he didn’t write.. is a script
to write scripts.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.890
That’s how we would joke about him.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.920
Scriptananda!

00:15:49.920 --> 00:16:00.690
So, I think our aim should be to try and obsolete
the routine robotic part of us..

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.579
We should shed that and strive to climb upwards..

00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:06.139
Or else, it is going to be hard.

00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.139
Very hard!

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.139
Seriously!

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:09.700
Annamalai:- The next is about 434.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.740
Memory Hook.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.860
Vineet and Shankaran had made similar comments.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:21.190
They had commented about your intro music,
that they got addicted to it!

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.199
Raj:- Oh, the music in the beginning…

00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:25.199
Ha ha…

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:26.199
Annamalai:- Yes..

00:16:26.199 --> 00:16:28.610
It was like a memory-trigger for people listening.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:39.899
And, .. Shankaran was also talking about whether
you were active in coding and development…

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:43.370
Raj:- I think he was asking whether I was
active…

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.500
Well, deeply interested to be still in touch..!

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:55.139
For a very very long time, I have nursed projects,
half baked, half done, open on the IDE for

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:59.100
ages, .. someday, I plan to resume those.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.790
In a week, there is a new year coming in.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:09.300
Perhaps, somehow, I will wriggle a daily activity
involving coding into that too..

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.570
Let us meet on Github soon!

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:19.799
Annamalai:- Yes, I think, it is very important,
as a leader, to kinda show, that you are also

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:22.839
doing it, so that the others can follow.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.390
It is a good thing!

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:36.929
In Quotidian 435, in Mind Your Brain, you
had talked about becoming a parent, the whole-brain

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:37.929
child…

00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:47.560
Mohanavelu Ramasamy was becoming a parent,
and he was asking for parenting tips, and

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.299
any insights.. and what you have as a parent..

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:54.610
Raj:- So, .. well, some people have asked
me.. friends..

00:17:54.610 --> 00:18:01.289
people who became parents AFTER me.. they
have committed the mistake of asking me parenting

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:05.190
tips and advice… and I have only said this.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:11.300
“Do not try to control what you have no
idea what it will grow into”.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:18.030
There is a chess game on the one side, and
a gardener’s role on the other side.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:25.250
In the chess game, until the player decides
to move a piece, it is inert, it has no idea

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:30.840
what role it is playing in the game, and then,
after it has moved, it becomes inert again,

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.130
and waits for the next moment where the chess
player will probably touch it.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.919
That’s the life of the chess game.

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:39.900
That’s what we think parenting is.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.900
Sorry!

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.900
No!

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.850
The child has a life of its own!

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:49.950
Every moment you are wasting time with others,
the child is living a life, learning lessons,

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.640
good or bad, so be… the gardener mode.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.340
What is the gardener mode?

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.120
It is your responsibility to give it fertiliser.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120
Do it.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.510
Good light is your responsibility.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.679
Do it.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:04.600
Good irrigation is your responsibility.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.760
Do it.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.870
It is your responsibility to remove the intervening
weeds too.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.039
So, do it.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.490
After that?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.490
Wait!

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.490
Hope!

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.490
Wish!

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.490
Want!

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.490
Watch!

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.490
It will blossom.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.100
Probably a beautiful flower, probably a sweet
fruit, it will come out beautifully, all by

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.100
itself.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.560
That would be my message.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.010
Are you a dad yet?!

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.010
Annamalai:- Err..

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.010
Not yet!

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.549
But, will be soon!

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:40.030
The other followup question I had was, you
have spoken in multiple occasions about how

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.049
you homeschooled your child.

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:46.909
So, I think one question I had was, how did
you handle multiple things together, for that

00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:47.909
itself is a task..

00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:50.150
so, how were you able to handle it?

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.559
Raj:- I have to be thankful to Zoho for it.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:57.179
My wife and myself, both work in the same
company.

00:19:57.179 --> 00:20:03.299
In fact, my son has joined me as a colleague
in the same company, and, we weren’t too

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:06.090
particular about time, in-time and out-time..

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:13.970
So, we ensured that she would enter the office
much later, and I would rush in a lot earlier,

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:19.059
and I would take a break in the afternoon,
to come over, spend some time with my son,

00:20:19.059 --> 00:20:23.660
and I would work late at office, while she
would come home earlier, and … so on.. we

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.170
were able to pull off a skewed work timetable.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.040
And, we ensured we always moved wherever the
company was.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.039
It was like a stone’s throw.

00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:34.289
Literally a stone’s throw, from office.

00:20:34.289 --> 00:20:37.750
We wasted no time in travel.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.390
And these things were really beneficial and
we were able to juggle..

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.410
Also, when anybody mentions homeschooling,
immediately, the focus is on NIOS..

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.900
(National Institute of Open Schooling).

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.900
Not really!

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.440
I had decided early in the game not to go
for any such alternative SYSTEM either.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.940
I had the flexibility, hence.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.710
I created my own one-man system, for him.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.510
My wife, thankfully, she agreed, and played
along.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.480
And my son, really cooperated!

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.480
And the result is, for the world to see soon!

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480
Yeah!

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.730
Annamalai:- Definitely, you should do one
episode on Homeschooling.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.990
There will be many interested in your approach.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.680
Raj:- Yeah, I guess.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.070
Annamalai:- We move to Quotidians 436 and
437.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.150
Despicable You!

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.150
Smartjeev…

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.630
Raj:- Know what?

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.490
Nobody appreciated it..

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:28.710
In 436 and 437, I had chosen a specific color
to show the two numbers..

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.760
I was hoping somebody would make the connect.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.760
Nobody did!

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.760
:-(

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:43.260
Annamalai:- There was a thirukkural that was
quoted.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.920
Centuries old thinking along similar lines!

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.760
Sellidatthukkaappaan sinangkaappaan, allidatthukkaakkin
en kavaakkaalen!

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.250
Raj:- I checked this one out, only after hearing
about it here.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.250
Beautiful!

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.660
Kural Number 301, I guess.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:12.250
The basic takeaway from that Kural is, “If
you control your anger even when you know

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:18.880
for sure that you can achieve stuff by showing
your anger, .. only then you are an accomplished

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880
man!

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.430
Not if you don’t show anger only after realising
anger won’t work in this scenario!

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.860
It doesn’t really matter then, whether you
show your anger or suppress it!”

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.460
Yes, I think I had talked about it in a closing
thought…

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:42.120
On whom, for what, and how, and to what extent,
you are going to show your anger… that is

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.059
what is going to set you apart as a learned
individual!

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:50.419
Annamalai:- And, you had talked about the
“Certified Kazhudhai Kuzhi”..

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:53.740
It was very nice to see you avoid the asshole-word
completely!

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:59.429
Raj:- I didn’t want to use that word, and
so, we went ahead and said, “Kazhudhaikkuzhi,

00:22:59.429 --> 00:23:00.429
Kazhudhaikkuzhi”…

00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:04.870
Annamalai:- That was very nice!

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.220
One final question.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:15.049
About Alexa the Great.

00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:20.150
Shine and Glow had tried “Self-Destruct”
and found it amazing!

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.200
It was so interesting to hear about the many
skills that Alexa has.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.490
Raj:- The thing that is best about it?

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.620
That it can be trained!

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:41.120
Compared to the other services like Siri or
Cortana, .. Alexa has made it very easy to

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.470
get itself trained..

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.440
If you have developer access, you can teach
it skills!

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.090
That is the growth mindset Carol Dweck talks
about in her book.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.900
That is easily inbuilt…

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.320
It appears in the Matrix movie too…

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.230
Do you know how to fly that chopper?

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.250
The answer from the lady is not “I don’t
know”.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.080
It is “Not yet!”

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.320
Not yet!

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:19.010
Annamalai:- You had also posted an image of
the burning library of Alexandria.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.040
Raj:- Midjourney!

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040
Yes!

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040
Annamalai:- I tried it too.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.260
It was like mindblowing!

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.830
Like, you just give it a description and it
creates a mindblowing image version of it!

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:35.850
And, like you said, Your job is at risk, and
here is a prime example, right here!

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.500
Raj:- I am surely going to do an episode on
these guys..

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.760
This ChatGPT, Midjourney, WallE,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.460
Annamalai:- All OpenAI.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.789
They are doing like wonders, right!

00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:49.130
Raj:- So, do you have any AI in your own products?

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.130
Annamalai:- Yes!

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.890
AI is involved.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:25:04.070
We look at the video, the transcript, break
in audio, we look at all of that, to find

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.070
out segments.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:10.539
But, these look even more advanced.

00:25:10.539 --> 00:25:14.350
Raj:- Alright then!

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.390
Thanks a lot for being with us, and thanks
a lot for being with US!

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.010
All the best for your initiatives!

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.909
And, thanks for Chapterme.co!
