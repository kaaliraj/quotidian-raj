Vanakkam.

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:09.742
When dealing with customers, when interacting
with prospects, when providing support to

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:14.040
those that you serve, keep this important
thing in mind always, said my boss, a few years ago.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.140
That’s what I intend to share with you all
today. If you look at these boxes here, ISTJ, ISFP,
ENTP, ENFJ, … there are sixteen such boxes!

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.920
Two scientists, researchers, named Myers and
Briggs, did a psychological profile of thousands

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.360
of people from various walks of life… way
back in the 1950s.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.440
They tried to find out if there were a finite
number of personality types — and they concluded

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.660
that there were sixteen such.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.930
They called it the Myers Briggs Type Indicator.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:05.530
Millions must have taken the test since then
(it is even available online for free!), and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.560
over time, it has lost its sheen too, and
a few even question it for its veracity.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:20.920
But, what’s important is that you know that
there is a concept such as that, and we are

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.509
just going to focus on only ONE of those sixteen
— titled the INFJ.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.859
INFJ stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling,
Judging.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.899
A person with the influences of these four
“qualities” is titled an INFJ.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.119
If you were to be dropped into a specific
situation or scenario, your reactions would

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.829
stem out of these four starting points.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:56.229
You are 
a Feeling-person.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.100
You use the Heart more than you use the Brain.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.039
You don’t just Perceive.

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.039
You want to pass a Verdict, pass a Judgement
all the time.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:19.629
So, this makes you highly sensitive, you don’t
open up much, you end up getting the label

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:28.950
“You are taking things too personally”
all the time.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.200
The customer might bark at you for some reason…

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.400
The product isn’t performing well, there
is a bug in this functionality, something

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.569
is broken here, etc..

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.280
And you “take it personally” and feel
as if it is you yourself that is broken!

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280
You go home.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
You cry.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.620
The next day, the dark heaviness is still
weighing down on you.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.069
So, this is what my boss said.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.099
As an antidote to the INFJ.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.959
He said, “Develop a thick skin”.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.069
In fact, this advice isn’t suited just for
customer service…

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.860
It could be about the people in your home,
the teacher you are taught by, the colleagues

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.090
you work with…

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.280
Stakeholders — of every ilk.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.130
Whatever you produce, there will always be
people who are in a position to criticize,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.480
talk about, pass verdicts on what it looks
like and how it feels.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.480
Consumers.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480
Customers.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480
Colleagues.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.480
Partners.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.480
Competitors.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480
Critics.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480
To deal with these people successfully, … my
boss said..

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.120
“Develop a thick skin”.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:44.150
If you develop a thick skin, like the one
on the proverbial “Delhi buffalo”, whatever

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.519
torrential rain beats down, it will still
stay immobile in eternal bliss, eyes half-closed,

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.749
in the middle of the road…

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.569
Develop a thick skin, he said.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.280
I first thought it was the buffalo he was
referring to.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.580
But, later, I googled around and looked for
the animal with a thick skin.. thickest skin..

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.380
the animal with the thickest skin…

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.230
The whale, with all its blubber, is of course
the winner..

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.230
But that is underwater.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:19.780
But, among land animals, the thickest skin
belongs to the elephant.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.840
The word “pachyderm”, referring to an
elephant, stems from Greek terms “pachy”

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.460
(meaning “thick”) and “derm” (meaning
“skin”)!

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.400
It is pretty thick too.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.850
3.8 centimetres at some places!

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.990
But my research didn’t stop there.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.360
There was something beautiful hidden just
out of sight.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.500
That’s when I realised that there is a lot
more to it than meets the eye, whenever my

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.030
boss tells me something!

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.850
Much to discover, if only I dug a little deeper.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.290
Why thick skin?

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.740
Why elephant skin?

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:03.020
Even if it is 3.8 centimetres thick…, even
if it is thick enough to withstand the assault

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:15.640
of a spear head on, even if it is impervious
to arrows shot at it, (it is the elephant

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.240
force that goes up front… for it can tackle
all kinds of weapons thrown at it)… have

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.900
you seen how an elephant, first thing after
a fresh bath at the riverside, throws trunkfuls

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.910
of dirt back on top of its body?

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.910
Guess why?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:38.350
A mosquito can actually suck blood through
this 3.8 centimetre skin!

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.350
How?

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.960
Because there are a lot of gaps in between.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:53.210
That is why, even though its skin is so thick,
the elephant is supersensitive, it can even

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.250
sense a mosquito sitting near its ear.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:06.760
So, that then, is the speciality.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.900
Don’t just develop a thick skin!

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.860
Also be sensitive for those micromessages!

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.120
That’s the important lesson for today!

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.100
Thank you!
