00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.040
So, in Mathematics, you would have approached
a lot of problems algebraically. When you

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.090
enter higher classes, the teachers would have
said, “There is a geometric solution to

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:22.199
this, which is a lot more elegant!” Multiple
pathways, leading to the same answer… Don’t

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.749
we have it in religion too? We think that
there is but One God.. One Religion. But,

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:35.190
when we encounter other religions, and the
beauties that exist in them, that is where

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:52.060
we realise the Hows can be many! This is what
we are going to talk a bit more about. They

00:00:52.060 --> 00:01:03.760
call it “Elegant Solutions”. Beautiful.
Beautiful in its Simplicity. Unexpected Simplicity,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:14.590
and Elegance. That’s what we are going to
see! Let’s look at a couple of examples!

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.530
Namaste! Elegantly Simple! Should be beautiful.
Should be simple. Should be elegant. There

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.289
are many examples, in nature, in the work
of mankind, smart, clever, things. We are

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.630
going to review a few.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.860
Pythagoras Theorem — I am sure every one
of you remember this one! Two sides. They

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.970
could be of any length. But, A Squared added
to B Squared will always be equal to C Squared.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.479
Said Pythagoras, 2500 years ago! Till date,
there have been more than 350 different kinds

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.280
of proofs for this popular theorem. Among
these unique and different approaches, there

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.039
is one that I think is most elegant. This
one comes from Mr. Pythagoras himself! Extremely

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.119
simple. Just using four pictures. No higher-level
maths! Look at this unfold!

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.999
So, A Squared added to B Squared.. Is it always
equal to C Squared? For arbitrary values for

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:09.090
A and B? That’s what we are going to see.
Take any random triangle, with random side

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:19.150
lengths a, b, and c. (Oh, wait. Not any random
c. But a particular c, that makes it a right

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.489
triangle). Repeat it and make a set of four
exactly look-alike triangles. Now, move those

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:37.980
four around to rearrange and form a square
like this. As you set this up, you will notice

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.239
an inner-tilted-square forming, with side
length c. So, the area of the inner-square

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.530
would be c squared. Everything is clear till
now!

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.530
Now, remember the colors of these triangles..
Use the same triangles. But, let us take them

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:10.641
on a further excursion. And, reconstitute
them in the form of TWO RECTANGLES. I am not

00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:19.959
changing anything else! If you notice carefully,
we now have two rectangles with side lengths

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.520
a and b.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:34.629
Okay! Now comes the clincher! As you can see
on the left, the empty space inside the four

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:42.150
triangles is c squared. And on the right,
the empty space has now become two spaces

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.750
and its areas are respectively b squared and
a squared (as the empty spaces are squares

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.340
of side lengths a and b respectively!)

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.650
From this, we realise that irrespective of
whatever a or b values you begin with, c squared

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.879
will always be equal to a squared plus b squared.
Proved! Q E D! Whatever was to be proved,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:18.430
has been proved! Pythagoras himself has given
this proof.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.460
In Nature too, we can see such elegance presenting
itself often! So, assume there are four cities

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.240
arranged in a square form like this. And,
the Municipality wants to connect these places

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.000
up for travel. Or, so goes the story. And,
they invite suggestions.. on how to lay the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.220
roads. People come up with suggestions. One
of them comes up with … a criss-cross pattern.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.500
(Length 4 + 2√2)

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.979
But, .. the authorities complain that there
are multiple paths between the same cities,

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:00.940
and they are trying to minimise road-length
so as to keep costs low. Another proposes

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.790
a grand circle. From wherever to wherever,
a circular path. Outer Ring Road! (Length

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.790
π√2).

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.529
But the authorities feel it can be shortened
further.

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:16.759
A straight line approach? (Length 4).

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.220
Or even a shorter-straight-line approach (Length
3).

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:32.000
This is good, but to go from A to B, is a
circuitous hell through D and C… Is there

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.090
a better way?

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.490
Another person came up with an X. (Length
2√2)

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:54.450
Is there a better way? Yes.. Another person
came up with an I pattern. But, the road length

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.470
is still 3..

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:05.129
Is there a superminimum? There is a field
of mathematics called Calculus of Variations.

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:12.160
A complex mathematical concept — and after
deep analysis, one can prove that THIS IS

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.720
the minimal distance possible. You may not
believe the final answer when I show it to

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:30.780
you.. You may not even be convinced that this
is the shortest! But, take a look! This is

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.700
the minimal distance structure. The angles
at the center are exactly 120 degrees. There

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:46.180
are two convergence points. And these convergence
points are called Steiner points. But, how

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:54.220
do we even arrive at something like this??
We need a mathematician for this. For each

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.290
city. For each highway department! Perhaps,
only then! Or, .. do you have soap in your

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:08.870
bathroom? See what this guy does! He is a
mathematician. Look how he demonstrates the

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.400
answer for that roadways problem.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:24.370
How?! How did soap know? Did it hurriedly
get a Ph.D in Higher Maths just before dissolving

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:53.270
in the water? How does Nature know, to minimise
it? When we need a maths Ph.D to derive those!?

00:07:53.270 --> 00:08:16.880
But, at least these, you can say it is soap,
man-made solutions, etc, but here is an even

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.069
more interesting demonstration of elegance
for you!

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:41.039
Here, we have a river flowing — top of screen
to bottom of screen. And, near the river,

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:51.930
there are two little towns. One a little farther
from the river, and the other a little closer.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:09:01.890
They want to set up a water distribution station
somewhere in the bank of the river, so that

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:07.720
these straight pipelines can serve water to
these two towns, while keeping pipe-laying

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:15.480
cost to a minimum. They think about it! Should
they do it like.. This…

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.980
Or, should they do it like That…

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:26.110
Where should they keep the station so that
the pipe-length total is a minimum.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.519
Or, should they try this configuration…

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:40.730
You know what the answer is? The elegant,
simple answer? Start by imagining a mirror-image

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.100
of the closer-town on to the other side of
the river. Lay a straight-pipe-line imaginarily

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:54.500
from one town to the other, passing through
the river. Look for the point where this imaginary

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.899
pipeline crosses the river! THAT is your optimum
point for locating the water distribution

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:11.649
station. Start laying the pipeline from that
point towards both towns! Hey! Light beam?

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:22.000
Angle of incidence? Angle of reflection? Hey!
How does light know to minimise pipe length?!

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.779
Isn’t that simply amazing?!

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:36.710
VanMoof is a Dutch cycling company. VanMoof
exported its cycles to America too. Their

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:46.430
cycles were world-class, after all! But, the
problem was, it started getting delivered

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:55.610
with breakages. They tried larger boxes, better
packaging, they even wondered if they should

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:05.360
switch delivery agencies… They tried literally
everything under the sun! But, nothing seemed

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:17.820
to work. Great cycles, but when delivered
from Europe to the Americas, the customers

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:23.560
were unhappy and the company didn’t know
what to do. They brainstormed for ideas..

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.690
And, one of them quipped, “If only this
were a smart-TV, do you know how carefully

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:35.250
they would be handled?!” They pounced on
that single thought, and said in unison, “That

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:44.089
is what we are going to do!” From that day
onwards, VanMoof cycles started being delivered

00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:55.550
in a box like this! It features a very large
television inside which there is a cycle!

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:05.839
So, the delivery agents looked at the “Fragile
/ Careful” notice, saw the image of the

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:10.459
TV, and immediately, subconsciously, became
a lot more caring and attentive.. They started

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:18.430
delivering the cycle with as much respect
as they used to deliver a Smart TV. VanMoof

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:25.990
even included the word “Smart” on the
packaging! Ride the Future! Smart! Electrified!

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:37.460
How clever! Zero extra cost almost. For nothing
changed in the design or the composition of

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.460
the box!

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.810
And, finally, we can’t be talking about
elegant, simple, out of the box, without referring

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:51.510
to Steve Jobs! This was the first iPod. It
wouldn’t even have fit into a pocket! And,

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:58.070
very heavy too! When Steve Jobs was shown
this first prototype, he was livid! “No

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.579
way, make it smaller!” was his response.
The engineers responded with, “Sorry, we

00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:08.350
can’t go back to the drawing board. It is
nearly impossible. Everything has to be redesigned.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:17.290
I don’t think it can be made any smaller”..
While the engineers were walking with him

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:37.810
in the corridor, Steve Jobs paused, turned
back, went near an aquarium, and dropped the

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.230
prototype into the water! Plop!

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:45.910
It settled in the bottom, and a moment later,
there was a gurgling bubble rising to the

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:54.240
top. “That’s it”, Steve said, “there’s
space there. If bubbles are coming out, there

00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:03.570
must be empty space inside. So, make it smaller!”
And, only because of this relentless pressure

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:09.380
that Steve applied on his team, advice, tension,
emergency, panic, pressure, … a couple of

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:19.600
months later, Steve was able to do this. Ten
thousand songs in your pocket! He was able

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.220
to launch that magical device!

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.160
As a closing thought, we have been discussing
elegant simplicity. We have read before — Simplicity

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:41.200
is the Ultimate Sophistication. Albert Einstein
himself (or at least some people say he did!)

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.149
has said once:- “When the solution is simple,
God is answering!” God herself is talking.

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:55.139
It is not you. Not me. Man can’t do it by
himself. There is something divine involved.

00:14:55.139 --> 00:15:04.190
Something far beyond human comprehension.
What humility! Alright, we will meet next

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:14.750
week! Thank you!
