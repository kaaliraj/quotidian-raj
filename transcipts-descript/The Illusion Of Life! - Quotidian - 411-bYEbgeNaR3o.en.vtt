00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:10.119
Nearly a hundred years ago, “Steamboat Willie”
is the name of this animation sequence. Walt

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:17.790
Disney launched the first such animation.
Not just plain animation, but the audio perfectly

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:25.640
synchronised with the action on the screen.
And changed the world. The thing we now call

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:51.100
Movie Magic? That’s what he introduced.
Steamboat Willie! Mickey Mouse was introduced.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.989
But, guess what the prevalent assumption is?
That Walt Disney drew the Mickey Mouse character,

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.190
created it.. We have seen photos such as this
one, haven’t we? But, it seems he was only

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.900
posing for that picture! He didn’t draw
it! A close associate and long time friend

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.150
of Walt Disney, by name Ub Iwerks, somebody
who has worked for many years at Disney, he

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.670
is the person who actually created it. Walt
Disney gave the voice though. That falsetto

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:39.430
high-pitched tone of Mickey Mouse’s voice?
Disney is the reason! Interesting, eh?!

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:57.340
Namaste! The Illusion of Life! That is the
topic for today! Some people say I have this

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:06.860
bad habit! Of connecting these common day-to-day
quotidian affairs and trying to see some serious

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.530
philosophical lesson there, logic there, some
connection there… Many have warned me to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:24.630
let the thing lie undisturbed! You may remember
perhaps. Quotidian 309 — I tried drawing

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.069
some connections between living one’s life
and celebrating Diwali. They may even be tenuous

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.060
connections… I tried doing that. And then,
in Quotidian 341, my son took me on a ride

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.920
in the car, and immediately I started comparing
the Journey of Life with the journey one does

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.880
on a highway, and I tried doing a Quotidian
on it. Do take a look at them and tell me

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.280
how you feel. If you like those two, you may
like this one too.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.200
Because, we are going to talk about this book.
This book is called The Illusion of Life.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.069
The master animators who have spent decades
perfecting the art inside the art factory

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.920
of Walt Disney.. they have put together an
amazing.. a visual treasurehouse.. beautifully

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:26.570
illustrated, lucidly explained… The whole
world of animation, explained in twelve simple

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.000
principles. “Here are these twelve principles.
You follow them!” he said, gifting it to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.630
humanity. But, what is so beautiful about
it? Every clip, every movie, every bit of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.620
animation that had been done till then, followed
those twelve principles. And, guess what?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.180
Every bit of animation that has come AFTER
that book was published, continue to follow

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.780
those twelve principles. Almost like the Ten
Commandments. Twelve Principles. We are going

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.590
to look at some of those principles from that
book. And, we are going to try and connect

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.240
those up with life to see if there can be
any thoughtful reflections that we can gain.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:19.250
One of those principles is called “Squash
and Stretch”. Crushing and Stretching. As

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:31.080
it gets faster, it gets stretched.. As it
decelerates, even if it is a human being.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.000
Crouches.. Squash.. And then elongate. Stretch.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:50.340
Here is another visualisation. Squash and
Stretch. When falling, it extends… the emphasis

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:58.590
is on speed, momentum, weight, mass. If you
look at the whole sequence without the stretch-effect,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.150
it looks hard, unnatural.. With Stretch and
Squash in place, there is a life that is attached

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:24.889
to it. Realism. Even human beings. When picturising
them.. If they are going to jump, the way

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:31.780
they crouch. Squash. Even faces. Without Squash,
it looks dull and boring. With a Squash, there

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.110
is realism.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:42.770
After teaching all this, the creators give
us one little warning. The warning is the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:50.570
thing that rang a bell in my head. The warning,
goes like this. They say, Squash, Stretch,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:58.360
Animate, is all fine. But, remember! The volume
of the object should be retained. When a square

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.780
squashes into a rectangle, the other dimension
must be proportionately affected too. If you

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.259
are going to elongate along one axis, you
NEED to contract along the other. Only when

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:12.540
I saw this, did I realise that there is a
life lesson hidden there. We try to become

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:22.170
a Generalist. We try to become a Specialist.
The mistake is, we wonder if we could become

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:28.430
both. Sorry, dear friend, that’s impossible.
If you are going to spread yourself wide,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:36.030
and know, learn, a lot of things, by all means
do. But, realise you can’t go deep. If you

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.960
want to go really deep into something, understand
everything there is to learn about it under

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:51.190
the sun, if that is your intent, pick a narrow
subject, go deep. Because, you cannot stretch

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.380
in two dimensions. You Squash in one, you
HAVE to Stretch in the other, and if you want

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:03.060
to Stretch in one, you HAVE to Squash in the
other. What do you think?!

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:10.330
Here is another principle from that book.
This principle is called Anticipation. Expectation.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:19.100
If a ball is going to bounce from here to
there, it won’t traverse a simple straight

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:29.160
path. Watch! It goes back a bit.. There is
an anticipation. If a person jumps, he first

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:37.500
crouches and then jumps up. A golfer does
the same with his “backward swing”. Why

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:45.350
is this important? Well, Disney says, viewers
need to be TOLD what to look for on the screen.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:52.000
The screen is too big! 30-inch TV sets have
given way to 78-inch TVs. Where do you look?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.970
There is too much happening all the time!
And so, attract the attention of the audience

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:06.120
by showing where the action is going to happen
next. That is the core rationale behind Anticipation

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:16.319
in animation. Introduce Anticipation. Here
is another example. Anticipation. There is

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:24.440
a wait-and-release. Pull back and release.
Is he jumping? Well, there is a go down and

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:31.520
then release. If he jumps without crouching,
without coiling himself into a spring so to

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:39.870
speak, it will be lifeless and unreal. Not
realistic. While running. While punching.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.610
When you pull back and punch, you are able
to believe that the guy will cartwheel. But,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:55.060
when that is not there, he just falls flat.
Running. When you pull back, you CAN be Usain

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:00.870
Bolt. Showing shock. Shocking expressions.
There is a pullback… Some expression is

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:07.230
about to be shown. Now, show that expression.
This is good advice for animators. Good advice

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:13.720
to capture the attention of viewers. But I
thought, hey, Thiruvalluvar has said the same

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:21.640
too. Do you remember that Kural? The ram pulls
back its legs in preparation for the powerful

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:32.180
headbutt with its enemy. So that it can fight,
it can ram, stronger, harder. Do you remember

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:40.120
this one? Life lesson, I thought.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:46.279
One more principle from that book, is called
Staging. The authors remind us that we are

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:53.300
not drawing our characters in a featureless
void. There is a camera, there are some lights,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:59.220
there is a background, there is a foreground,
there is an action happening, you have to

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:06.420
look at all these before deciding how to position
your characters, the book says. See how beautifully

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:13.790
this artist has depicted in this scene. A
guy, proposing to a girl, and the girl showing

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:25.339
her happy shock and surprise! Nice! But, look
at that. He is offering a flower. How perfect

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:34.670
the pose is! Strong posing, look at the attitude,
the mood, the idea, it is drawn so well in

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:41.560
fact, that if you remove all the inside details
and look at them as just silhouettes, even

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:52.310
then you get the idea of the shocked girl
and the supplicating young man. This is the

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.930
perfect drawing.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.880
Compare it with this drawing. In this, it
is the same guy, the same girl, the same intent,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.370
but see how the intent is conveyed… Because
the guy is facing the camera, it is missing

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.400
from the silhouette version. Is that a flower
in his hand? Or a knife? Or perhaps a gun?!

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:19.560
What is he having in his hand? This is BAD
drawing, while that is good staging, say the

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.420
authors. What lesson can we take away from
this? Well, the one thing that occurred to

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:32.890
me the instant I set eyes upon it, was this.
Staging.. Yourself! Who are you? Can you consistently

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.110
display it and demonstrate it, irrespective
of the performing stage? Whether you are on

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:43.779
stage, or off stage, from whatever angle and
point of view they look at you from, will

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:52.250
they be able to glean what kind of person
you are? If A R Rahman is going to say he

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.180
can perform only when is on the stage, with
his favourite piano at his side, he can’t

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:05.130
be a world-famous musician. On the other hand,
whatever he has around him, he will consistently

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:10.230
create amazing world-class tunes, and that
is why he is truly famous, that is the consistency,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:19.660
that is good staging. Point of view matters.
Ensure, even if those defining details are

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:29.490
knocked off, when I look at you as a silhouette,
will you still speak of who you are and what

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:38.019
you stand for? Then, you are the Maryadha
Purush.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:43.670
One more principle from that book. This is
called Exaggeration. To overdo things! Specifically,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:51.820
Walt Disney used to go ask his artists to
exaggerate the features of the animated content!

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:59.390
Here, take a look at this series of animations.
A person turning to look. Reflecting the way

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:07.120
it happens in real life… Slowly, there is
an Exaggeration introduced. The eyebrows go

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:15.000
up. The gape widens. The eyebrows peel off
the forehead. The eyes are now bulging out.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.580
And now, finally, they pop all the way out!
Do you see that? The cartoonisation? The caricaturisation?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:28.210
Disney says this is important because, the
world is filled with bored, tired, lazy people.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:36.120
If we are to quickly and surely grab the attention
of these people, you need to indulge in that

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:43.220
little bit of Exaggeration. Go beyond realism.
Do you remember this movie? This is from the

00:13:43.220 --> 00:14:01.760
movie The Mask. The eyes are popping out,
the heart does a dance outside the shirt,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:11.300
… you must remember this guy! Everything
he did was Exaggerated. Why did they attempt

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:22.071
this? People are bored. People are tired.
People are habituated to realism. If you are

00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:26.139
going to show something JUST AS IT HAPPENED,
well, I am not interested. I can see that

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:33.870
all around me. You are not attracting me enough.
But.. If I Exaggerate, if I show you something

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:41.260
that you can’t really ever see in the Real
World, then, you are interested! Probably

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.950
that’s the situation in real life too. The
world is FILLED with average people. If you

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:54.320
are going to be happy being average, without
exerting an Exaggerated effort, without demonstrating

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.600
an Exaggerated result, if you are going to
be fine with it, well, I don’t think you

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:06.840
are going to be noticed, I don’t think you
will be counted. So, if you are aspiring for

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:17.630
that spotlight, for that fame, do something
extra. Go beyond the brief. Run the extra

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.380
mile! Lesson?!

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:31.149
Meanwhile, along with these twelve principles,
there are some rules of Physics that get broken

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:35.779
too! In this world of cartoons, some rules
are turned upside down, nonchalantly disobeyed

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:41.620
too! I want to talk about two rules and what
we learn from those.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:50.329
Here is Rule Number One. We call it the Free
Fall Fallacy. What is that? I am sure you

00:15:50.329 --> 00:16:12.050
remember Wile E Coyote and the Road Runner.
It is all foggy out there in the desert. Road

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:20.579
Runner has arrived too.. And that’s when
he realises, there is nothing underneath.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:37.660
Are we standing in thin air?? That’s when
gravity takes over. This is so common that

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:43.029
one doesn’t even get a laugh these days,
looking at this charade. But… there is a

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:52.790
lesson there. When you are in pursuit of your
goal, with single-minded obsession, with an

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:58.530
unwavering focus, if you are proceeding forward,
won’t they say the usual, “The Universe

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:09.149
will PAVE the way”? Rules will bend. Rules
will break. For you! But the moment that small

00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:14.970
crack, that fissure, that seed of doubt gets
sown.. What am I doing? Can I even do this?

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:26.939
Is this even possible? That is enough. Gravity
will come knock at the door. Newton will take

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:34.720
over. Till then, you can pursue your goal.
So, singleminded obsessive focus is so important.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.720
Is such a blessing!

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:47.100
Another law of physics. Let us watch it being
broken! Again, Wile E Coyote! And the Road

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.779
Runner! This is called the Perforation Paradox.
A vehicle is coming right ahead. Towards the

00:17:52.779 --> 00:18:04.820
coyote. Did you notice the hole made on the
rear wall of the vehicle? And on this floor?

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:17.009
And on this screen? Exactly matching the body
that went through. While I watched this, I

00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:21.039
had an epiphany. An important lesson. I almost
felt like hitting myself on the head. This

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:26.779
is the mistake I had been doing all along..
The mistake, the fundamental core mistake

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:32.150
in the act of giving advice. Guess why these
bits of advice fall flat, are useless, usually

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:37.690
irrelevant, and never really taken seriously?
Why is not received well? Why is it so hard

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:44.869
to implement? Well, look at it.. What do we
give our advice based on? It is based on OUR

00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:54.090
past. Our prior experience. And, our prior
experience is like this hole. It is different

00:18:54.090 --> 00:19:01.960
for every single one of us. So, based on just
my prior experience, if I am going to say,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.879
THIS approach will work out, THIS approach
will lead you to success, THIS approach will

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:15.249
lead you to failure only, it is going to work
only if YOUR silhouette is the same as mine,

00:19:15.249 --> 00:19:24.460
do you get it? I can go through this hole.
Can you? You can’t. Because your hole is

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:33.639
different. Your silhouette is different. That
is the reason most advice is probably useless,

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:43.910
unpalatable, irrelevant, impractical. What
do you think? The world of cartooning. Giving

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:51.250
us something to take away. In the world of
philosophy, good living, and motivation.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:58.940
Anyway, closing thought. I want to tell you
about Bertolt Brecht. A philosopher. A German

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:10.739
philosopher. He has given a beautiful quote,
one that connects Art and Life. He says, “Art

00:20:10.739 --> 00:20:19.720
is not a mirror to reflect reality,”…
It could be cinema, it could be music, it

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:29.379
could be paintings, that is not art. To reflect
the way things are today.. Our heritage. Our

00:20:29.379 --> 00:20:38.450
culture. Art has a greater duty. A higher
honor. Guess what? “Art is the hammer that
