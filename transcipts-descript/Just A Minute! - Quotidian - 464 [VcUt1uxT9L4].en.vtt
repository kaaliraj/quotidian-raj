00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.470
They call this an Internet Minute.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.299
One minute..

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.460
What happens in that one minute, in the Internet.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.100
This company called DOMO, has been launching
an infographic..

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.640
“Data Never Sleeps” they call it.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:27.090
If you look at the 2023 version of it, 1.7
million posts on Facebook, 66000 images on

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.680
Instagram, 350,000 posts on Twitter, and it
continues…

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.630
6 million searches on Google, and in Tinder!

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.510
1 million swipes on Tinder!

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.829
And it continues like that..

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.969
So much happens in a single minute..

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.890
Even if you are just a consumer, you have
too much to consume..

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.960
It is almost like drinking from a firehose!

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.730
YouTube?

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.850
The location you are watching this video itself?

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.880
500 hours of new video every minute!

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
Compare it with 2013, ten years ago..

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.570
At that time, 48 hours of content was being
created every minute.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.750
Ten times as much!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:50.180
So, I forgive you if you are not going to
watch this video till the end!

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.439
In this episode, Four Hundred and Sixty Four,
we are going to see the magnificence of the

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.439
Minute.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.799
In just one minute.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.430
What happens..

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.440
What can happen..

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.989
That is what we are going to see..

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:11.989
This self-help Tamasha…

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.800
The category of books, videos, lectures, workshops,
courses, .. the ones that encourage you to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.670
“help yourself”.. there has always been
a two-mind kind of dilemma about it.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.080
If you go to a bookshop, you will see books
like these.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.239
“Power of YES” on one side..

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.360
“Power of NO” on the other side.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.670
“Secret is to WORK MORE” will be sitting
pretty close to “Secret is to WORK LESS”..

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.739
“Less is More”, they will claim.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.440
Are they doing it on purpose?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440
This talking in paradoxes?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440
You will be left wondering.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.480
I have always been of the opinion that this
is self-contradictory.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.350
What is Self-Help after all?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.170
It is all about a person doing it by themselves,
yes?

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.820
In that case, if you go looking for help,
this is how the bookshelf should be!

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.110
There should be a small note there, saying,
“You have come to the right place..

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.030
Start working on it!

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.030
Do it yourself!”

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.870
Do you agree?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.640
They used to tell this story, about a boiler.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.610
A complicated boiler.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.820
The Owner tries to repair it..

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.030
He is not able to fix it.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.441
After many days of hard work, he throws up
his hands, calls the Expert.

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:43.349
The Expert is a pretty old guy, he comes,
keeps his walking stick on the side, and then,

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.120
just taps it in one strategic location, and
the boiler starts running.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.250
The Owner is all praise.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.500
All thankful.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.730
And then, the old man sends the bill.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.280
Twenty-two thousand dollars, is the bill.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280
“WHAAAT?”

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.430
the Owner complains, “All you did was just
tap on the side!”

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.380
To which the Expert calmly explains, “Hey,
I have charged just one dollar for the Tap.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.660
But, knowing where to tap?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.960
How hard to tap?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960
And when?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.539
That has taken me decades of careful learning,
stumbling, struggling, … That is what I

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.310
have charged 21,999 dollars for!”

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:52.639
So, yes, to learn some good lessons in life,
you need to go the long way.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:05:01.479
But, there are people who have gone the long
way, done a lot of research, and given you

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:11.120
that kernel, that small gem, the distilled
drop, the crystallised version..

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.139
You can accept that too, without too much
effort… is the lesson we learn from this

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.139
book.

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.419
It is called 59 seconds.

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.280
It is authored by a wise man, a Richard Wiseman.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.009
In the foreword to the book, he introduces
a lady, Sofia..

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:39.310
Unfortunately, I couldn’t get her picture,
so I took an AI-generated model, who doesn’t

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.310
really exist!

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:48.530
But, Sofia and this author are having lunch,
and she asks a question, “Hey, what do you

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.970
think about these books that say ‘Improve
your happiness quotient’, ‘Improve your

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.690
creativity’, these self-help books, what
do you think about these?”

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:09.220
And, Richard responds, “I am in that business
myself, but, tell me, how much time do you

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.160
have, to spend on these things?”

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:21.460
And Sofia responds, only half-laughingly,
(which is probably the time we all have too!),

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.440
“About a minute?”

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:32.850
And, that’s when it dawns on the author,
“Yes, one minute, .. that’s all we have..

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:41.330
What can we convey to our customers, to our
readers, to the people looking for solutions,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.319
in one minute?

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.990
What can we distil and crystallise..”

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.509
That is what this book is all about.

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.699
It is basically structured in a pretty formatted
manner.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.300
There would be a central theme.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:06.370
He would explode a commonly-believed myth,
first up.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:13.520
He would quote amazing research, data, that
dispels that myth.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:25.129
And, he will bring a beautiful tip, something
you can try today, in your own life.

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:31.300
That’s the format we are going to see, for
the next four chapters.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.300
Interviewing.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.190
You apply for a job.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.810
You make a presentation.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.970
How to ace that interview?

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.699
How to ensure you get through?

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.889
What’s the myth, though?

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:54.129
It is NOT ABOUT YOUR SKILLS.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:58.009
They are not going to take the final decision
simply based on your capability and skillset.

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:00.090
Again, this is backed by research.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.630
He gives a lot of data.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.930
Recent research.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.320
Go check it out.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.759
What’s important instead?

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.759
Likeability.

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:14.370
They should like you when they look at you
and interact with you.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.210
How do you ensure you are likeable?

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.129
Don’t say bad things about the company you
are coming from.

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:21.160
Be presentable.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:28.860
Even if it sounds like old-fashioned advice,
that smile is so important, he says.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:37.729
Especially the Duchenne version of it.. the
smile that reaches your eyes.. is so important.

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:46.130
He also talks about a particular research,
where, when you speak ill of somebody else,

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:55.330
those listening to you will not only learn
that this somebody-else is such, but will

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:01.060
also INFER that this person who is currently
speaking is a carrier of those same bad qualities.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:07.430
Almost as if they impute the quality you are
talking about, from that other person.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:14.120
So, say good things about the people around
you, more important, about the people not

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.260
around you.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:26.560
Your struggles, your sufferings, your failures,
your not-so-great parts of your life.. if

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.670
you are going to anyway have to spill those..

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:36.100
(invariably, every one of us have those dark
chapters in our life), ensure you do that

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:42.450
before they form a conclusive opinion, an
impression about you.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:51.290
Because, most interviewers feel that you created
a “Maya”, you cheated them almost, holding

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.459
the bad news for last.

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:57.240
Put it up front, the author says.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.190
And, finally, he says, Don’t come through
as too perfect.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.970
Nobody wants Superman.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.110
They want a weakness.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.270
They want to be able to relate to you.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.690
If you don’t have that relatability, sorry..
he says.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:22.240
Even when the interview is in progress, there
may be a mistake.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.190
You may spill coffee.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.550
You may have missed doing something that is
critical, crucial.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:34.220
At that time, to apologise, to blow up beyond
limit, to attract the attention of those who

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:41.720
may not even have noticed it in the first
place.. is the wrong thing to do!

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.570
I won’t tell you the episode number!

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:50.110
But, one full episode of Quotidian, I performed
it with my fly open..

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:56.820
After the shoot, I realised it to my consternation.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.000
You didn’t notice it!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.529
Of course, you didn’t notice it..

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:04.230
Things are all fine, until I told you about
it!

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:11.670
So, people are busy, people are full of themselves,
don’t obsess about perfection, don’t try

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.560
to blow up small mistakes that happen matter-of-fact-ly.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.370
That’s the advice he gives.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.519
The second chapter is about Motivation.

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:29.070
Who doesn’t dream of dunking a basketball
like Kobe Bryant?

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:34.540
Go above the level of the ring, and punch
the ball in!

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.630
I have a poster of Kobe at home.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.350
People say this is THE BEST WAY!

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.350
Visualise!

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:50.839
Creative visualisation is THE WAY to find
that ultimate goal.

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:53.519
But, what does our author say?

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:54.519
Sorry, wrong!

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:57.570
Do not fantasise!

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.060
They are not going to help you!

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:06.670
In fact, he quotes research where, if you
fantasise about something, some idol, some

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:15.440
destination, if you do that, you tend to work
less hard!

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.290
Some part of your brain seems to tell the
other part..

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:22.420
“Hey, haven’t we reached our destination
already?!”

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.220
Strange, but that is what is happening, he
says.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.689
Instead, try this!

00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:31.670
He says, take concrete steps!

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.050
We have seen much in this domain.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:40.411
If we are to implement a project, if we are
to execute a plan, remember “Will it make

00:12:40.411 --> 00:12:43.339
the boat go faster?”

00:12:43.339 --> 00:12:45.160
— Concrete is important!

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.139
Cut it up into five parts.

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:53.530
And, if any of those five parts is too large
to handle, cut that one up into five further

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.530
parts!

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.339
And he also says, tell everybody around you.

00:12:57.339 --> 00:13:03.230
Nobody is going to really blame you for not
reaching it.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.640
Probably they won’t even be appreciating
you if you reach it.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.820
But, the fact, simply the fact that you have
told somebody, makes you accountable.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.490
Guess to what extent?

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:18.699
You don’t even need to tell everybody in
the world.

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.329
Whatever is in your mind, just speak it out..

00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:21.530
Whatever you speak out, just write it down.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:29.699
The act of putting pen to paper, writing it
down in concrete physical atoms goes a long

00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:32.320
way, he says.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.529
And finally, he says, surely you are going
to near the eventual goal.

00:13:37.529 --> 00:13:44.240
But, along the way, those highway laybyes
that you encounter along the way, reward youself.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.730
And, reward yourself meaningfully..!

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:57.180
If you are on a diet, just because you have
been on a diet successfully for 21 days, don’t

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.600
treat yourself to a sinfully large sundae!

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.250
You can’t eat icecream sundaes!

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.180
You can reward yourself meaningfully.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:11.899
Something that will motivate you even more
to reach that goal.

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:20.279
That is how you motivate yourself, not by
idle daydreaming and fantasising.

00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:23.950
The next chapter is about… we just finished
daydreaming, this one is about brainstorming.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:29.540
The moment you hear the word, immediately,
you will recall the single most important

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:34.259
advice that we have been repeatedly hearing,
from way back in 1920!

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:35.259
“Come together!”

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:36.259
they say.

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:38.009
“If four or five people come together, it
is unbelievable, how many amazing ideas you

00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:41.310
will be able to generate!”, they say.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.670
Sorry, wrong, says our author.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.860
He says, it is not going to be Groupthink.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.810
You have to come up with the germ of an idea
yourself, and probably for final touches,

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:59.899
and probably for validation and verification,
and probably for remixing with the other person’s

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.079
idea, that might be useful.

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:04.630
But not until then.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.110
An idea is a baby.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.110
Fragile.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.110
Easily choked.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:13.820
You will have to breathe life into it, nurture
it, he says.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.240
And he gives two examples why this Groupthink
should be avoided.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.230
The first reason?

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.660
He calls it “Diffused Responsibility”.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:34.220
He quotes research again, about how they gave
a rope to a single person and asked that person

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.630
to pull hard and lift a weight.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.560
They didn’t tell what that weight was.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:45.149
This person tried, tried, tried, to his level
best, and brought something up.

00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:48.620
Then, five people joined..

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:54.430
They must be able to lift approximately five
times that much?

00:15:54.430 --> 00:16:01.870
They found out, when all five pulled together,
each of them thought that probably the other

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:09.370
person should also bear some of the effort,
probably I am overdoing it, .. and thus, relaxed

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:18.000
a bit, and so, not even five times, not even
four times, just three times the single person’s

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.160
weight was capable of being pulled by those
five people.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.630
What a “Diffused Responsibility” problem,
did you see?

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:34.580
And yes, one more reason why Groupthink doesn’t
work, why when you are asked to do something

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.589
together, you are not able to do that, it
is because you are not able to get instant

00:16:38.589 --> 00:16:39.589
feedback.

00:16:39.589 --> 00:16:42.120
You will notice it when you play tug-of-war.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.440
When playing one-on-one, you will pull and
immediately feel the tension.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.500
But when there are ten on this side and ten
on the other side, teamwork comes into play,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:58.320
orchestration plays an important role, and
there is almost no place for individual thought.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.420
And, for creative endeavours, individual thought
is so important.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.390
Without that, it won’t simply work.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.270
Another tidbit, advice he gives, is to prime
the environment.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:21.510
If you want to be creative, the wallpaper
in your halls can contain something that is

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.049
off the mark.

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:25.110
Something that is non-uniform.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:30.890
He quotes a very interesting research, along
the way.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:37.179
“Come up with creative names for…” is
the task, given to two groups of people.

00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:45.960
The first group of people, before being assigned
the task, are asked to just think about punks,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:55.070
think about rock stars, think about nomads,
and they are asked to write whatever comes

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.780
to mind about them.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.210
And, the other group?

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.059
They are asked to think about mathematicians
and scientists and engineers.

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:03.880
Write whatever comes to mind.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:15.820
Now, having completed the task, “Come up
with creative names for..” they are told.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:22.610
Those who thought about punks, rockstars,
came up with interesting ideas..

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.679
Just priming them.

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:31.150
Green color, he says, primes you better.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:36.850
For generations, human beings have connected
red to blood, blood to danger.. while at the

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:42.520
same time, have connected green to trees,
and trees means fruits, fruits means food!

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:49.960
So, they like green, they hate red, and when
you are panicking, you can’t be creative!

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:56.929
So, priming becomes such an important factor
in your environment.

00:18:56.929 --> 00:18:59.260
Do that!

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.040
The next chapter is about living happier.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.440
How does a family remain happy?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.240
Relationships, friendships, .. how do they
remain happy?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:14.240
Pick up any relationship book, and you will
be immediately accosted by this phrase, “Active

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.240
Listening”!

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.770
He explodes that myth, right away.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:24.750
What is active listening, by the way?

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.080
A says something to b.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.110
And, B responds with, “I have been listening.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.970
I understand what you are saying.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.559
I may not agree with what you are saying,
but I support you..

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:37.559
I empathise with you.

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:38.799
I relate to you.

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:43.539
Now..” and they launch into their own version
of the narrative and argument.

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:47.010
This Active Listening doesn’t really help.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.690
Look at this research.. and the author lists
page after page of antipatterns.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.390
So, what helps, in relationships?

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.930
He says, understand the minutiae.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.530
Learn about the finer points.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.530
Husband.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.530
Wife.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.530
Manager.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.530
Friend.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.530
Relative.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.800
Whoever that may be.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.940
Understand their likes and dislikes to the
minute level.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.929
Do you know their favourite color?

00:20:16.929 --> 00:20:20.809
Do you know the genre of movie they prefer
to watch?

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:24.790
Do you know their t-shirt size?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.910
Talk about these things.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.440
Understand these things.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:37.240
Nothing prepares that relationship with a
better platform than understanding those tiny

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.770
details about that person.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:44.070
And he offers proof too, for that!

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.460
And then he says, partnership is important.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:57.260
A friend, a spouse, whoever that is, there
has to be a partnership based on activities.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.100
Do something together!

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:07.700
They are your husband, they are your wife,
they are your friend, but what do you do together?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.410
Watching TV together doesn’t count.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:14.010
Working in the same company, on the same project
doesn’t count.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.330
What do you do together?

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:22.570
What is that person an activity partner to
you for?

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:29.789
Especially, the body is controlled by the
mind, but the body, in turn, controls the

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:30.789
mind too!

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:36.190
He gives beautiful research-based examples
for this fact too!

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.540
“We like going for walks, we like lazing
around in the beach!”…

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.540
Sorry!

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.670
That doesn’t count, according to the author,
as an activity.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.559
You have to sweat it out!

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:52.070
You have to get your heart pumping faster
than usual for your relationship to bud and

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.289
blossom.

00:21:53.289 --> 00:21:54.510
Why?

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.000
Again, the body controls the mind..!

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.890
When you sweat it out like that, when your
heart goes pumping, deep inside, your subconscious

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:15.860
tells, “Hey, usually, when you are with
a person you really like, I have noticed your

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.090
heartbeat go faster.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.410
Now, your heart is beating very fast..

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.580
Probably, you are with a person you like a
lot!!”

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:33.820
— such is the Causation-Correlation Confusion
that it creates for you!

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.200
Try it out!

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.300
And let me know how it goes!

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.070
And finally, he alludes to a ratio called
Five-To-One.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.120
It was originally cited by Dale Carnegie himself.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:49.880
If a person makes one bitter remark, or offers
one acerbic criticism to another, for that

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:58.610
criticism to completely vanish, for it to
be completely nullified, it is not enough

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.360
if there is one positive remark from the same
person..

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.869
You seem to need FIVE positives!

00:23:06.869 --> 00:23:10.640
That is how bad the game is.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.360
How sensitive our mind is..

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.120
Five to one!

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.120
Remember!

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:27.300
If you shout at a person or get angry, you
need to make amends five times!

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.920
Good advice!

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.390
Again, backed by research!

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.289
He introduces a beautiful word, “But”.

00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:43.159
And, he says, in relationships, among the
thousands that they had surveyed, when they

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:49.950
summarise and look at the big picture to find
out who is happy in the long run, when they

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:56.010
reviewed the recording, the chats, the notes,
the messages, … bubbling through it all

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.760
was a single word, “But”.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:08.540
This word featured in the sentences they spoke
and wrote to each other, about each other.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.180
And, this happened subconsciously..

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.180
“But!”

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.180
What is that “But”?

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:20.490
Instead of stopping with “Husband was lazy..”,
they continued with, “..But we were able

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.900
to joke about it almost everyday!”

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.900
Happy story!

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.990
“Wife was a terrible cook.. but, that helped
us go out so often!

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:32.340
We would indulge every taste bud differently
every time!

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:45.539
If only she had been a good cook, we would
have missed all that!”

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:48.169
“The Manager?

00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:57.460
He was introverted.. but, she had her own
way of showing how much she loved us..”

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.500
That “But”..

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:06.309
Instead of stopping it right there, pivoting
almost 180 degrees, giving it a positive twist.

00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:09.570
Do it, if you get that naturally.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:14.880
And, if you don’t get it naturally, (Remember?

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:22.999
Body controlling the mind?) make your tongue
say it so that the mind learns it, he says.

00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:26.110
Interesting book, I would recommend that you
read it.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.740
But, there are two dark chapters in this book.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.330
One is about dating.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.160
The other is about parenting.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.750
For these two, a myth is exploded, and a less-than-a-minute
tip is giving too.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:46.110
The tips given for Dating..

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.470
I felt they were inappropriate.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.640
It looked like almost cheating!

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.720
I don’t think you need to use such tips.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.000
I wouldn’t want to tell them to you.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.880
The ones on Parenting?

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.590
I want to fight with him about that..

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.870
Because..

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:16.149
parenting, it is a one-on-one game, and I
don’t think tips can really be given generically,

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:19.010
by anybody, to anybody else.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:24.420
So, “I won’t give you..” and “I can’t
give you”!

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.420
Sorry!

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.440
That brings us to the Closing Thought.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.190
We were talking about the Minute.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.390
Just because he has hair on his head, you
may not have recognised this person yet, but,

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.880
yes, same guy, our cult Guru, Seth Godin,
a youth-time photo!

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:42.909
He has said something very interesting about
the Last Minute..

00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:46.070
I would like to close after sharing that.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.690
What’s this Last Minute thing?

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.950
This project you are working on?

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.340
They often say, “Thank God!

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.360
I just finished it in the last minute!”

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.510
Seth says, “Sorry, dear friend!

00:26:55.510 --> 00:27:00.870
The Last Minute is not for DOING IT.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.690
It is not a buffer zone either..

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:07.789
where you put in additional effort to make
up for the unforeseens..

00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:11.899
It is not for you to cross-check and double-check
either..

00:27:11.899 --> 00:27:13.770
No!

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.690
It is not for that either!

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.360
What is it for?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.649
That Last Minute!?

00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:23.830
It is for you to enjoy those sixty seconds..

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.540
Have we completed the project?

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.540
Great.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.750
Now, sit back and enjoy those sixty seconds.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.750
What are we enjoying?

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:35.330
The happiness that comes to us because we
planned well.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.549
We remind ourselves that we planned well.

00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:44.380
That is the sole reason for The Last Minute”,
he says!

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.120
It is the Seth telling us.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.240
We better listen to him!

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.360
We shall meet again, soon!

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.600
Thank you!
