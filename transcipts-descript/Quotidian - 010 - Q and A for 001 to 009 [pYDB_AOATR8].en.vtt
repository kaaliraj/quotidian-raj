00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.589
Namaste!

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.939
The time has come for us to transition from
one-digit to two-digits.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.509
We have reached the tenth episode of Quotidians.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.440
So, I thought, why not take a look back…

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.119
Many of you had sent me messages on Whatsapp
and Facebook and Messenger and Twitter and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.119
YouTube.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.380
Some of them were really interesting.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.560
I just wanted to pick and select a few of
them and offer responses right here.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.560
Let’s get started!

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:38.649
One of them had written to me about 
the elephant-skin reference.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.309
I understand “thick skin”.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.850
But, what do you mean by “sensitivity”?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.870
Does that mean we should be aware of our weakness?

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.870
— He wanted to know.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.270
No, that’s not what I meant.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.430
If you rerun it once carefully, you will realise.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.140
Specifically, all I am saying is the skin
is so thick, but it is also hypersensitive.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.900
It can sense that a mosquito is sitting on
it and it is going to suck blood.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.340
They had such a sensitive skin, that even
though the skin was thick, they could sense

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770
the feet of a mosquito.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.030
So, just because people around you are being
harsh, don’t just shut your ears!

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.100
A well-meaning innocent customer will surely
come along, and you will have to respond to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.100
them!

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.240
So, always be sensitive to customer questions.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.880
That was the point I was trying to make.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.150
Another viewer wondered:- “I had always
thought it was the elephant in the room, I

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.050
didn’t know that even a gorilla was used
to refer to the unaddressed issue”.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.280
Yes, you are right.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.640
If you google for it, you will encounter both
the elephant and the gorilla.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.510
Both are huge animals after all!

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.180
As you can see in this picture, there is an
elephant that is being ignored here.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.420
And, we saw the gorilla being ignored, earlier.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.200
But, the reason I brought that gorilla instead
of the elephant was, well, we were talking

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.510
about the gorilla in the previous video, and
here’s another gorilla…

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.890
Just to bring a sense of continuity.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.190
:-) , I tried to use the gorilla here.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.720
Another person had an intensely profound question
for me.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.050
Amazing, it is really really unique.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.810
It was really good.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.950
But, I have a doubt.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.050
I am keen to know if people watch it fully.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.580
Are you using NVidia broadcast engine?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.010
Or, What tool are you really using?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.010
He had asked.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.320
When he asked if people were really watching,
I decided to go over to YouTube and check

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320
out the numbers.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.980
They have a really pretty statistics engine.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.680
So, it is quite apparent that about 50% is
how much they see.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.870
That is, a six-minute video, for example,
they watch at least three minutes of it.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.490
If you want me to talk about the tools I use,
well, behind me, I have a green screen.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.990
Which is why you see this as a black background.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.190
There is this amazing product called “Mmhmm”
— a product we can run from an Apple Macintosh

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.190
laptop.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.190
Mmhmm!

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.820
And, then, I use a video editor tool called
Camtasia.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.820
All three are quite simple to learn and use.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.190
I have a small bone to pick with the person
who asked me this question about data.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.420
If you remember, I was baying out loud, only
recently, please don’t bother about what

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.850
others think, what others say, will they praise,
will they criticise, just don’t bother!

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.850
Don’t worry!

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.850
Just go ahead, do it!

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.420
That was my clarion call!

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.600
I just feel bad that this person has made
me look it all up so soon after I did that!!

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.970
Anyway.. talking about what others will say…

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.100
Sharan Sharathi, one of my students from last
year.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.850
He wrote to me and questioned me — I saw
the word you had talked about.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.850
Allodoxaphobia.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.850
You had mentioned that “allo” means fear.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.110
Sorry, I don’t think that is right.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.050
Allo actually means “others”.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.140
It is “phobia” that means fear.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.140
Sir!

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.470
Are you trying the usual trick that you do
in class with us?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.960
Are you inserting a buggy puzzle occasionally
just to check if we are listening or not?!

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.960
Ouch — Sorry!

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.600
No Not at all!

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.190
I kinda got carried away.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.790
I made a mistake.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.990
Didn’t realise it.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.390
Thank you for pointing it out!

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.040
Many of you talked about this Olin Miller.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.060
They referred to my comment that no photo
of that man was really available on the web.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.730
They said they searched for it.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.990
And, found out what he looked like!

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.060
Nearly half a dozen of them — sent photos
of Olin Miller.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.430
Two problems though!

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.710
One:- EVERY photo that you sent me features
the same guy in the same pose with the same

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.110
smile and the baldy head.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.560
And, the same quotation too, sitting alongside.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.540
That, by itself, must have clarified to you
that something was indeed wrong.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.820
Thing is, if somebody is indeed very famous,
well, you shouldn’t say he is famous for

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.440
this quotation, and show us that quotation.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.570
Instead, if somebody is very famous, we should
point out how/why he is so famous, and then,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.100
highlight an interesting quotation among the
many things he has said!

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.500
Two:- Did you notice the website?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.500
SantaBanta.com??

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.510
It is a “joke collection” portal.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.690
So, Olin Miller is not like Albert Einstein.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.050
Not like Isaac Newton.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.660
Surely, there is a difference.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.600
Why should we dig deeper into this any way?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.510
He has said something profound.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.050
Let us just take it at face value, and leave
it at that!

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.300
Thirty-Two years later, a person contacted
me.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.300
Hey, do you remember me?

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.300
I watched your video…

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.300
A friend.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.300
An ex-classmate.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.630
So, what is the big deal?

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.449
What have I achieved in this initiative?

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.580
Well, in just nine days, I have been able
to reconnect with somebody after thirty-two

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.580
long years.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.740
That is an amazing opportunity!

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.370
And I need to thank you all for that!

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.260
Thanks a lot!

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.460
Many of you asked me — why are you wearing
the same dress?!?

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.800
Won’t you change the dress at all?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.270
What is the maths behind this?

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.270
Some sequence?

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.270
Some order?

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.780
Well, I wondered if I should just let this
be, change dress once a week, and just move

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.780
on.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.720
I don’t have three hundred and sixty five
sets of dresses anyway!

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.890
To change daily!

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.060
Of course not!

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.970
But one person even shot this point blank
at me!

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.730
Good, but one honest-serving man has only
one question: Why same tee shirt?

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:30.060
:-) So, let me respond to him, and to the
others who asked this question too.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.310
There is no rhyme or reason in this.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.720
If you really want me to take a philosophical
stance on this, focus on the message!

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.780
What am I saying — that should be the thing
you spend your mental energy on!

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.660
Don’t look at what dress I am wearing!

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.400
By the way, because I am speaking here via
video-link, nobody can even guess what I am

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.830
wearing (or not) below my belt, can they!

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.949
So, why should we obsess about this…

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.169
Just let things be.

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.030
Also, I have a little more to share about
this interesting concept, I will talk about

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.510
this on another day in the future, just remember
this picture!

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.080
Ask me later, about this picture!

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.920
A shoe!

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.770
With the letter N emblazoned on it.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.770
Not Z.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.770
But N.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.570
We will talk about this again, soon.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.120
Many of you asked me why I am talking in Tamil.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.040
Why not in English.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.960
You could reach so many more people if you
did it in English.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.180
That was the point so many of you made.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.080
Well.. hmmmm.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.540
Let us understand one thing.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.270
In this world, English is a very popular language.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.610
And there are luminaries out there.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.900
Exponents of both philosophy and the art of
presentation, out there.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.900
I am…

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.900
I am nothing.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.539
I am a candle, when held against them.

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.009
They are brilliant folks.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.259
We lack Tamil content.

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:53.580
I felt I can be the good translator.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.479
There are so many things, amazing things,
from around the world.

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:57.669
I think it was Bhaarathiyaar who said…

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:00.580
I am not able to recall the exact sentences
from that poem.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.919
We will travel the world, and pick and choose
those special gems from here and there, and

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:06.419
introduce it in Tamil, Tamil Nadu.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:13.410
It had even appeared in a movie song — a
Shivaji Ganesan movie song.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.410
So, that is what I want to do.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.810
I am not really creating content here.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:32.060
I just curate, cherrypick, and polish, and
share it here with you after translation.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.029
Another colleague quipped — My wife says
you suddenly sound like Kamal Hassan when

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:38.319
you start talking in Tamil — he laughed.

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:42.240
Who needs any higher credit than this, really,
I wonder.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.579
So, I am really happy.

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:50.639
When I talk about feeling happy, I need to
share something that made me feel really contented

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.639
and satisfied.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:56.200
Many of you pointed out how I was sharing
much here as stuff I heard from my Dad.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.610
Some of them even knew my Dad.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.829
So, many of them wrote back saying it was
like listening to him all over again.

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:05.269
It was so calming and cooling to the mind
and heart.

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:06.269
Really happy.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:14.850
Even those who didn’t know why my Dad was
were sharing that feedback.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.510
That little boy is me, actually.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.510
That is my Dad.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.100
He is no longer with us.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.439
He passed away four years ago.

00:09:20.439 --> 00:09:22.790
But, he is still with me.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.790
Inside me.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.079
Because… the million pieces of advice..

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:36.050
And the gazillion pieces of experience that
he has shared with me, I think that is what

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.589
has made me who I am.

00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:44.600
I am really thankful to him, and I would like
to take this opportunity to say “Thank You,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.600
Dad!”.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:45.850
Namaste!
