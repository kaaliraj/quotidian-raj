00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.370
Namaste!

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:14.300
Quite some time ago, about five hundred years
ago, bakers in England, the ones who prepare

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.134
bread, … the king, the queen, the royalty
would send in an order, and whenever these

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:27.934
people packed a dozen, they wouldn’t send
TWELVE, but would actually send THIRTEEN.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:35.334
No. Not because they wanted to win the king’s,
queen’s favour, by just adding an extra bonus, no!

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:40.300
The real reason was that if the agreed-upon
number didn’t reach the palace correctly,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.867
they were warned of punishment — they would
be beheaded, they would be lashed by whips..

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:45.660
So, rather than take a risk and invite trouble,
they were just throwing that additional extra,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.020
and sending it over.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.730
Which is why, when something is packaged with
an additional something, added beyond what

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.960
was actually asked for, we call it a Baker’s
Dozen!

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:01.200
Bakers used to cheat by reducing weight, increasing
cost, etc.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.479
They implemented a rule.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.060
Bakers circumvented it by just throwing in
an additional something.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.030
Finally, it ended up that bakers got a good
name overall!

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:22.430
Whenever you buy a toy, if you observe it
carefully, if you turn the box around, in

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.480
the back, they would have this printed in
small font.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.700
Batteries, requires three batteries.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.800
Not included!

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.250
Any toy box you look at, this would be the
story.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.630
In fact, I even saw a joke the other day.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.250
As if, you go to the shop one day, to buy
a box of batteries, and… thanks to force

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.950
of habit, what if the box of batteries had
“Batteries not included” printed on it!

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.140
If they start selling batteries, and they
start printing “Batteries not included”!

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:06.260
At my home, when my son was still a toddler,
when I buy a toy like this one, and go home,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.250
my wife will actually be ANGRY with me..!

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.250
Not happy!

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:19.834
Because, when I take that toy out of the packet,
out of the package, my son would want to play right then.

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.460
He would want to enjoy it immediately.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.720
But the package would have instructions: “Charge
for 12–18 hours before first use…”

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:37.459
In fact, Steve Jobs, enraged due to this specific
matter, he declared that day: The iPhone,

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.860
the moment you take it out of the box, the
Apple, in all its smiling bitten glory should

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.860
appear!

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.579
Charge should be around 80% That was the mandate
he had.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.799
That delight you bring to your customers…

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.890
Without forcing them to charge.. is something
special.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.159
I have a childhood experience, like this one.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.620
This is a sweetshop.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.180
I won’t forget his name even now.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.650
His name is Aarumugam.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.049
One day, I go over to buy sweets, and he offers
me samples..

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.049
Do you want this?

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.170
Do you want to try this?

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.840
And he gives me some samples to taste.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.040
We sample it — and my mom asks for a specific
sweet to be weighed and packaged, as she likes

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040
it…

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.879
I have already sampled a bit of it…

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.139
That man weighs out 495 grams into a box.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.659
When we had originally asked for half a kilo
of that sweet!

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.659
Why?

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.969
He supposedly gave me five grams to taste
and sample initially!

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.230
“Enna Kodumai Saravanan?!”

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.680
But…, the same story, played out very very
differently just a week ago.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.730
Consider this one.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.480
I bought an incense-stick stand.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.280
It is about eight hundred and fifty rupees.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.879
It is a nice little bauble, made of marble.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:56.879
Like a tower.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.840
If you place your incense stick or Dasaangam
inside, it will look really beautiful and

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.870
fill the room with fragrance.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.730
But, you know what?

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.019
Inside the packaging, inside that box labeled
Kullicraft, they included four agarbattis.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:21.109
Well, it must have cost them about twenty
rupees, but because they included those four

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:30.620
sticks right inside the packaging, the moment
I opened the package, I was able to use it

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:38.830
instantaneously, I need not, … I wasn’t
forced to go searching for an agarbatti.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.090
Small effort, from the side of the management,
from the side of the manufacturer.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.820
But, remember, I am opening it late at night,
around eight pm, but I was able to instantly

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.889
benefit.

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.060
I would say this was a Baker’s Dozen, right
there.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.580
He had to just send the box.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.770
This comes via Amazon.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.919
Something manufactured by somebody, delivered
by somebody else, through somebody else’s

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.530
warehouse… and eventually it reaches me.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:15.590
But, I was able to use it that moment.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.830
Well, I am not sure how many of you remember
this old man, really.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.300
If you have ever lived in a village, if you
are the type who visits fairs and festival

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.440
exhibitions, you would know.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.030
They used to call it Bambai-Mithai.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.030
Bombay Sweet.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.800
This man would pull it out from under the
frock of that girl-doll.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.730
And, from the candy that comes out, he would
fashion a watch, a balloon, different sorts

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.680
of toys and dolls, none of that will be enough
for us.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:46.510
After everything is done, he will take a small
bit of it and do that to our cheek.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.720
That thing will stick to our cheek and we
will be so thrilled when that happens.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.410
Baker’s Dozen.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.099
Right there.

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.000
This world, is filled with commodity products.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.010
Irrespective of what product you choose to
make, there would be five amazing alternatives,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.700
five competitors, for it.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.540
So, if you want to stand out, if you want
to differentiate yourself, what is needed

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.190
is, the icing.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.539
The packaging.

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.879
The final touch.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.830
The personal twist.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.410
The Baker’s Dozen, that you add.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.520
We think there are all these cakes.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.200
People come to buy the cake.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.990
On top of the cake, we apply the icing.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:37.490
But, today, in this commercialised world,
the icing IS the cake!

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.570
Icing is not on the cake.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.810
People come to buy the cake, we add the icing,
NO!

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.439
The icing IS the cake!

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:47.020
The cake goes without saying.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.490
Everybody expects high quality there.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.180
What do you do on top?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.330
How do you grab the attention?

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.379
How do you hold on to it?

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:01.889
How do you give that customer wow, Aha, Delight?

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.280
All the best, in your own Baker’s Dozen!

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.780
Thank you!
