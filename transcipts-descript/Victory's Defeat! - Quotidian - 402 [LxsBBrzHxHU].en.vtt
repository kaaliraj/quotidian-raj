00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.750
In 1983, India won the World Cup of Cricket.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.109
The Prudential World Cup.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.580
An interesting movie came out recently, about
that tournament.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.180
83 was the name of the movie!

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:24.180
It captures quite a few interesting anecdotes,
little stories, lesser known tidbits about

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.090
what happened, what really happened during
those few months before the World Cup really

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.090
happened.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.239
One thing though, was missed by those who
produced the movie.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.989
I came to know Kapil Dev, even though nobody
even thought he would win a single match there,

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.910
.. he always carried around a bottle of champagne
in his kitbag.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:58.050
From the first day, a bottle of champagne,
in his bag.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.619
When he lifted the World Cup, yes, he had
the opportunity to uncork the bubbly.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.810
But, imagine…

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.600
From Day One!

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.070
That is some confidence!

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.720
Some grit!

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:36.570
What do you think!?

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.570
Namaste!

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.570
Victory’s Defeat!

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.610
Did we win?

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.610
Really?

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.820
Or, have we lost?

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.179
This is one of the chapters in this beautiful
book written by two beautiful people..

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:59.909
Harsha Bhogle, and his wife, who have co-authored
a book called The Winning Way.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.580
It has done so well that they have come up
with a second edition of this book.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.200
The Winning Way!

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.590
In that book, there is a chapter dedicated
to Winning, and all the accompanying emotions,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.690
accompanying benefits, and.. disadvantages
of Winning.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.900
Let us take a quick tour through that chapter.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.790
An unforgettable moment.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.970
If you are an Indian, that is.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.440
If you are Misbah-ul-Haq, this might be an
eminently forgettable moment.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.099
For, he is the batsman who is trying to find
out if he can vanish into the ground by digging

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.101
a hole in the pitch!

00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:38.849
To hide from everybody around him!

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.040
Six runs to get, four balls in hand.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.790
Misbah, an amazing batsman.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.989
A six had just been hit off the previous ball.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.670
2007 T20 World Cup.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.920
And, he tries something, a “scoop shot”,
behind his back.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.250
And Sreesanth catches that.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.739
And India wins the World Cup.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.269
So, Winning, really gives you an amazing..
a heady feeling.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.269
Top of the world!

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.220
After we won that World Cup….

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.379
Till then, people were criticising the Indian
Team.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.019
But, the moment they won the World Cup, that
too, against the Pakistani team, they couldn’t

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.439
do a thing wrong!

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.689
Everything they SAID was RIGHT.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.950
Everything they DI was GOLDEN.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.790
They were literally FLOATING in the clouds.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.599
Winning really gives that heady feeling.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:42.950
In fact, we sometimes think, Team Work — we
should all get together — Team Spirit.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.590
And that will lead to Success.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.459
That is what we think.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.770
If you look at the analysis of Harsha Bhogle,
you will learn that the reverse is sometimes

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.650
true!

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.950
Success BRINGS this thing called Team Spirit.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.312
You can notice this in companies and businesses
too.

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:06.040
A team that is not doing well, that is just
barely getting by, they may have a product

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040
success.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.310
They may probably break through a particular
sales deal.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.069
And, after that, .. almost as if they had
been working together right from childhood,

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.780
the team will rally, the team will work hand
in hand, and achieve great success.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.039
It will make you wonder, that perhaps it is
Success that leads to Team Spirit!

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.490
But, what are the disadvantages, what are
the “Hey, you be careful when you are Winning”

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.030
kinda moments?

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.810
Harsha refers to something called “The Burden
of Winning”.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.610
Oh my god, I have won, what do I do!

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.610
Really?

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.770
Can that really happen?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.889
Yes!

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.180
He brings the example of this guy, Boris Becker.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.610
The youngest ever to win a Wimbledon Open
Tennis Tournament.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.260
He had won it at the tender age of 17!

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.840
And then he went on to win a few more.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:14.050
But, when they interviewed him, … Who are
you, what have you achieved, what are your

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.050
desires…

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.410
when he retired, he is supposed to have said,
“I wish I had won my first Grand Slam later

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.780
in my life.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.620
Not at seventeen and a half.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.009
Because, I didn’t know how to behave like
a Winner.

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.740
Winning is not just about Talent.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.740
It is about Attitude.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.850
It is about Passion.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.690
They all need to work together and form a
work ethic.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.680
Only then, you can be a consistent Winner.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.110
You can be a Winner who gets better over time.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.090
And, I feel I didn’t get the time to do
this right.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.160
That is the feeling I have”.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.090
Said Boris Becker.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.440
Another example.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.440
Closer home.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.970
Remember this guy? 2008 Olympics.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.639
He got India a gold medal in the Shooting
category.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.639
Abhinav Bindra.

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.150
When Abhinav Bindra was interviewed, he said:
“Ouch..

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.240
I have now already won the Gold.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.120
And, I can’t get another medal higher in
value than that one.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.330
All that remains would only be the pressure
to get one more like that.”

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.100
He wrote a poster and stuck it on his wall,
it seems.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:31.400
It said, “You don’t need it, you just
WANT it!”

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.030
What a humbling message to oneself!

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.190
You don’t need it, you just want it.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.759
Now go, look for it.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.360
The Burden of Winning.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.660
We can see this same thing happening in many
companies too.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.280
They come very fast, into the domain.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.300
A feeling creeps in, that they can do nothing
wrong.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:02.090
And then, quarter after quarter, they have
to meet the expectations of the public.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.530
Of the journalists.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.129
Of the customers.

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:07.660
Of the stakeholders and the shareholders.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.879
Of the board members.

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.280
Of the employees.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.120
How do we recapture the amazing magic of the
golden times past?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.050
Apple had the same problem.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.500
Everybody started asking, “What have you
really done, after the iPhone?”

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:29.550
But, hey, an iPhone comes along only once
in a lifetime.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.930
But, will they understand that?

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:31.930
No!

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.930
This guy, his name is Balotelli.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.930
Mario Balotelli.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.290
He is a football player.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.600
Guess what his claim to fame is?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.569
His celebration!

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:43.830
The way he celebrates!

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.320
… He DOESN’T celebrate!

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.349
They asked him..

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:50.050
“Everybody celebrates really wildly.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.560
Why aren’t you doing the same”.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.840
And, he responded: “Does the mailman celebrate
when he delivers the post?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.979
This is my job!

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.490
I am doing my job!

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.639
I have scored a goal.

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.639
What next?”

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.120
You didn’t get it yet?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.800
Okay, watch this video, and you will understand.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.810
How ridiculous it can get sometimes..

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.260
Somebody has done a comedic parody of the
act.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:36.700
So… very often, when you win, you celebrate.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.490
When you lose, you kinda try and do a post-mortem.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.450
But, hey, stop.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.220
Try to flip it around.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.650
Try and do a Post-Harvest.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.710
Launched something successfully?

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.970
What little lessons can you take?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.790
What can you give the next generation to learn
from this Win?

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.760
You’ve won this.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760
Okay.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760
Celebrate.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.810
But, what can you learn?

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.250
What lessons can you learn?

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.300
Can you do that post-mortem even if you haven’t
died?!

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.300
You’ve won the Cup.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.360
Did you sweat and struggle and work hard to
get it?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.920
Or, did you receive it “just like that”?

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.340
To do that, you need to do this.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.340
Analyse it.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.150
Did it land on to your hands “just like
that”?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.170
Some players would exclaim, “I am surprised
that I won!”

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.890
Are you surprised you’ve won?

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.250
Did you expect you would win this?

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.210
Is it a chance happening?

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.170
Did it perhaps rain on that day?

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.890
Was there dew on the outfield?

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.740
Did you win the game only because you lost
the toss?

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.220
What actually happened?

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.620
Was a star player rested, or, perhaps injured,
in the opponent team?

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.330
Was this the reason you won?

00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:01.580
Analysing why you won, knowing the reason
why you won, that is the stepping stone to

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.200
become a true Winner.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.940
Not just in the game, not just in a match,
but in the long run.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.893
In companies, in businesses, it is the same
story too.

00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:15.151
Beyond just feeling happy and celebrating
after your Win, you need to ask yourself the

00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:18.570
hard question, “Why did I Win this time?”

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.360
I wonder why they call it the mile STONE.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:29.060
For, that is the wretched stone that seems
to make so many players trip and fall.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.440
I have “blurred out” his face, so, please
don’t go searching who that cricket player

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.860
could be.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.500
But, it so often happens, that somebody reaches
an important milestone.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.470
Thousand runs in their career.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.090
Or, a century in that match.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.710
But, just four balls later, they will get
out!

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.710
Have you noticed?

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:52.710
Why?

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.160
When you reach that temporary half-way point,
… you haven’t yet reached your goal.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.670
You’ve just crossed a milestone.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:05.620
But, the moment you reach that milestone,
you kinda tend to lower your guard, half of

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:15.140
your mind starts already planning the celebration,
and, you lose focus.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.790
In business, how often have we seen this play
out..!

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.560
When somebody launches a product, they would
declare that the product is going to be amazing,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.730
just by observing the launch reception.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.310
But, hey, are they saying that the product
looks good?

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.060
Or, are they really purchasing the product
by paying money?

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.940
Are they buying it, but keeping it unused
in a cupboard somewhere?

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.730
Or, are they really using it?

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.410
Are they stopping with just using what they
bought?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:47.790
Or, are they going around, eagerly evangelising
that their friends and relatives buy that

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.790
product too?

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.880
Where is that ultimate goal?

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.390
What goal will you be truly pleased for having
achieved?

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.330
What goal is worthy of celebration?

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.150
That is the important question.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:02.621
When you talk milestones, personal milestones,
we can’t avoid talking about this Hundredth

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:03.621
Hundred.

00:12:03.621 --> 00:12:08.230
I thought I would get an opportunity to talk
at length, happily, about it.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:14.110
I even thought I could squeeze it in somewhere,
as a nice footnote.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.980
But, guess what happened?

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.480
When I started searching for this moment…

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.920
In 2012.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:27.081
When Sachin Tendulkar, probably the greatest
cricketer who has played the game, his hundredth

00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:33.100
hundred, One Dayers and Test Matches, he didn’t
get it for one full year.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.160
He languished at ninety nine.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:41.460
Finally, somehow, the stars aligned, and he
got the opportunity to play against a “good-for-nothing”

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.760
team from Bangladesh.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.390
He hit his hundredth hundred that day.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.410
Do you think he is happy about that day??

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.410
Sorry.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.410
No.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:56.360
He is such a cricketing great, such a selfless
player, that he is unhappy about that day.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.360
Why?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.350
For some inexplicable reason, he slowed down.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.930
Near the nineties.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.520
The nervous nineties.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:10.110
He put, temporarily, his personal milestone
ahead of his team’s requirement.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.860
He hit somewhere around 117 runs.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.160
But, he consumed 147 balls.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.500
Almost half the Indian innings.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.500
What happened?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.930
Bangladesh, defeated Sachin, on a day Sachin
hit a century.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.080
A century of centuries.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:36.710
So, when you talk milestones, be it in sports,
or in business, if you are going to talk about

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:42.700
competing against your own team members and
doing something well… or competing team

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:49.380
to team, and trying to get a better revenue
at the cost of the other team losing it…

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.330
what’s great about that??

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.400
This is NOT Success.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.030
One final thing he talks about, Harsha Bhogle,
in that book…

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:10.260
He talks about the differing approaches India
and Australia have, about fiddling with a

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.260
winning combination.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:17.320
In India, if, somehow, they land upon a winning
combination, they won’t dare touch it at

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.320
all.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.360
A Rahul Dravid, a Sehwag, a Ganguly, a Sachin,
are now in place…

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.170
Don’t change them at all.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.360
Don’t change the order.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.260
It is okay if new players come and demand
to be recognised.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Ignore them!

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.740
This combination can’t be touched.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.560
But, hey, these guys are getting old..

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.560
No, that’s okay.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.240
We can bother about it when the time comes.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.940
BCCI would probably go and proclaim in a press
conference, “Sachin will retire WHEN he

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.940
wants to”.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.760
Is that how the Australians handle it?

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.830
The Australian approach is completely different.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.500
Because, they plan for the long term.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.310
They plan to go the distance.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.520
Players will come, players will go.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.310
But, what happens to the Australian Cricketing
Spirit?

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.090
It has to be Winning every time, for a long
long time.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:07.150
So, even when there is a solid winning combination
of four players, they would drop one of them,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:13.750
rest one of them, bring in a rookie who seems
to show a lot of promise, give that person

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:20.360
opportunities to fail, to learn the ropes,
to rub shoulders with these giants, to make

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:26.200
some mistakes, and then ensure continuity.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:32.680
That is why Australia is an all-time great
cricketing team, and India is… yes, once

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:39.560
upon a time great, very soon to be great,
not too great now, and so on…

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.360
Anyway, … closing thought?

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.830
We don’t have one.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.980
This is just the intermission moment.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.430
We are going to meet again tomorrow.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.720
We saw Victory’s Defeat today.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:57.730
Tomorrow, we will read about Defeat’s Victory!

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:06.820
Thank you!
