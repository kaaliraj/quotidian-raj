00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:06.980
In Greek mythology, there is this sorry story
of Pandora’s Box.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.490
A lady, by name Pandora, is “gifted” a
box, a locked box, by God.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.849
To punish her.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.080
To punish mankind, in fact!

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.640
Unable to contain her curiosity, this lady
opens the box, against all instructions, and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.079
out comes sorrow.. disease..

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.809
pain.. regret..

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.530
all kinds of negative emotions and feelings
and demotivating things.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.799
And that is when mankind started suffering,
the story goes!

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:51.329
There is a small side-story too, to this.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.959
She hurriedly locks the box once again, fearing
that she has done something very wrong.

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:04.750
There is a little, faint knocking sound that
she still hears, and she carefully opens it…

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.549
with trepidation.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.310
And the little thing that comes out is the
only good thing… and it introduces itself

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.310
as “I am Hope.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.619
If you have to face all these, and battle
them, and win over them, you need me!

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.619
Hope!”

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:38.900
What is this Pandora’s Box, and how many
Pandora’s Boxes have we opened in this world?!

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.909
Namaste!

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:54.960
Who’s actually responsible!

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.040
Let’s go back in history, let’s look at
some very important moments in history and

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.670
let us ask this question again and again.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.680
This is The Mahabharatha War.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.709
Can you look at it and recognise which particular
moment this is?

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.849
This is the time where Arjuna fights with
Ashwatthaama.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.209
Ashwatthaama is the son of Drona, the Guru
of Arjuna.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:38.750
And, Ashwatthaama is very angry because his
dad, his father, has been assassinated, murdered,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.790
by immoral means.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.610
And, he is challenging Arjuna using immoral
means.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.019
His anger is uncontrollable.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.049
Because his anger is unbearable, he does something
he shouldn’t be doing.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.910
He launches the Brahmasthra.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.230
The “kill-all” most-powerful weapon.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:08.340
This weapon is so powerful that it has been
“banned” from use!

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.580
He sends this out towards the Pandavas.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.950
Arjuna, realising that only a Brahmasthra
can counter another Brahmasthra, sends out

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.480
a Brahmasthra with all respect.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.989
But, as you can see, Veda Vyaasa and Sage
Narada look from above, and say, “This is

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:32.989
wrong.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.930
This will destroy the whole world!

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.280
You shouldn’t be doing this!

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.220
Take it back! Take it back!”

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.370
Arjuna obeys and takes it back.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:53.790
Ashwatthaama wants to obey, but because he
has not learned it properly, he doesn’t

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.329
know to undo what he has done, he says, “I
can’t take it back.

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.390
I have sent it out.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.069
I can only redirect it somewhere else!

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.319
Okay, let me redirect it towards a womb.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.870
The Bala Pandavas..

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.849
The little ones of the Pandavas..

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.550
Let me redirect it to the womb that carries
the progeny of the Pandavas.” and sends

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.190
it to the womb of Abhimanyu’s wife.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.700
He is not able to undo something that he did.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.920
And, to be able to undo is considered the
primary learning you need to have, regarding

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.730
doing something.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.300
Pay attention to that.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.740
Albert Einstein.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.450
He wasn’t part of the Atomic Bomb project.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:00.010
But, he created that original momentum by
discovering that energy and mass are interchangeable.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.660
That cute little equation where E equals mc-squared.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.580
He discovered that from that insignificantly
small atom, unbearable, unimaginable amounts

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.250
of energy can be obtained..

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:22.010
When he realises what Man has done with it…
the advent of the atomic bomb, the bombing

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.290
of Japan, the threat of universal destruction…

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.330
Man had brought the world to the brink of
extinction.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.340
It has changed everything..

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.730
Atomic energy has changed everything, except
Man’s way of THINKING.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.740
It hasn’t changed his idiocy alone.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.280
Concerned about it, regretting what had happened,
he is supposed to have said, “Had I known,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:06:01.190
I would have become a watchmaker!”

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.280
Had I known…

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:14.000
Genetic Engineering is the central, focal
theme of the famous book, Jurassic Park.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.290
A book by Michael Crichton.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.870
It appeared as a movie too.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.830
The movie is probably more famous today, but
the book is simply amazing as a science fiction

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.220
story where the science is stranger than fiction.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.400
Everything that the book talks about is actually
possible today.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:44.590
Having written such an amazing book, the author
talks about a mosquito that bites a dinosaur,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:52.880
and an amber drop imprisons the mosquito,
and scientists extract the dinosaur blood

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.640
from inside the mosquito, they do genetic
magic, and recreate the dinosaur.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:09.901
But, before the story gets into Jurassic Park,
the author tells, as a prologue, that scientists

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:17.740
have already started engineering trout to
be lighter coloured so that fishing is easier.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:28.090
Today, they are engineering trees to not be
circular, and instead to be square in cross-section

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.500
because it is easy to make them into lumber.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:38.140
And, if you are a Big Bang Theory watcher,
you will remember that there is a story where

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.500
Sheldon tries to grow a glowing goldfish.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.650
Silly, harmless experiments, one would think.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.950
But, do you remember what happened at The
Jurassic Park?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.120
It started as a silly, harmless scientific
experiment.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.780
But, they didn’t know how to undo what they
had done.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.420
I don’t want to glorify these two people
by telling you their names.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.010
They are a husband and wife pair.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:22.060
And, in a place called San Bernardino, in
2015, these two terrorists opened fire..

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.640
They were a husband and wife pair who worked
in a medical institution — they opened fire

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.150
on their colleagues.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.930
Fifteen people died.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.610
Sixty others were badly injured.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.070
They got away in an SUV.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:45.790
They were chased by the police, and unable
to capture them alive, … the police shot

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.680
them dead.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.610
Among the many things the police discovered
in their house — they see a lot of armaments,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:09:03.100
enough to start a small war, one quips — among
those things, they also discover an iPhone.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.620
Unfortunately, it is locked.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:18.830
And, that was the story of how the FBI tried
to arm-twist Apple into unlocking the phone

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:19.830
of this dead man.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.098
They are hoping that hidden inside the iPhone
are details about who he has messaged, what

00:09:22.098 --> 00:09:25.949
terrorist networks he has called, etc.

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:30.170
And, the FBI wants it.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:35.439
They know that ten failed tries will automatically
lock the phone and auto-erase all content

00:09:35.439 --> 00:09:36.439
in it.

00:09:36.439 --> 00:09:39.029
They want a backdoor into it.

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:48.870
We need to protect the country, the FBI tells
Apple, and you need to help me do that.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:55.160
Apple empathised with the victims of San Bernardino.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.800
But Apple said, “Sorry, I cannot unlock
that phone.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.940
I can’t write software that will compromise
my own software.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:15.290
If I give a backdoor, if I give a key just
for the government to use, it is easily possible

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:23.810
that a thousand more hackers will come and
prey upon not just the bad guys, but on so

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.779
many other good guys.

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:28.310
Privacy will become a thing of the past.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.759
We cannot do it”.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.310
That was the stance Apple took.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:41.460
Became a raging court case, and eventually
Apple didn’t budge, it did get a bad rap

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:48.450
from the government, but if today, Apple is
famous for its security and privacy, it is

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.060
because of the epochal moment that started
then.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.430
“Once opened up, it is like the Pandora’s
Box.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.279
We have no idea who will end up using it for
what.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:02.550
There is too much grey.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:14.769
And, so, let me be black and white, I can’t
open it.

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:16.249
Sorry!”

00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:20.110
Zuckerberg launched the Metaverse recently.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.170
That is probably his greatest leap forward.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:28.949
Such a great leap, in fact, that he has rechristened
his company itself from Facebook to Meta.

00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:33.190
He calls it his new focus.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:39.600
He says this is the New Web.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.319
He is investing billions of dollars.

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:44.300
A lot of his mindtime.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.720
All of his energy.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:56.430
Right in the welcome note itself, realising
that he is actually opening yet another Pandora’s

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:03.460
Box, remembering that the last time he was
in the news, it was because of an image-tarnishing

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:09.959
court case… the government wanted to know
what he was doing with user-data..

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:12.260
Did he sell it?

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.440
Did he make money off it?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.100
Did he violate user privacy?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:32.610
The 
government vilified and lacerated Mark Zuckerberg!

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:41.920
And, knowing that privacy and Mark are not
really connected deeply, Zuckerberg tried

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.350
to reset and this is what he did.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.779
He said, “We are launching the Metaverse.

00:12:51.779 --> 00:13:01.120
And, from now on, whatever else we launch
too, we will follow responsible innovation

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.120
principles.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:07.290
These are those principles, and we will follow
them to the letter”.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.250
And, he cites four principles.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.850
Principle Number One:- Never Surprise People!

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.080
We have encountered multiple times in earlier
Quotidians, the exact opposite of this.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.120
Delight your customers.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.149
Surprise your customers.

00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:20.629
Let your users discover and stumble upon things.

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:23.019
But, all that is for conventional software.

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:26.170
Here, the world is completely new.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.010
They don’t even know what world they are
getting into.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.580
The augmented reality, the virtual reality.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.300
Lots of data is getting collected.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.300
Continuously.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.850
So, he says, “We will collect all data transparently.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.709
There will be tradeoffs.

00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:49.920
To get something, you may have to give up
something.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.350
And so on.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.600
But, we will explain it to you.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.451
And, you are entering a new world, so, we
will teach you every step of the way how to

00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:05.699
be safe, and how to be responsible in this
world.

00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:10.730
We will not surprise you.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.639
We will tell you everything that is going
to happen.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:16.749
It may reduce some delight.

00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:26.410
But, this is important, because we want to
be responsibly innovative”.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.319
Principle Number Two:- Provide Controls That
Matter!

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:31.639
What does that mean?

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:38.010
He says, “Please understand that this world
you are getting into, what is a virtual reality

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.149
experience, what is a metaverse, it is still
developing.

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:42.639
We don’t know everything yet.

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.119
You don’t understand everything either.

00:14:44.119 --> 00:14:50.139
Only from now on, bit by bit, we are creating
this world together.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:58.730
And so, as these expectations are still developing,
we will provide you controls every step of

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.140
the way, we will allow you to set personal
boundaries…

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.980
If you enter a specific world, we will alert
you about what information you are going to

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.980
be sharing…

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.160
What has to be shared, what need not be shared,
what should not be shared…

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.529
We will let you control all these.

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:18.600
Because, that is this new world you are getting
into.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.889
We will innovate responsibly, we will provide
you controls that matter”.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:28.149
Principle Number Three:- Consider Everyone!

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:30.040
This one really wowed me!

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.689
I felt this was an amazing insight!

00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:34.959
What have we studied till now?

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:36.750
Don’t just build the product.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.310
Look at the user.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.619
Find out more about the experience they are
going through.

00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:46.149
And, where it can be improved.

00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:54.629
But this guy is saying, “Hey, you are creating
software for a new world.

00:15:54.629 --> 00:16:01.509
You are creating software for a world where
your software will touch non-users!

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:05.120
Take a camera for instance.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.939
Does the camera “trouble” only the person
with the camera?

00:16:10.939 --> 00:16:18.600
It impacts even that common man seated under
that tree, who says he has nothing to do with

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.110
a camera and wants nothing from it.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.081
This camera intruded into his life.

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:26.899
The same thing happened with a cellphone.

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:29.629
You are listening to a concert.

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:32.420
And, you don’t even have a cellphone.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.910
But, that ringtone intruded into your world.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:45.759
And, much much more than the intrusion that
a cellphone and a camera brought in the physical

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:53.670
world, the mischief you do in the metaverse
will intrude into the world of people who

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.699
are not even in the metaverse.

00:16:56.699 --> 00:16:59.250
And so, consider everyone!

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:05.100
Consider even those who don’t even use your
product!”

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:11.010
I thought this was a truly amazing insight!

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.360
Consider everyone!

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.710
Innovate responsibly!

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:24.050
And, finally, the fourth, .. I wonder if this
should be the first one or the fourth…

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.460
The principle is:- Put People First!

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.830
You are running a business, calling it the
metaverse…

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.320
Surely, you would be doing something that
brings your business some profit.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.000
And, surely, you would be doing something
that benefits the individual end customer.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.650
And, perhaps, your work may even have an impact
on the society at large.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.970
So, Business Impact.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.120
Individual Impact.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.120
Societal Impact.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:59.380
He says, “We will prioritise it, and we
will always put the greatest good for the

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.830
greatest number in the community first.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.930
And then, the greatest good for the individual
next.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.880
And, only later, business profit will be considered.”

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.382
Altruistic, you may want to call it.

00:18:14.382 --> 00:18:19.310
Perhaps Mark is alluding to the famous Sanskrit
saying, “Paropakaaraartham Idham Shareeram”

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.700
— This whole body of mine, this life of
mine, is to be spent in the service of others!

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.260
But, it is not a win-loss kind of zero-sum
game.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.679
There are countless examples of businesses
that thrive even while doing great good for

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:37.840
the world, as well as helping the individual
customer truly benefit from the product.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:45.900
Mark seems to say that he is headed in that
direction, with Meta.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.530
So, four beautiful principles.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.300
Timeless principles.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:59.390
Which we can just borrow from Meta, and imbibe
in our own product design, is what I would

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.440
like to say.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.230
As a closing thought, there was this beautiful
quote I bumped into.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.060
A science-fiction fantasy sort of book.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.640
Robin Hobb had mentioned this in this book
titled “Assassin’s Apprentice”.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:22.390
You need to perhaps read it twice to understand,
but it was lovely.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:31.430
“Don’t do what you can’t undo, until
you’ve considered what you can’t do once

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.630
you’ve done it”!

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:43.680
Before doing something, evaluate all the things
you can no longer do if you do this thing,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.090
analyse, weigh the options, and then do things!

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.780
We will meet again next week.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.430
Until then Namaste!
