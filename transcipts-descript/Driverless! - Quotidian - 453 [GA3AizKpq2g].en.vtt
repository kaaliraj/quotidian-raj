00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.529
Look at these quotes.

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:10.530
If you don’t DRIVE your business, you will
be driven out of business..

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.620
Or..

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.830
Let passion DRIVE your profession.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.560
Oprah Winfrey.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.160
Here’s one more.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.760
Attitude DRIVES actions.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.429
Actions DRIVE results.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.420
Results DRIVE lifestyles.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.070
So nice to hear!

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.370
But, before I could locate these nuggets,
the struggle I had to go through…!

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:48.199
It is tough, because, when you search on Google
for “Self-Driven”, you get CARS everywhere!

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:59.530
That is what we are going to see today!

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.090
Namaste!

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.909
Four hundred and fifty three.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.470
Driverless.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:22.870
About this concept of driverless cars, of
late, there has been a lot of … no.. not

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.320
hype.. lot of news.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.579
Real driverless cars.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.680
Cars that require very little attention.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.619
Cars that can go by themselves in a highway
or enclosed campuses..

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.229
A lot of talk!

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:49.490
When we dig a little deeper about this, I
learned that there are six levels of automation..

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.890
Or, automatic, driverless mobilisation in
cars..

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.850
What are those six levels?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.229
Well, these technology-folks?

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.650
They like starting the FIRST level from ZERO!

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.479
Level ZERO.. well, even our oldest cars are
Level ZERO.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.980
You have to do everything from steering, driving,
accelerating, everything.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.629
Level ONE?

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.629
Feet OFF.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.370
You don’t need to accelerate, brake, some
of the things it will take care by itself,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.739
but you need to give top-level guidance, directions,
and big picture appraisal..

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.780
Then, you take your hands OFF.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.780
Level TWO.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.360
You don’t need to lay your hands on it too..

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.159
There will still be a steering wheel.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.930
But, it will have a map, it will know where
it has to go, know who is in front, it is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.930
monitoring everything all the time..

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.120
If there is an emergency, if a child crosses
the road suddenly, if a donkey comes up front,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.750
you may have to jump in.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.659
Emergency Management.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.930
But, it pretty much takes care of itself.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.980
Hands OFF.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.019
Then, you go to eyes OFF.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.019
Level THREE.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.019
You don’t need to even LOOK.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.019
You can read a book.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.019
You can SLEEP.

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.150
You can chitchat with a friend.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.049
That is Level THREE.

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:18.730
There, it even manages exceptions, but probably
manages it poorly, you can wait to be called..

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.459
You may have to override it sometimes, it
may do things wrongly, occasionally!

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.670
But, it is eyes OFF.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.690
Level FOUR is Mind OFF.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.810
You needn’t pay attention at all.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.420
You can just settle down cozily, with a book!

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.420
Look at that chap!

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.420
No feet on pedals.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.420
No hands on steering wheel.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.890
Eyes off the road.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.320
You can be at ease.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.269
But yes, it happens only in controlled environments..

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.400
It is truly liberating.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.470
Override is available for you.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.989
You may want to jump in.

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.710
For optimal performance, not for saving somebody,
but for optimising the performance.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.900
Finally, after the Mind OFF level, is Level
5.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.460
We don’t need you!

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.930
Human becomes PASSENGER!

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.799
It won’t even have a steering wheel!

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:20.799
No hands.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:21.799
No eyes.

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:22.799
No feet.

00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:23.799
No driver seat even!

00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:26.290
The car seems to say, “I am fully capable
of handling myself!”

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.290
Autonomous.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.130
And, the car is a better driver because it
is learning all the time!

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.550
AI comes in!

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.550
Nice!

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:46.800
While I was observing these six levels, I
couldn’t help but bring back to mind, that

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.059
famous book we have seen — DRIVE!

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.660
— it is not about cars!

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.650
This is about careers!

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.170
This is about what motivates people!

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.400
This is about what DRIVES people!

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.870
And, as I have been warming my ass as a manager,
for quite a few years now, I was able to draw

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:19.069
some parallels between this world of autonomous
cars and my probably-more-accustomed-world

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.920
of people being managed by people.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.480
These same six levels of progression in a
person’s career…

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.020
Using the same slides…

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.539
Shall we go for a ride?!

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.720
Level ZERO.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.360
The Manager is the DRIVER.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.650
A person joins a job.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.650
Fresh.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.650
First job.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.360
What is to be touched, what shouldn’t be
touched, what is to be implemented, and how,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.569
when to slow down, when to accelerate..

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:54.569
everything!

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.590
It is micromanaged by the Manager.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.760
Not only that, they handhold you.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.030
They guide you through every step — how
it is to be done.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.580
You are probably learning but they handhold
you through every step.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.560
They give you guidance, as well as control.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.850
The Manager is the Moving Force.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.150
That is Level ZERO.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.880
The Manager is the DRIVER.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.190
You are just the dumb vehicle.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.010
Hoping for better times.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.069
Level ONE is Feet OFF.

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:39.090
The Feet is the accelerator and the brake,
mostly.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:49.479
The Manager is still guiding you, giving you
directions, probably giving you the big picture,

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:57.330
a sense of things, “Hey, this is how you
do it, this is not to be done thus..”

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:09.770
They are also letting you take care of it
during a free traffic-less late-night or very-early-morning

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.229
nobody-on-the-streets..

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:15.979
They give you SOME Cruise Control.

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:17.199
Oh, this is hassle-free.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.979
You just have to push forward straight!

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:26.199
And, when the going is straight with no surprises,
“Sir, may I try it for a bit”, “Madam,

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:35.139
may I get your permission”, is what you
do, and Feet OFF is what they do.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.020
Next Level is Hands OFF.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.330
“I am not going to give you direction either!

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:49.479
I have already taken my feet off the pedal,
and now I am saying, ‘Let me see you take

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:56.300
it in the right direction?”

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.300
I will be monitoring!

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.300
Are you driving safely?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.520
Are there any unexpected obstacles cropping
up?!

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.780
Environment, I will be monitoring.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.770
Because, you will be busy with the controls.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.409
You are still learning the tools of the trade.

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:09.000
The way the game is played.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.569
But, I will keep monitoring.

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:17.680
I won’t put my hand on the steering wheel.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:24.740
I will be ready to jump in.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.340
The moment there is a problem, the “Emergency
Handling System” kicks in, and I am ready

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.240
to handle any emergency!”

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.719
That’s Level TWO — Hands OFF.

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.360
What’s Level THREE?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.560
Level THREE is Eyes OFF.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.861
“I have given it to you.

00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:43.861
I have surrendered it to you.

00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:48.260
You take care of it.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.240
That is Eyes OFF.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.670
What happens in Eyes OFF?

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:58.050
You manage exceptions when you are called..

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.970
Are you the Manager?

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:08.269
Do people who work with you give up and raise
their hands asking for help and assistance?

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:11.329
That is when you come in.

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:13.329
That is when you dive in.

00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:16.250
And you manage that exception.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:23.140
In the world of traffic, it could be an old
man suddenly deciding to cross the road.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:30.700
In the world of business, it could be an angry
customer, a customer who has been with you

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:40.230
for a decade perhaps, righteously angry, complaining
about something, and you needing to do some

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.490
firefighting.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.540
And finally, “Dear Friend, please leave
this to me.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:53.590
I will take care” — says the Manager sometimes,
and takes the wheel.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:59.440
That’s Override — sometimes, it may be
needed.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.450
Level FOUR is Mind OFF.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.470
“Did I give this job to you?

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.300
Did I ask you to do this?!

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.300
Thank you!

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.300
Looks like you have finished it all by yourself!

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.300
Wow!

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.920
You have done it better than I had expected!

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.160
Very good!”

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.709
That’s Mind OFF.

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:18.750
In the Mind OFF world, override is available.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.670
The employee says, “You can take over, any
time you want, dear Manager”, and the Manager

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.460
is smug in the confidence that they can take
over any time they want..

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.750
It is available.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.380
But, hardly ever used.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.720
And, it is done mostly in controlled environments.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:44.779
Even today, autonomous cars they can do very
well in roads that have barricades on the

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:49.210
left and the right.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.690
The assurance that cattle won’t crossover
suddenly, that a child won’t flit by chasing

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.000
a stray ball, that sort of controlled environments..

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.250
Or, probably in Mars and the Moon, where there
is open space, “I can do very well”.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.839
In “time-critical” companies, they use
a term..

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:13.450
BAU they call it.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.019
Business As Usual..

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:16.589
Should just continue.

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:22.710
Come rain or shine, or even an earthquake.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:31.029
In such controlled environments, Level FOUR
people can do very well.

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:34.790
That’s truly liberating for the Manager.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:43.029
If a Manager can elevate the people who work
with them all the way to Level FOUR, that

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:45.140
is literally Nirvana.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:54.209
You have reached a stage where you are liberated,
you are rendered a lot of extra time to do

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:56.830
the next amazing thing in your list.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.420
But, wait, there is a level even beyond this.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.450
Level FIVE.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.010
In which, the Manager becomes the PASSENGER.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.600
I think this deserves some deep thought.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:22.250
In today’s fast-paced world, the reality
is, most Managers don’t know that specific

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.089
trade well enough.

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:27.329
So much has happened.

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:30.709
So much churn has happened.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.430
So many new things have cropped up.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.670
The Manager is still vitally important, because
they have WISDOM.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.960
But, KNOWLEDGE?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.930
That is the keep of the newly joined folk!

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.050
The Level FOUR Mind OFF People.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:55.040
Only when you transition from Level FOUR to
Level FIVE, you become that truly invaluable

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.889
10X employee.

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:00.720
What happens at Level FIVE.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.139
You become fully capable!

00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:05.930
You become sentient.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:06.930
You become..

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.320
like they say, the AI Singularity..!

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.160
That is the position you reach.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:22.690
When you are fully capable, something changes
suddenly, and your learning potential, your

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.320
ability to learn by looking left and right,
by looking at other people following that

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.720
same path, … that is why Google Maps is
able to show you a traffic-snarl so beautifully

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.250
and promptly as a river of blood overlaid
on a line of blue.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.250
How?!

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:46.210
Hundreds of travellers, if they have followed
the same path, at similar times, and suffered

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.980
similar trouble, it learns!

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.880
What is the right optimum speed with which
I can cross this bridge?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.470
It learns.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:01.790
This kind of vehicle suddenly accelerates,
I need to be careful when trailing it..

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.790
It learns.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.670
And, it doesn’t keep quiet just learning.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.529
It shares!

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:11.480
With anybody else interested in learning!

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:22.720
If you can bring together employees like these
in your team, you are already in heaven!

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.420
It is autonomous!

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.120
It takes care of itself!

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.519
That book, Drive, it talks about the sense
of autonomy..!

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:34.540
I am doing this..

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.580
I was interested in doing this.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.430
And, because of my interest, I chose to do
this all by myself.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.120
That lights the fire.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:52.170
And, finally it is a better driver than the
Manager could ever dream to become!

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.380
That is in the traffic world.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:02.610
And, in the business world, it is a better
performer than the Manager was, ever.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:08.519
That was the aim of the Manager all along!

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:16.139
The Leader wants to create people who can
render them obsolete.

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:21.179
Who can tell them, “Thank you for the trust
you placed in me..!

00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:25.810
Thank you for tending to me along these six
levels..

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.440
Now, let me take care of you!”

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.220
We saw SIX LEVELS.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.940
I want to share three learnings from these.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.550
Be it for driving a car, or managing a team.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.120
Three learnings.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.079
Number One — Monitoring is important.

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:51.819
Looking around.

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:54.389
Observing the environment.

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:56.880
What is happening around you.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.900
Taking it in.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.900
Observing.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.900
Processing what was collected..

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.900
This is just a tree.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.670
This is a person, standing immobile, like
a tree.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.700
This is water.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.980
This is a child’s image reflected on the
water surface.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.339
That processing.

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:15.310
And, having processed that, what should be
my reaction.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.920
The same, in the business world.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.529
What is the competitor doing?

00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:20.980
What is the customer doing?

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.800
What is my teammate doing?

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.569
What is my Manager asking?

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:32.759
Taking those matters in, prioritising them,
what action is needed for which, where is

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:36.430
inaction perhaps the best action,..

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.430
Monitoring..

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.230
The second learning is about Exception Handling.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:46.620
Today, in India, nobody really talks about
the autonomous cars..

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.040
And the reason?

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.570
Traffic!

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.310
It is not heavy traffic that we are afraid
of..

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.660
It is the chaotic, unpredictable traffic..

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.030
We need to learn to handle that traffic.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.230
That is Exception Handling.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:14.730
Similarly, as the business grows, you will
realise that the world is not in your control.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.929
Human beings are fickle souls.

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:20.980
Suddenly, a very happy customer may turn unhappy.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:28.220
Suddenly, an opponent, a competing company,
that had been badmouthing us all along, might

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.070
want to merge with us?

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.090
These are all exceptions!

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.630
How do you handle that?

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:44.460
And, finally, the hallmark of a good driver,
the hallmark of a good employee, is Continuous

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.460
Learning.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:53.590
To learn by yourself, and to be ready to receive,
when others who have learned other things

00:17:53.590 --> 00:18:03.750
want to offer their learnings to you, … That
is what makes a rickety old Model T into a

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.130
WayMo Google Car.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.260
The Closing Thought is from this book.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:16.240
It is called Being Digital, published in the
late nineties.. by this man, Nicholas Negroponte.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.539
Founder of the Media Lab at MIT.

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:29.220
The person who seeded the AI revolution, a
supremo of Virtual Reality.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.770
He lays forward a beautiful puzzle in that
book.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:42.110
He says, “The coming years will be a competition
between two aspects.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.720
One — is transportation.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.059
The other — is communication.

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:51.780
Both are growing very fast.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.720
Communication was slow, unpredictable.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:19:05.110
But, with the advent of the Internet, we see
video calls, soon virtual presence, communication!

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.130
Transportation?

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:13.840
From cars to jet planes to hypersonic flight,
is moving very very fast.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.280
Both are progressing very fast.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.600
But, interestingly, one person will win this
race.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.690
And, destroy the other.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.360
Make the other unnecessary.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:35.290
If the communication is so good, I may not
want to travel at all.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.830
That is what is happening in today’s remote-presence
world!

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:45.460
If I can travel as fast as I want, when I
want, why would I need communication networks?!

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.350
I will be there!

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.809
Don’t you agree?!

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:53.110
Alright, we will meet again next week..

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:59.180
We will communicate!

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:05.559
Meanwhile, don’t go away!

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.279
Thank you!
