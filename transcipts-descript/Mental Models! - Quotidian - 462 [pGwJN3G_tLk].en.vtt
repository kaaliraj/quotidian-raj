00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:09.760
I’m sure you can relate to this unique phrase
in Tamil?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.849
“Podaa Mentalu”! “Naan konjam Mental”!

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:25.359
But, the truth is, even in England, the birthplace
of English, this phrase, Mental, is used too..

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:44.800
Not just as a synonym for “loony” or “crazy”
but also “insane” and “unbelievable”.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:01:06.150
For example, these scenes from the Harry Potter
movie series!

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.650
Unbelievable!

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
Not insane!

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.640
But, unbelievable!

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.990
The “Mental” that we are going to see
today are not these sorts of Mentals.. but,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.560
we are going to see something called Mental
Models.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.710
Come along.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.850
Namaste!

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:51.570
Four hundred and sixty two!

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.920
Mental Models.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.979
No, not that kind of mental.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.460
But, mental.. the way we think.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.340
What is a mental model?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.290
When you start researching, .. this picture
and this definition come everywhere.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.410
The way you absorb and enjoy the world around
you.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.459
You don’t touch anything.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.260
You don’t really see anything.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.900
You don’t really smell.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.060
You don’t perceive.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.120
Nothing happens.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.730
The only thing you do is, receive all this
input.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.870
And you keep it on one side in your brain.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.370
Keep it in one blank space.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.090
And you search in your mind, .. what does
it resemble?

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.230
What is it like?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.560
What is it reminding me of?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.090
What works for this?

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.090
And so on.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.090
And on.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.420
You search, you rummage, and you discover
that there is a pattern that you have already

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.230
experienced, and you match it.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:09.870
And, only after the pattern is formed, “Oh,
this is a lion”, “Oh, this is my loving

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.999
wife”, “Oh, this is edible”..

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:13.549
That is what happens.

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:21.370
And, in more complex levels, “If this is
the scenario, this is the right response appropriate

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.390
for it..”

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.450
“Aha, this is dangerous.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.530
I need to be aware”.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.800
That is the fundamental explanation.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.950
What is a mental model?

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.680
It is the explanation of someone’s thought
process.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.420
The way we understand how the world works?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.500
It is really based on your mental models.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.959
Mental Models..

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.360
What can it be a model of?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.140
It can be a model of a business.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.000
Amazon is an online marketplace where people
can buy stuff.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.450
Zoho, that again is a mental model.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.590
Can I use just a browser, connected to the
internet, to run my business?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.080
That again is a mental model.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.760
How do they help their customers achieve their
needs, how do they make money.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.180
It could be a model of a complex tool.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.600
How does this tool work?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.660
Where do I hold it?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.910
What does it need as input?

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.229
What will it achieve for me, as an end result?

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.620
That mental model needs to reside in your
mind.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.470
It could be a mental model for a recipe.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.320
This is the end product..

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.320
Ratatouille.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.550
How does one cook that?

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.570
What are the steps?

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.960
It could be a procedure.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.880
Or, it could even be a mental model of a state
of mind.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.479
What is happiness?

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.550
What is satisfaction?

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.669
What is jealousy?

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:58.669
What is anger?

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.669
What is fear?

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.780
All these exist as mental models inside our
mind.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.990
Every one of us has a mental model for everything
that we perceive in this world.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.720
Is it the right model or not?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.860
Do we have very few models in our mind, or
do we have many?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.370
That is where the distinction comes between
the performer and the also-ran.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:30.780
Take for instance, a person not happy at work.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.080
He is not able to make ends meet.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.290
Not enough money.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.740
What can he do?

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.000
What are all the options available for him?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.160
A mental model leads you to take a decision.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.030
A limited mental model will make him go to
his boss, and say, “Boss, I need a raise.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.410
I am performing better.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.880
The company is doing well.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.990
I think I deserve more”.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.120
Might work out, might not work out.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.730
But that is the extent to which his mental
model helps him.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.349
What else could he do?

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.270
He could jump jobs.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.530
That is a paradigm shift.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.020
A quantum leap.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.670
From this job, a different domain, a different
company, a different kinda job.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.400
A different model.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.099
It could even be that he has a Growth Mindset.

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.030
An entrepreneurial mindset.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:38.160
A different mental model, that allows him
to wonder, “Why should I work FOR somebody,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.639
when I can be my OWN boss!?”

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.780
And that’s when he comes up with an idea
and waters it.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:53.310
Beyond all this though, if the person has
the right mental model, he may probably ask,

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.880
“Why, Why, Why, Why am I doing this?”

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.600
And at the end of that pursuit, he might realise,
“What I actually need is simplicity in my

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600
life..

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:14.050
If I can keep my needs and wants in check,
..I don’t need to be on this hamster wheel.”

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.030
That also is a mental model.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.699
So, a mental model, that you are born with,
that you grow into, is going to play a key

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.720
role in every decision you take.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.210
Without mental models?

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.270
Or, if you aren’t well-versed in USING the
mental models that you have?

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.310
Guess what will happen?

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.620
We have read about this System 1, System 2,
remember?

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.540
You won’t let your System 2 really help
you take your decisions.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.510
And, so, two important problems.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.620
First one, your decisions would be based on
Momentum.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.220
“This is how I have been doing it for so
far.., why not I just continue like that a

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.220
little longer?”

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.889
Sunk Cost Fallacy.

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:02.759
That again is a mental model, by the way!

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.490
“We have come this far, why not go a little
longer?!

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:13.500
To turn around requires overcoming inertia,
I am not sure I would want to do that.”

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.770
You make this mistake if you are stuck without
the right mental model.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:24.850
Again, one more mistake you do when you don’t
have the right mental model, is that you press

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.380
the panic button.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.069
When you press the panic button, you act instinctively.

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:37.200
Your animal, your lizard brain takes over.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:45.820
You are not allowing your intellect, your
primate brain, your slow-thinking better-deciding

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:54.209
brain to play a role to salvage you from the
situation, from the hole you have dug yourself

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:55.209
into.

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:57.440
So, mental models are important.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.170
Let us take an example.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.990
The design of an AC remote.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.990
I have a pet-peeve.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.730
I always wonder, which “distilled idiot”
has designed this device.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.209
I will always be rankled whenever I see such
remotes.

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:24.010
For, my mental model of a remote came from
a TV volume control, a contrast and brightness

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:32.430
control, where UP meant “brighter”, “more”,
“more”, “higher”, “larger”, “more”!

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:38.240
And, in an AC.. what is MORE?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.600
What is the AC’s job?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.959
The AC’s job is to cool the environment
I am in.

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:46.149
“More cool”..?

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:47.250
Nope.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.019
No AC works like that.

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:59.300
When you press the UP button in an AC, it
is the temperature control, and it gets WARMER.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.610
You see the clash of mental models?

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:08.720
I come with a mental model, the designer who
has designed something, has some other perception

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.360
of the mental model, and hence, friction.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.700
Even worse, there are remotes that just say
Minus, Plus, without any indication of what

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.700
it is about.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.899
You will know only after you try it..

00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:22.250
Whether it is temperature or cooling!

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.610
We have read this as Jakob’s Law.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.940
It means, basically, “Do what everybody
else is doing, please.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.380
Don’t do something unusual and unique, after
hours of deliberation in a private room; don’t

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.990
do it differently, just because you wanted
to do somebody nobody else had done!”

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:45.399
Because, how much ever they are in love with
you, they spend time, a lot more time, elsewhere.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.870
They could be your husband or your wife.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.870
Could be your friend.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.200
Could be your cellphone, even.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:11:03.910
Whatever it may be, whoever it may be, even
if you love it the most, love them the most,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:11.260
if you count all the other time you spend
elsewhere with the others, that will be more

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.510
than the time you spend here..

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.320
We had seen this in an earlier Quotidian.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.389
What’s the lesson that we get from there?

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:25.700
It says, “If you are going to design a remote,
survey what the other remotes look like, and

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.040
design something like that.”

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.529
I saw a remote like this one too.

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:32.639
It was special.

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:33.760
It was interesting.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.339
If you observe carefully, .. you will notice
that there are buttons that say “Too warm”

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:40.459
and “Too cool”.

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:41.930
But, that is confusing too.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.589
Are we to press it if it is too warm?

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:52.070
Or, are we to press “Too Warm” if we need
to make the room too warm??

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.070
Confusion!

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:58.490
There is one more confusion that I will share
with you in the closing thought.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.520
Do you remember this scene?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.520
Flow State?

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.910
Till this day, whenever I encountered “Flow
State”, I was only reminded of the “Wow

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.910
feeling”.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.910
Elevated.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.910
Meditative.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.910
High-performing.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.370
Unmindful of the passage of time.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.839
No idea about what is happening in the environment.

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.530
Without bothering about the suffering the
body is undergoing.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.730
We have read stuff along similar lines, I
am sure.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:33.399
But, just recently, while researching for
this Quotidian, I came to know that the Flow

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:38.699
State, is probably dangerous too.

00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:39.880
Why?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:48.790
Well, this Flow State forces you into a situation
where you don’t call the assistance of mental

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.790
models.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.810
“Hey, I am in a situation..

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.110
Am I right, being in this situation?

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.870
Could I be in a more optimised, better-performing
situation?

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.870
Can I migrate there?”

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.730
You can get answers only if you ask the questions!

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:11.620
A Flow State forces you into a situation where
you don’t even ASK the question!

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:18.639
When you can’t even remember to ask a question,
you can be assured, you will not get the answer.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:27.610
Perhaps this is why, millions of children
around the world, they go through school,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:35.290
and immediately afterwards, they go to a college,
irrespective of what their inner desires are,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.440
what their unfulfilled dreams are.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.410
Just because that is the flow state, that
is the momentum, that is the panic button.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.060
“Everybody is doing it, let us do it too.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.310
Let us not end up missing out”.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:56.820
That single reason has perhaps led millions
to enrol into colleges in courses where they

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:02.430
are not sure whether they will still be passionate
about it four years from now.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.720
Do you see the problem there?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.230
A designer.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.880
Is designing a product.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.980
Has created an interface for it.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.130
How do they do it?

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:19.330
They have a mental model of how that product
should work.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.570
So, they create an interface.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.540
But, why is there a common problem about this?

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.459
Why is it so infamous around the world, this
general belief that user experience is such

00:14:28.459 --> 00:14:29.459
a mess..?

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:34.450
That is because the user is a completely different
person.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.740
Persona, they call it.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.730
They come with their own likes, their own
dislikes, their own value system, their own

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.410
needs, their own dreams, their own vision.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:52.020
They expect something from the product.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.779
They have their own mental model of how it
will work.

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:59.399
So, they receive it.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:02.100
They understand it their way.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:09.810
And, they try using it, that is the “understanding
— implementing” cycle.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:19.300
When you try using it, you end up being unhappy,
dejected, angry, because the mental model

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:25.070
between the designer and the person who is
actually using it, there is friction.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.320
There is no correlation.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:36.320
That is why, the designer of a product, the
person who develops, the person who envisions,

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.390
needs to have loads of empathy.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:45.029
I need to move out of my mind, become the
other person, and try to understand the world

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:47.449
from their point of view.

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:54.230
Very hard, but that is what each of us should
strive for.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.740
As a closing thought, I told you that I will
be highlighting one more problem with the

00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.740
AC.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.190
It is one thing to say that our AC remote
should be designed like other remotes in the

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.190
market.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.839
But, there is another problem.

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:12.910
When I have formed a mental model that AC
remotes will always look and function like

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:18.870
this…, if you go ahead, look at the UP DOWN
problem and design something unique, unusual,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.329
and different, and want to gift it to the
world, expecting it to be the most intuitive,

00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:27.260
expecting it to fit their mental model of
what it should look like, then, the second

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.329
problem would be that it would go against
the mental model I would have formed by then

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:33.019
about how AC remotes work typically!

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:37.560
For, typically, in a home, there would be
2 to 3 AC remotes!

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:43.399
When all the other ACs look like each other,
and this one looks unusual and different,

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:44.829
that is a problem too!

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:50.240
Do you understand the problem?

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:59.470
So, the way this whole thing is setup, ironically,
is, it will bring you down to the lowest level.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.480
You need to elevate the design aesthetic of
EVERYBODY ELSE TOO.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.740
That has been Apple’s problem, by the way!

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.470
It is not enough if Apple devices are intuitive..

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.390
They have to have such an influence in the
world of design..

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.169
That is what they are doing in the Watch.

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:20.230
Until the Apple Watch came along, all watches
were circular!

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:25.579
When Apple brought its square watch, .. “Oh,”
they wondered, “It could be square too!”

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:30.490
And, “Oh, it actually looks more functional
and beautiful too”..

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.970
Circular watches became square.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:41.390
That is the challenge, and that is the mark
of a great designer, with amazing empathy.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.400
Mental model matching!

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.399
We will meet again soon!

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:55.320
In fact, we will meet today, once again!

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.840
Thank you!
