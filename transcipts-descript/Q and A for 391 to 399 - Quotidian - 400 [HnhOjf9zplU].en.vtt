00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.259
Namaste!

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.720
This is the four hundredth episode!

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.770
This is an experiment that we started way
back, on January 1, 2021..

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.390
Every time we cross the “century threshold”,
we have tried to do something different, something

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.390
extra.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.850
Starting from this four hundredth episode,
we thought we could bring a variation to the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.450
Q and A format.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.034
Meet Hamsa Chandrashekar, a friend, a colleague,
a Quotidian partner in crime!

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:50.649
She is going to ask me the questions we have
received over the past few weeks, and I will

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.039
be responding to those questions.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.579
Let’s get started.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.629
Hamsa:- There’s some feedback you have received
for these ten episodes that you’ve done

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:00.960
in the past month.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.949
I am going to be reading out some feedback
pointers.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.740
As I read along, share with us some of the
thoughts you must have had while you shot

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.990
the episode, or even about what you think
regarding this feedback.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.220
Raj:- Sure.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.220
Sure.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.150
Hamsa:- Varadarasan Shanmugavel says, “I
was seeing your face throughout this episode,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.040
but no ‘sign’ of operation.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.820
Either you have fully recovered which might
not be possible, or tolerated the pain; anyway,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.910
we wish you speedy recovery from the knee-joint
problem.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.070
We know you love playing basketball!”

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.620
So, the thing is, this is something that I
have been wanting to ask you personally!

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.140
I know how much you love playing basketball!

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.140
And I know how much of …

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.920
Raj:- In fact, we have played basketball together!

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920
Hamsa:- Yes, we have!

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.030
So, I know it is not easy to shoot an entire
video just after surgery.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.210
So, what kept you going, what motivated you
to get this going consistently without taking

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.210
a break…

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.070
Raj:- We can, of course, spin off a lush variety
of answers to this!

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.970
In hindsight, we can make it sound romantic,
we can make it sound motivational, and all

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.970
that.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.900
But, if we were to speak only the truth, if
I didn’t shoot that video, I thought I wouldn’t

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.670
have the motivation to shoot it any further.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.340
It was like, we had started something, it
was having some kind of momentum, and if it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.560
had to continue at all, no matter what, … I
had to do it!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.670
I had to have to do it!

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.860
I had to create a situation where there was
“no other go”.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.689
Otherwise, probably you may not be able to
see another video!

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:37.439
Only because of that reason, I think, I obsessed
about it so much.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.879
Hamsa:- Awesome.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.010
Raj:- Thank you!

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.470
Hamsa:- The next question is pretty much related
to the previous question.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.790
So, he says, “As we know, we should enjoy
while doing.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.920
In your case, you were not in a situation
to do a video recording.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.390
So, it’s not your mistake.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.999
Then, I don’t know why you got angry with
yourself.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:07.739
If we are not enjoying or even we are not
doing as we wished, then we can give a break

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.079
and we can resume freshly in a better environment
and in a better mindset.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.099
I wish you Godspeed and good health.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.370
Thank you!”

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.290
Raj:- It is the same answer I gave to the
previous question.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.939
Four hundred times..

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.239
Without a single break in between..

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.439
Come rain or shine.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.840
Whether you have other pressing work or not.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.689
Be it a Sunday or a Friday.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.379
If you have been doing something consistently,
… the pain and the regret of the discontinuation

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.879
will be evident only to those who have been
doing it consistently.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.170
It is a crushing feeling.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.170
The fear.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.120
And, that is what kept us going, I would say.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.779
Hamsa:- They say, friction is probably what
slows down acceleration…

00:03:54.779 --> 00:04:00.079
but don’t you think friction is also what
probably increases acceleration and keeps

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.079
that going..

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.529
Raj:- Yes, and friction is also important,
because once in a while, you need to slow

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.060
down, to plan things out…

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.570
I am actually enjoying this Pi-value series
more than the daily-series I did in 2021,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.800
because it gives me more time to think, strategise,
and probably give you a better video!

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.350
Hamsa:- I am going to have to stop you right
there because we have a very relevant question

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.500
coming up later!

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Raj:- Ahaan..

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500
Ahaan!

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.500
Hamsa:- This is from Jeremy D’cruz.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.730
He says, “Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.090
Thank you, Mr. Dandapani, this was a very
special episode, it sort of reminded me of

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.330
my journey to Zoho.”

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.390
So, we are talking about episode 392, Elastic
Time — 2.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.370
Raj:- Well, Jeremy is a colleague of ours.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.610
I just have a little warning note to share.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:58.310
Whenever I hear words like, “This concept
resonated with me, this really drove home

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:06.970
a point, it is like my journey TO Zoho”,
etc… in the corner of my mind there is this

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.220
echo: “Anybody who talks about journey TO
Zoho, in a matter of time, there’s going

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.350
to be a journey FROM Zoho.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.620
On to something else.”

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.230
So, I feel we shouldn’t even be eyeing milestones
like these.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.590
Enjoy the journey.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.880
Don’t obsess about the destination.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.880
Yeah!?

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.470
Hamsa:- It is like you say in one of your
episodes, … the speed of light is the only

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.470
constant.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.840
Raj:- Isn’t that, isn’t that amazing?!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.270
Yes, Yes…

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.250
Hamsa:- The next feedback is, “Amazing sir!

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.870
You rock and a lot of respect for you for
sharing this wonderful episode with us.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.690
Disclaimer: Have some time and patience to
listen to this episode fully, as it depends

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.370
on how much you like this episode which is
directly proporional to the amount of time

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.710
which can seem like 22 seconds or 22 minutes.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.410
PS:- Dosa Kal vs Beautiful girl was amazing!

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.550
Thank you again, sir!

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.260
Raj:- Yes, the quote from Einstein.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.520
Is this feedback from Shine and Glow, by any
chance?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.260
She is one of my regular followers and commenters
in my YouTube channel, and that’s crucial…

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.440
When so many of you are sending me feedback
that it is too lengthy, this is what occurs

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440
to me.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.550
If you can fill it, be it twenty two minutes
or twenty two seconds, if you can fill it

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.070
with meaningful content that kindles your
thought process, and… there is something

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.000
there for everybody to take home and chew
cud and … just sit down and have a “thinking

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.560
session”, if you can achieve that…, then
the time isn’t too relevant.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.590
That’s what I would think.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.770
Hamsa:- Makes perfect sense!

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.690
So, Prithviraj has told us “Law 13 is brilliantly
portrayed in the Tamil movie Sadhuranga Vettai”.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.010
Have you watched the Sadhuranga Vettai movie?

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.440
Raj:- Yes, I have watched that movie.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.010
And, another thought that occurred to me..
when I perused through those 48 Laws.. one

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.010
by one..

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.940
That is probably the beauty of a Law.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.510
How relevant, in how many different environments
and scenarios, how many different viewpoints

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.510
and perspectives…

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:17.330
I didn’t really have the guts to say “Ramayana
will have 24 occurrences..

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.020
Mahabharatha will have 24 occurrences..

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.250
when I got started.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:27.190
But, once I had begun, not just 24, even 48
wasn’t too high a number!

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.330
That is how confident I became.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.780
That is the elegance of a Law, I would think.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.310
So, Sadhuranga Vettai, the Master movie (if
you are a Thalapathi fan!), the Valimai movie

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.220
(if you are a Thala fan!).. surely, in any
of these movies, if you just wear the correct

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.410
lens and spectacles, you will be able to see
a resonance between the Law and the Implementation

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.410
of it.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.280
Hamsa:- So… the next question is about the
Powers of Rama!

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.120
“Rama did not take credit for others’
efforts, it was built for Rama and hence his

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.120
name “Given”.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.370
Raj:- If you delve into this book, many things
he says, they are ways for you to somehow

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.600
thrive in a competitive environment, and not
for you to get yourself a good name by following

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.830
a virtuous unswerving path!

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.150
The book is a strange kind of book.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.240
Someday, we will go back, in Quotidians, to
revisit those Laws of Power.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:26.180
Some colleagues in fact were offended that
I even deigned to bring Rama into this fray!

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.370
Rama is after all “Maryadha Purush”!

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.320
So, I don’t know if we should have even
brought him here!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:41.289
But, get the work done, take credit for it,
… is the Leadership Maxim that this author

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.210
blatantly lays in front of us!

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.250
Please read the book, and we will also revisit.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:52.020
I understand what Rajesh Kanna is saying,
and I also agree, probably that wasn’t a

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.750
stellar example to use Rama in this Law.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.280
Hamsa:- There have been so many kings who
built historical monuments, who fought epic

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.280
wars.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.470
And then there have been so many soldiers..

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.950
And so, it is probably not possible to…

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.550
Raj:- Who built the Taj Mahal?

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.980
Is it Shah Jahan?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.920
Or is it the cement contractor?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.070
Well, he took credit.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.100
He not only took credit, he took the thumbs
of the marble artisans and sculptors too!

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.550
Hamsa:- So, I guess it all comes down to the
leader.. who the leader was, what his vision

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.770
was, and how loyal his followers were!

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:35.180
Moving on to 394, Chitra Ramachandran has
told us, “Amazing, must watch for kids who

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.560
have read Mahabharatha from books”.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.470
This is regarding the Powers of Krishna.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.470
Raj:- The reason I wanted to point this one
out specifically?

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.700
Well, Mahabharatha is not for kids.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.350
There are so many layers to that epic.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:56.510
If you peel the layers, onion-skin fashion,
you will realise that there are many profound

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:04.110
philosophies hidden inside, a hundred shades
of grey between black and white, good and

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:10.990
bad, … Kids may understand it at one level,
but well beyond that, adults have to dig into

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.090
this epic.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.210
That’s my humble request.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.210
You should get into that.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:21.260
Hamsa:- That is also probably because both
Ramayana and Mahabharatha have a lot of contradicting

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.260
principles…

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.260
so…

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Raj:- Mahabharatha more so.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Mahabharatha more so…

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.410
If you were to look at the Ramayana, … and
look for mistakes made by the protagonist,

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.930
almost everybody would point to the killing
of the courageous and powerful Vaali.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.230
But, in the Mahabharatha, where do we even
begin?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.760
Who do we start talking about?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.120
Everybody has done great deeds.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.560
Everybody has done wrongful deeds.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.410
That beauty…

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.310
It is a beautiful tapestry, to weave that…

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.570
it is simply amazing!

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.130
Hamsa:- So, episode 395.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.130
Ammmmazing!

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:56.090
Arul Kumar has told us that “Great example
for this is Kodak.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.930
Like 3M Kodak is a legendary company but they
failed to adopt the new innovation.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:10.360
Now they are just selling their brand name
to other vendors and they are selling their

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.180
TV in Kodak name.”

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.040
Raj:- Many companies…

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.990
they seem to lose their vision only at their
highest point..

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.990
The peak.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:26.670
Even our own CEO, Sridhar Vembu, he often
says “I am not afraid that a Google or a

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:34.130
Microsoft will come and destroy me, I am afraid
of those three/four kids hiding in a garage,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.130
right?

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.290
Dreaming up that next amazing startup…”

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.360
That’s a message for us all!

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.560
You don’t know where it is going to come
from.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560
You can never know.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.490
You can’t prepare for it.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.410
You can only be constantly innovating..

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.640
Constantly “obsoletising” your own stuff.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:59.600
Before your competitor makes your product
obsolete, you make it obsolete yourself!

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.310
Cannibalise it, shelve it..

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.220
So you have room for more ideas..

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.540
That is the way forward.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.630
Hamsa:- Probably, when it comes to the Saas
industry, innovation is the only constant.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.780
Raj:- Correct!

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.440
Hamsa:- Here is one more for 395.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.521
Shine and Glow says:- “Couldn’t ask for
more — Starting from patient money, …” Is

00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:23.170
it patient money or patent money..?

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.170
Raj:- Patient money.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.800
That is, invest and be patient.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.800
Don’t expect results on the double!

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.320
Literally Patient Money!

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.939
That CEO used to say, “Just wait.

00:12:34.939 --> 00:12:39.580
If you are having a gut feel that the idea
is a good idea…Stay put!”

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:45.770
He would protect the idea from all the board
members and investors who would come and ask

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.990
“Show me the action, or stop it!”

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.270
Hamsa:- She closes with “Innovation is when
it touches the lives of someone.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.730
When innovation makes a difference”.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.830
Raj:- That empty idea..

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.030
A thousand people can come up with one..

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.030
It is like…

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.620
Edison had said, hadn’t he?

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.640
Genius is 99 percent perspiration, just 1
percent inspiration.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.810
Anybody can get a good idea.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.130
But to nurture it, grow it, protect it, bring
it to a level in a nursery, deweed the environment,

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:22.290
implement it finally, bring it forth in front
of the customer, and be able to make a visible

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.290
tangible difference…

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:28.779
only when the customer is able to proudly
say, “I am living a better life now, I am

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:31.810
able to do something better now, thanks to
your innovation!”

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.880
Only then, does it become an innovation in
the real sense.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.990
That is a beautiful lesson that 3M can take
full credit for in that book.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.434
Hamsa:- When he knows it had an impact, when
he knows it made a positive contribution..

00:13:43.434 --> 00:13:44.434
Raj:- Yes, Yes..

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:47.210
When it has really changed the way people
live their daily lives.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.930
Hamsa:- Here is one for Episode 396, The Perfect
Team.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.820
So, Suraj Siva asks you, “Please speak lit
bit fast sir…

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.270
Mostly I see half of your video only..

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.730
Because of too lengthy.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.149
Please speak in tamil only..

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:03.830
Half tamil, half English..

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.620
Tamil people ku puriyadhu, English Hindi peoples
ku puriyadhu..”

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:15.000
Actually, I don’t think I understand what
he is trying to say.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.670
Raj:- The point is, we have answered this
question earlier too.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.760
Quotidians will be partially in Tamil, partially
in English.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.330
Why don’t you just accept it as my style?!

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.520
Why don’t you just grin and bear it?

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.500
For speed-management, you anyway have a 0.5x
play mode and a 2x play mode too, helpfully

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.650
provided by YouTube!

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.850
Leave me be, please, for godssake!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.480
:-) Let us move on to the next question!

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.310
Hamsa:- Here is the next one for 396!

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.810
Arunkumar says, “He actually does nothing..

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.910
Just doing the formalities..

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.120
It is the players in the team who did well.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.220
That’s what made them the winners of the
cup”.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.220
Gujarat Titans..

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.800
They are talking about the episode — The
Perfect Team!

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.800
Raj:- I had appreciated Hardik Pandya and
looks like this person didn’t like it.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.020
Well, that’s perhaps yet another hallmark
of great leadership!

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.900
“He has put together such a great team!

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.140
The team members did amazingly well!

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.790
And he just took all the credit!”

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.090
— They would quip, about the leader!

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:21.560
But, only the leader would know “How much
I had to manage all the ongoing politics in

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560
this team…

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.000
How hard I had to work to bring this together..”

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.931
They have said this exact same thing about
Dhoni too.

00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:30.220
About Kapil Dev too.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.209
Any great leader will get this tag.

00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:35.320
And, this tag is something to be proud of,
in fact!

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.499
If somebody questions, “What did you really
achieve as a Leader?”

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:39.899
— Well, that’s the thing!

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:43.069
I needn’t have really achieved anything
as an individual.

00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:47.670
My team will take care of that beautifully,
and that’s the great thing about it.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.050
That’s what Davos adds as a comment.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:54.710
Gathering all the greatest people in your
team is also great work!

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.290
Hamsa:- So, the next one is for 397 and 398.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.020
Again, Arunkumar asks us, “Didn’t we have
only one video scheduled per day?”

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.020
Raj:- Hmm..

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.769
I think here is yet another victim who has
fallen for the Pi-digits sequence conundrum.

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:10.260
Well, in the digits of Pi, occasionally, one
gets a ZERO.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.269
And, if we get a zero, I will have to launch
TWO on that day!

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:15.300
That’s the way it works!

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.880
In a few months, we will be getting two consecutive
zeroes!

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880
What would that mean?!

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.880
Yes!

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.660
On that same day, there are going to be THREE
videos!

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.170
Please be prepared, have some time set apart
for that marathon moment!

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.339
Hamsa:- We have got one more for 397 and 398
combined.

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:35.620
Mohan says, “Killing your darlings is one
of the important but tough processes that

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.800
any designer should undergo, to attain mastery.”

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.350
Raj:- I am sure you will agree!

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.620
You are a creator yourself.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:49.269
You dance, you sing, you draw, in addition
to the other work that you do, at our team

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:50.269
here.

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:58.709
How often have you created something and felt
so connected to it that you don’t want to

00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:03.800
make any further additions, but then, when
you overcome it and make those additions,

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.990
you look back at the first one and say, “Thank
God I moved away from you!”

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.309
Hamsa:- It happens very often..!

00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:12.569
Raj:- It happens very often!

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:13.919
That’s the creator’s First Hump.

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:19.230
Only when you cross that first hump, true
creativity even gets a chance to express itself,

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.230
they say.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.410
Killing your darlings is so important!

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.750
In fact, don’t even call them a darling!

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.829
Because, killing them will become very hard!

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.829
Kill the … whatever!

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:28.829
Yeah?

00:17:28.829 --> 00:17:33.380
(I need to be modest, with this lady next
to me!)

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.820
Hamsa:- Ha.. ha…ha…!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.720
So, Quotidian 399 — Angelina says, “Wow,
amazing, watched the whole video, I understand

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.480
some 25% of Tamil but your translations are
amazing, Rajendran.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.150
The teacher side of you is superb.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.110
Just remembered my own days as faculty.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.270
Beautiful, touching so many topics.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.270
Ultimately, “Don’t do what you can’t
undo”.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.610
“Put people first”..

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.840
my takeaways from the video.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.230
Only thing I didn’t understand is, what
is the intention behind touching so many topics

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.230
in one video!

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.230
​​🤔

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.230
Raj:- Right..

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:09.230
I am guessing..

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.660
Angelina is one of my colleagues in the Professional
Speakers Association of India.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:19.590
And, I am guessing this is one of her first
videos of Quotidian watching, and that’s

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:24.049
why she is getting the feeling that I am touching
a lot of topics.

00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:31.549
The style at Quotidian, the style that I have
come to love, the style that many of our viewers

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:39.320
have come to like, is we take one central
concept, we beat around the bush, we take

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:47.190
mythological connections, we take examples
from school and college and corporate environments,

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:53.970
I give examples from my own life, my upbringing
with my father, with my mother, but they’ll

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.880
always some little red arrow pointing to the
central theme..

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:05.380
Which, by the way, would be conveyed in the
original title, in this case, “Who is responsible!”

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:12.730
We were talking about responsible innovation,
so we touched The Mahabharatha, we touched

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:18.420
corporate politics, we touched The Metaverse,
and we left you with that question, “Are

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.040
we opening another Pandora’s Box!?”

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.040
So, that’ll be the way things will go, Angelina.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.880
Welcome to Quotidians!

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.929
Hamsa:- And with that, I think we have covered
all the feedback we have received for the

00:19:30.929 --> 00:19:31.929
past ten episodes!

00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:32.929
Raj:- Thank you, thank you!

00:19:32.929 --> 00:19:41.230
So, you’ve been associated in the .. behind
the scenes work, at the Quotidians initiative..

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.050
I think for seven months?

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:50.710
So, is there a question that you have been
wanting to ask, but never got around to asking?

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:51.799
We are live!

00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:54.900
Hamsa:- I don’t think I can stop with just
one!

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.710
I think there is one thing all of us would
love to know!

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:04.170
What goes on in your personal behind the scene
work when you prepare for each episode?!

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:12.090
Raj:- Okay, this is what I have found happening
to me, because nowadays I have at least a

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:17.750
couple of days gap between one Quotidian and
another.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.110
It takes a while for me to get the next topic.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:26.700
The moment I get the next topic, I write it
in a todo-list of sorts.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.429
And, I have noticed this happening to me.

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:33.590
Probably that’s what happens to most writers
and creators.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:39.270
From that moment on, the moment I nail that
as the topic, anything that happens in my

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:43.630
life, it could be a movie I am watching on
Netflix, it might be a conversation I am having

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:51.260
with a colleague, it could be a joke I read
somewhere, I seem to want to do a dotted line

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.660
connection with my theme.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.660
Okay..

00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:01.179
I have a grab-bag of sorts, I keep throwing
stuff into it once I have a label on the bag.

00:21:01.179 --> 00:21:08.900
And then, I typically work the previous night
on the deck, and so, when I put the deck together,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:15.310
the presentation for the video, I look at
the grab-bag, I take them out one by one,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.150
I look for visuals, look for text, and…
that’s how.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:27.610
So, if Quotidians are going theme after theme,
week after week, my mindset is also following

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.610
those things.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.470
That’s something I have learned about myself!

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.660
Hamsa:- So, aspiring Youtube Creators?!
