00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.069
What is Design?

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.580
Steve Jobs has made an interesting observation,
a famous quote, about What Design Actually

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.580
Is.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.480
It is not how it looks, it is not how it feels,
it is how it works.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.670
iPod.. 2001..

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.140
An amazing music-playing device.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:29.300
But, in 2006, something sturdier, something
larger in memory capacity, something with

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:38.490
supposedly better software, from a larger
company, popular in many other domains, Microsoft,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.460
they launched a product called Zune.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.790
Why didn’t it become famous?

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.950
Why didn’t you hear about the Zune as often
as you heard about the iPod?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:00.039
There is an answer to this question..

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:10.290
Let us see..!

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
Namaste!

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.189
Four Fifty Four is about lessons from a speed
boat.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.790
If you are wondering what a speed boat can
after all teach us, well, I’m in the same

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.790
boat.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.259
I don’t know, but let’s get started on
the ride!

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.920
Firstly, I want to clarify what is the reason
why the iPod was much more famous and popular

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.500
than the Zune.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.340
I read an article recently, and they have
described the reason.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.719
Very simple, very plain..

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.610
It seems the iPod started appearing in the
hands of some early adopters.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.510
The moment they saw such a device, and realised
that it has been released by Apple, that they

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.290
are able to listen to high quality music,
… some people started buying it, but you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.350
know what happened?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.250
The most important thing that happened was
others saw this shiny device on these people’s

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.879
hands and wanted to borrow it for a few moments
just to have a look around, and they were

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:30.090
able to intuitively, immediately, naturally
understand how to use it without any guidance

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.310
or help.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.720
That single magical thing.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.390
That is the reason why the iPod was so famous,
because the moment he returned the borrowed

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.760
iPod, he made a beeline to the store, to buy
one for himself.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.720
Because it just worked!

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.200
The Zune..

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.900
There were some early adopters and Microsoft
fans who bought it.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.950
I remember one myself and I’m hoping he’s
watching it, but.. he brought it to office

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.129
one day and shoved it into my hand.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.330
“Check this out.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.519
See how beautiful.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.230
See what an amazing new ‘Metro’ user experience
design.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.730
Place it in your ear, and you will be taken
directly to heaven!”. he said.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.260
And, that is how the experience was too!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.660
But.. those intuitive..

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.659
immediate.. glowing of that bulb.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:25.800
I get it..

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.490
I don’t need to ask “Hey, how to go back
in this”..

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.569
That matter?

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.450
That passerby understanding how it works..

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.610
That didn’t happen and hence, there were
fewer people who went to the shop to buy one

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.420
more and hence it wasn’t as famous.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.170
Design is how it works, specifically how some
very important, very few, but very important

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.400
features, how they work.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.860
Some of you may have watched this advertisement.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.863
“Sir, may I present you the super luxury
yacht..

00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:01.863
The Nefertiti.

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:02.863
Apart from all the luxuries, it has six luxury
suites, three kitchens, a mini golf course,

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:22.620
a 3D theater, two ballrooms, and to top it
all, it has a top speed of 25 knots . Kitna

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.120
deti hai??!!”

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.520
So in Hindi, the question asked here is, “All
that is okay, thank you, but…

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.889
How many kilometers to the gallon or how many
kilometers per liter?”

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.500
This man is practical minded.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.060
It is an ad for a Maruti Suzuki car..

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.210
“All that is okay, but please come to the
matter.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.660
The most important matter.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.280
Kitna Deti Hai!”

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.620
I don’t know this man.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:09.490
Probably you may not too, but this man and
his friend there, they were credited on the

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.630
internet for the birth of a very beautiful,
very important phrase.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.810
A question..

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.169
“All that is okay, thank you, but .. does
it float?

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.110
What does it mean?

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:31.580
“Well, you are telling me about a lot of
things, okay, thanks, but this has to float.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.110
That is the most important reason for its
existence.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.110
Does it float?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.250
Even though it sounds like a joke…

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.500
This wasn’t a joke.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:52.949
More than 1000.. 1200 people died when the
Titanic sank.

00:05:52.949 --> 00:06:02.680
The Titanic must have had 64 life boats, but
it made that maiden voyage with just 20 boats.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.850
When you look up the documentation, refer
to history, and look up the logs, two reasons

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.300
were quoted as to why there were only 20 boats.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.060
The deck would look too cluttered with all
those boats in the boat — was cited as one

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.060
reason..

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.831
And, the other reason, if all these boats
were placed around the edge, the periphery

00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:28.770
of the Titanic, but if that is done like that,
the first class passengers looking through

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.229
portholes from their cabins under deck won’t
have an uninterrupted, unobstructed view.

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.039
The edges of boats will be visible.

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.060
It will look ungainly.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.850
So, let us jettison some lifeboats..

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.630
But.. does it float?

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.669
All that is okay, but does it float?!

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.990
Very important question.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:07:01.680
Went unanswered, nay.. even worse.. went unasked,
and that led to this, this debacle of the

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.419
century.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:07.490
A book by this name.. Will it make the boat
go faster?

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.780
An Olympian, An Olympian gold medalist, Britisher..

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.449
A rowboat featuring eight rowers.

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.380
A speed boat.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.310
A row boat.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.699
World Champions at the Sydney Olympics.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:34.539
But, before that grand moment at the Sydney
Olympics.. in ‘98, they get thrashed.

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:37.460
They come eighth in a group of eight.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.800
And, then it happens.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.180
They all get together, they band together
and they decide we need to make a mark and

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.190
we are going to train..

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.210
How did they train?

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.830
And, were there lessons that were even applicable
in today’s corporate world..?

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:00.190
That is what the book talks about.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:05.630
The title of the book, the most important
lesson in the book is “Will It Make The

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.470
Boat Go Faster”.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.789
Ben Hunt Davis is the author and the winner..

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.150
And, you see him kissing the Gold Medal here.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:21.150
If you attend his program, at one crucial
moment, he hands that gold medal over and

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.190
says, “Pass it around in the audience.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.159
This is what I fought for.

00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:29.840
Feel it?

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.800
This is what success feels like.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.029
Get a sense of it”.

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:37.899
What sort of question is this?

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:40.279
Will it make the boat go faster?

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:48.230
Well, he says, “All through the training,
we had only one question burned into our minds.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.810
We kept repeatedly asking that question..

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.100
Again and again.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.790
If ever we got stuck in a dilemma, we asked
that question to ourselves and the answer

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.589
presented itself, the dilemma ran away.

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:01.589
Example?

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:05.670
This training, they are asking us to do it
in this river…

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:11.000
waking up at this unearthly hour in the morning..

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.160
Should I be sleeping now or should I train
in this river?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.600
“Hey, wait, will it make the boat go faster?”..

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.040
“Of course, yes.”

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.490
“Then it’s okay.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.990
I’ll wake up early in the morning.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.830
I’ll come for the training.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.830
Snake bite.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.910
Seems that is what this drink is called.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.760
They go to Thailand for training, and some
waiter accosts them with this unique drink.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760
Snake bite.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.510
“You have never tasted anything like this
before.”

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.120
says he.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.519
They pause and they ask that question, “Will
it make the boat go faster?”

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.740
“Of course not.”

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.300
“Don’t touch it then”.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:10:00.740
A new trainer has come and he wants to measure
the volume of vital capacity that oxygen containing

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.130
ability while you are exercising.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.020
It’s a bit of a pain.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.079
“Who is this new guy who has come?

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.079
Why should I trust him?”

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:15.180
But wait, “Will it make the boat go faster?”

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.350
“Yes.”

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.390
“Let’s do it!”

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.279
Three eggs or four for breakfast?

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:29.029
Will I take four eggs and make the boat go
faster or will I put on weight?

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:36.920
Look at that very simple question that cuts
away the complexity and presents the answer

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.880
to you in an empty plate.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.709
“Here, take it”.

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:46.579
In the world of software engineering, they
even call it Test Driven Development.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:51.820
If you want to build a complex piece of software,
.. well, no problem..

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.190
Just don’t start coding immediately.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.390
Take a very very simple boilerplate piece
of code.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.410
Minimal code..

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.950
It won’t work.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.490
But, write it.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.020
Try it out.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.610
It will spit out an error, surely..

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.610
yes?

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.610
Now, fix that bug.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.079
Now fix the next one.

00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:13.829
Keep doing that, until you get the expected
output.

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:15.220
Test Driven Development.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.250
I remember seeing a cartoon too, about it.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.060
“I am trying to understand TDD.”

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.060
“That’s easy.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.270
First you make a test that fails.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:35.680
Then, you do the least amount of work possible
to make it pass.”

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.820
And, the first person asks again..

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.090
“So, if I’m going to build a bridge..?”

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:49.310
And the wise guy comes back with, “Step
one would be drive your car over a cliff.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.990
Here, take the keys!”

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.160
For, that is the first test!

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.959
A gap between two cliffs.

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.820
You need to go from here to there..

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.250
And, while building it.. while beginning to
build it, .. You need to test before building,

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.250
yes?

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.939
So, drive your car off the cliff first!

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:11.810
Jokes apart, test-driven development is a
methodology where you minimize the amount

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:20.339
of untested out-in-the-blue work that you
do.. you ask yourself a very simple question

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.810
again and again.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.410
“Does it float?”

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.899
“Will it make the boat go faster?”

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:29.600
We have encountered this book earlier..

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.740
Ken Kocienda..

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.740
Creative Selection..

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.440
He is the kingpin who brought the autocorrect
on the Apple smartphones!

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.010
Not just that..

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:47.790
He had another huge contribution to iOS, the
mobile platform from Apple, and that contribution

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.079
was building safari for the mobile..

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:52.650
Safari is the browser application.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:13:00.889
Safari, before it was built for the mobile,
it was first built for the computer.

00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:07.060
And, when that was happening, the world already
had Internet Explorer.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.779
All over the world, there was this Windows
operating system and Windows came pre-installed

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:14.940
with Internet Explorer.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:20.910
Why would anybody want another browser.. was
the thought process at that time.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.269
At that time, Steve Jobs encouraged his employees
with, “We have an Operating System.

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:26.699
We don’t have a browser.

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:32.589
We need to get a browser and it needs to work
blazingly fast.”

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:36.959
That was the question they internalised.

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:41.399
They devised something called the PLT.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:43.639
The page load test.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.839
Remember TDD?

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.040
Test-driven development?

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.889
They created the test.

00:13:49.889 --> 00:13:54.089
It’ll only evaluate one quality..

00:13:54.089 --> 00:13:55.389
Speed of loading..

00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:59.970
Look at their first test result here.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.410
www.yahoo.com is the target.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.970
And, It just loads a black rectangle.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.310
Just load the damn thing, check for the time.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.120
Can we do it faster than other browsers?

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.940
That was the challenge.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.720
The aim was not to load www.yahoo.com.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.389
The aim was to make it faster to load a black
rectangle.

00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:30.139
Then get whatever is in yahoo.com.., no need
to render it.

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:33.579
Just get it and check the loading time..

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:34.579
And then render it.

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:37.769
Don’t bother about organization..

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:44.430
And then that is how they tested it and eventually
when Safari was ready, not only was it an

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:50.540
amazing browser, it was the fastest browser
of its time.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:56.209
Maniacal Focus on one single question.

00:14:56.209 --> 00:15:04.300
Every time they reached a particular point
and it looked so good, but it failed the plt,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:11.019
it was slower than or not faster enough than
the other browsers..??

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:12.730
They failed it.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.870
No need.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.360
They will sacrifice the beauty.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.310
Speed is of the essence.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.139
Single-minded focus.

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:23.339
Does it float?

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.060
Will it make the boat go faster?

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.579
This guy has quite a similar story.

00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:32.560
Vince Lombardi is his name.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.389
The greatest coach of all time, they say,
in American Football.

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:41.680
He has written an autobiographical book called
“The science and art of football”.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:54.910
Before he became a coach for a specific team,
that team had suffered 10 straight knockouts

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.130
from the league.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.089
10 straight knockouts.

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:04.720
The 11th time they lift the champions cup.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.199
Back to basics is what they claim he said.

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:10.589
“We will focus on one thing” he said..

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:13.470
Ring a bell, folks?

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.789
He said, “We will chase perfection.

00:16:17.789 --> 00:16:22.310
Of course we won’t reach it, of course we
won’t be able to touch it, but along the

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:27.369
way we will reach excellence”, he is supposed
to have said.

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:29.750
Chase perfection.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.460
Everything that you do..

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.360
One thing..

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.740
Focus on that alone.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.459
Master it.

00:16:36.459 --> 00:16:39.699
Chase perfection, achieve excellence.

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:45.649
That was his strategy.

00:16:45.649 --> 00:16:53.529
As a closing thought, I wanted to share this
viral video..

00:16:53.529 --> 00:17:00.470
Watch it first..

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:16.670
Somewhere in Erode.. at a Wedding Hall..

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:25.920
“Next Level Marriage Meals”!!

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:34.670
I wondered instead of doing all that, what
if they had invited a gifted chef!

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:40.740
They may have experimented with a multi-cultural,
multi-cusine menu..

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:46.710
They could have donated this money for some
charity..!

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.980
How does it add value?

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.400
We could ask all those old questions again.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.650
Does it float?

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:56.520
Will it make the boat go faster?

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.929
How does it help make a meal memorable?

00:18:01.929 --> 00:18:17.400
In fact, if I look at that golden peacock
standing overbearingly beside me.., I’ll

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.040
be psyched out.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.850
I wouldn’t want to eat.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.470
I am reminded of that movie called UP.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.809
This is what comes to mind.

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:34.910
That little scout-boy munching chocolate,
and when he is not looking, this happens.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.740
I’d be wondering if this bird is going to
peck at my food or perhaps even peck on my

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.380
head.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.180
Anyway, thank you.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.250
Hope you make your boat go faster.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.840
We will meet soon!

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:58.970
Thank you.
