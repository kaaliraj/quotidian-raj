00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.600
In Google Translate, I typed the word “Follower”.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.929
And it gave me two different answers.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.200
In Tamil.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.790
It said, “Pinpatrubhavargal”, “Pinthodarbhavargal”.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.880
Do you see the difference?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.800
One is, you catch the back and get dragged
along…

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.670
The other is, you see somebody going ahead
of you, you like what they are doing, and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.440
you consciously go behind them.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:01:01.620
“Pinthodarvadhu” is better, I guess.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:11.751
Around ten days ago, we watched a video where
I saw somebody called Sumitra Palanisamy tell

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:16.450
us about leading versus being a boss.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.420
Sumitra asked me, “I am still searching
for a leader.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.410
I have seen many bosses.. but how do I find
a leader?”

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.390
I want to turn that question back at her.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.760
I want to ask her — Have you been a good
follower?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.780
You keep asking for a leader…

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.910
Have you been a good follower?

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.490
I think it was Vivekananda...

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.690
Swami Vivekananda… who said: He who wants
to lead, or command, must know how to obey.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.510
I think we should do a Quotidian exclusively
on this matter.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:08.310
What are the qualities that represent that
ideal second-in-command?

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.629
That ideal person who serves a leader.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.090
That idea follower.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.560
Let’s see.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.280
More than a year ago, in Quotidian 078, I
talked about a book.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.090
A special book, I said.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.260
The Adventures of Johnny Bunko.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.060
And I told you, please DON’T READ IT!

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.720
My assumption, and I think it is correct,
you must have SURELY READ IT!

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.620
For, only when you say such stuff, the curiosity
is piqued!

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.620
Agree?

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.370
I am sure you have read the book.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.280
I am going to point to one particular incident
in the book where Bunko gets an amazing idea.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.639
And Bunko works for somebody called Lakshmi.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.920
And instead of going and reporting it, that
amazing idea, to Lakshmi, he says, “No,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.129
No, No, She’ll just slow us down.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.569
This is so awesome, I’m going directly to
the CEO”…

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.549
Saying thus, he heads over directly to Lakshmi’s
boss.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.939
At this point, the author teaches us two really
beautiful lessons.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.049
He goes over to Lakshmi’s boss.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.730
And says, “Hello boss, my name is Johnny
Bunko.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.840
I’m with the Special Projects Team of Lakshmi’s.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.950
We are researching on ideas for new shoes.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.400
I’ve got some seriously amazing idea, I
want to propose that to you directly”.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.519
Look at how beautiful the lesson is, here.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.590
Daniel Pink blesses us with this:- The boss
— look at his instant reaction.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.849
Look at the first two questions that that
boss asks Johnny Bunko.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.469
Question Number 1:- Does Lakshmi know you’re
here?

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.389
Question Number 2:- Who are you?

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.519
What was your name again?

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.689
I don’t even know you!

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.940
Is this the right behaviour?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.940
Should the CEO have done something else?

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.940
What else happens in this story..?

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.759
All that is a story for another day.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.669
But, what am I trying to underline here?

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.730
I am trying to say, there is protocol.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.780
Bypassing your immediate boss to get the spotlight
on yourself is probably not the right thing

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.030
to do.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.150
This happened just ten days ago, in my classroom.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.190
At the Zoho School of Business, we were having
an open discussion.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:05:01.810
One student, Aryan by name, was telling us
an idea that another student, called Mehnaaz,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.400
had stolen from him and supposedly posed as
her own!

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.210
What should we do?

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.330
Should we remain silent?

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.680
Should we confront Mehnaaz?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:20.780
Should we poison Mehnaaz with further toxic
wrong ideas so that she gets a bad name?

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.560
Should I publicly tell all my teammates about
it?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.780
Should I go tell the boss?

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.409
Were some of the various scenarios we discussed
in class.

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:37.629
Each scenario, we shot down, we discussed
why it was wrong, probably that’s a Quotidian

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.770
for another day.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:47.240
But, while we were debating about it, we dwelt
on whether it was a good idea to go to the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.150
boss and say, “That was actually my idea.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.849
it was stolen by Mehnaaz”…

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.870
Was that going to be useful?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.870
Beneficial?

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.370
This was the final analysis we reached, on
that topic.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:09.570
Going and telling the boss that Mehnaaz stole
my idea might actually irritate the boss.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:18.389
Might actually make the boss wonder, “Hey,
if you are going to be upset when ideas are

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.319
stolen from you, you are going to be upset
with ME!

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:34.289
Because, every boss or leader, by default,
steals ideas from those under them.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.440
Do they decorate it even further after stealing
those ideas?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.139
Do they copy it verbatim and claim it as their
own?

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:49.660
Do they brainstorm on it further and embellish
it while giving you due credit?

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:58.100
Those are the points of difference, but this
is the way work gets done in an environment

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.870
at work.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:08.159
Basically, you will be given work, the output
will be taken upwards, to the big bosses,

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.530
and it will usually be the senior manager
who will project it as the work that he has

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.939
done with the help of his team.

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:21.469
So, if you are going to get angry because
a colleague copied from you, then, “Hey,

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:25.639
I am going to do that same to you next!

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.490
How are you going to work with it?

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.750
You seem to be sensitive!”

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.370
That is another problem that will come up
soon.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:39.030
This book, we have seen earlier too — Enchantment
by Guy Kawasaki.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:44.130
In this Enchantment book, how to enchant your
customers, how to enchant your visitors, how

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.300
to enchant your employees, and it goes on
and on..

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.610
One chapter stands out: How to enchant your
boss!

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.810
He gives four beautiful lessons — How to
enchant your boss.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.669
Some of them we have seen already.

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:03.360
Anyway, I will go through each of them quickly.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.409
Lesson Number One — he says, You have to
make her look good.

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:14.850
Your boss, your manager, they should feel
that they are being positioned better because

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.120
they have you in their team.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.550
They have you in their team, and they are
getting a good name because of that!

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.569
You are making them feel better, work better,
shine better, look better.

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:34.060
Then, if you make your boss look good, your
boss will make you look good.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.430
Don’t mistake this as politics.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.409
Guy Kawasaki reminds us too.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.479
Don’t take me wrong.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.060
This is the way work gets done!

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.459
You have to make your boss look good.

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:52.670
Lesson Number Two — a little controversial
again — he says, Drop everything else you

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.050
are doing and do what your boss says.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.209
Don’t second guess them.

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:03.200
If you approach it logically, the boss knows
you are working on something.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:12.120
And, if you are finished doing it, they know
that you will go to them and do the next thing,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.420
ask for the next thing.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.779
When that is the situation, then, if your
boss comes to you with work, they know that

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:20.250
you are busy with something.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.480
They are coming to you because they have something
more important that they want you to work

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.480
on.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.410
Don’t go about asking if this is really
important, whether it needs to get done immediately,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.410
etc.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:36.580
Just drop everything else you are doing, and
start doing it.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:42.870
The Third Tip or Advice he gives is, You have
to underpromise and overdeliver.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.310
We have seen this earlier too.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:54.529
If you are 120 percent sure that you will
get something done in 80 percent of the time

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:57.639
that you are promising, then that is a good
thumbrule, he says.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:05.430
If it will take about five days, say that
it will take about seven days, and earn their

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.200
respect and trust first.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.310
Again, is he asking us to LIE?

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.310
NO!

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.829
Unknown, unexpected troubles are going to
come.

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:18.390
Instead of foisting those unexpected troubles
on to your boss just like that, take that

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.390
buffer yourself.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.390
You be the buffer.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:25.430
You add that adjustment and ensure you deliver
on or before time.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:32.529
And, finally, this is one more that we have
seen earlier too, he says, Expose your work.

00:10:32.529 --> 00:10:39.350
What is your work, what is its prototype,
what are its smaller versions, be transparent

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.350
about all this.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.560
Like your work is encased in glass.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.860
Make it immediately evident about the current
state of the work.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:51.940
So, that he can give, she can give, early
feedback and guide you along the way.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.910
That is when they will not start doing it
in parallel.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.820
After giving you a job, wondering how it is
going to come, and when, if you don’t want

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:06.570
them to go right ahead and do a Plan B Backup
work by themselves, you need to do these four

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.360
things.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:18.300
See, if you enter the world of chess, every
employee, they can’t be blamed for looking

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.880
at themselves as a pawn.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.180
You are sending me to the battlefield.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.529
And, you are banning me from retreating ever
in this battlefield.

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:30.390
You are forcing me to only move forward..

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.870
I don’t want to fight.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.720
Every one of them is more powerful than me.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.529
If the pawn starts thinking along these lines…?

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:44.480
Or, if it starts thinking, “You want me
to move to that location, but I don’t want

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.300
to!”, will it be practical?

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.760
Most of the time a pawn movement is for material
loss.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.940
That is, most chess players, when making a
pawn move, think, “If I sacrifice this pawn,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:05.120
I will get a positional advantage, I will
get a strategic advantage.”

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.449
They don’t make a pawn move to attack or
capture something.

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:10.710
Typically they make it to sacrifice the pawn.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.420
That pawn is probably not wise enough.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:19.180
“Look at me, poor me,” it might say, “I
am being moved ahead like the sacrificial

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.640
goat”.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.450
But, point of view matters.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:31.300
If only the pawn had the big picture view
of the chess player, the tall view of the

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.370
king, or the queen, remember, the pawn is
the smallest or shortest piece on the chessboard.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.490
The viewpoint itself is different.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:46.410
If the pawn had the big picture view, it will
probably understand “I am part of a larger

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.170
community”.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.220
It is like a beehive or an anthill.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.860
One ant doesn’t matter.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:59.370
If each ant starts thinking for itself, there’s
going to be trouble.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.680
It has to work like a single organism.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.300
Why do they call it ‘organisation’?

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.300
It is a single unit.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.190
A single entity.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:13.019
And, finally, there is that beautiful reward.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.800
A reward directly from God!

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:23.300
If the pawn advances, if it follows the rules,
if it progresses, of course the pawn gets

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.300
to be promoted.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.300
To queen!

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.130
The most powerful piece on the chessboard!

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.190
Is it not!

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.519
Talking about that book, I want to add a closing
thought here.

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:42.230
If you take a look at the table of contents
of that book, the eleventh chapter is “How

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.550
to enchant your boss”.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.790
Chapter 11!

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:56.170
In the US Law, in business law, Chapter 11
is all about insolvency, bankruptcy!

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:02.160
So, there is this thing, the morality, the
ethics.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.910
You can’t be bankrupt about that.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.930
You can’t get away with “My boss told
me, so I dropped everything else and started

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.190
doing what he told me to”.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.970
I would then bring to your mind one more Quotidian
we did pretty recently.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.980
Quotidian 373.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.300
I hope you remember.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.000
That knife to the chest.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.330
There are ethics.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.360
There are morals.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:28.940
Only beyond all that comes the tenet of following
what your boss asks you to!

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.590
Keep that in mind, and be a good follower.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.550
We will see you later.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.850
Two days from now, that is!

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:38.250
Thank you!
