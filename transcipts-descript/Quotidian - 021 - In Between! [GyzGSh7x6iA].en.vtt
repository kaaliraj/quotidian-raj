00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
Namaste!

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.910
There is this trick question that we get asked
once in a while.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.750
What is the length of the Indian coastline..

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:17.130
If you observe the map, well, from the point
of view of a spacecraft flying around earth,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.780
it might be measured as, perhaps, 7500 kilometres.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.060
But, .. is that the answer?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.500
Or, if we fly at the height of an airplane
in the sky, we might be able to observe the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.059
curvature and bay of Chennai, wouldn’t it
be different?

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:36.370
If we observe from the height of bird-flight,
we might even be able to see the MGR Memorial

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.370
in Marina Beach..

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.910
What would be the length of the coastline
then?!

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.860
What if a man were walking along the coast,
and tried to measure the coastline?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.490
There would be little mounds, twists, turns,
inlets, promontories, etc..

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.490
Then?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.910
What if we walked along, assuming the size
of a puny ant?!

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.960
Every little mound would be like Mount Everest,
for it!

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.960
Then!?

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.110
Even a little rivulet of dirty water would
seem like The Ganges River, The Kaveri River,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.110
to it.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.110
Then?!

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.610
Well, the mystery in this matter is pretty
interesting.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.290
If you measure the coastline with a 100 km
rod, it would come to about 7500 km.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.850
If you reduce the length of the rod, it might
measure up to 45000 km.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.420
It depends on the length of the rod.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.220
If you keep reducing the length of the rod,
the length of your measurement will keep on

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.220
increasing!

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.220
Will it keep increasing?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.650
Is there no converging limit to it?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.650
Yes!

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.450
There is no limit!

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.350
That is the wonder here!

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.909
It is a physics concept.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.780
A mathematical concept too.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.130
In fact, near Alaska, there is a place like
this.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.620
Just 600 miles long, as the crow flies.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.000
But, because of the crevices, nooks, crannies,
fjords, bays, backwaters, it actually measures

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.490
up to 16000 miles if one walks along the water’s
edge!

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.200
In physics, this is called “Fractals”.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.440
Fractional dimensions.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.300
This is a simple formula:- Z(n+1)=Z(n)**2
+ c

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:17.359
It is the 
visual representation of this simple-looking

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.359
formula.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:26.950
But, if you keep zooming, complexity seems
infinite, unending, recursive, deepening.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.349
Look at the picture.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.730
As we go back and forth, zooming in and zooming
out, you also notice self-similarity..

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.510
Whatever we saw in the zoomed out view is
seen once again, as miniatures in the zoomed-in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.510
view too!

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.800
A “point” is zero-dimensional.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800
A “straight-line” is one-dimensional.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.349
A “flat plane” is two-dimensional.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.349
This one?

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.349
Is fractional-dimensional!

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.099
Fractals, they are called!

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.989
Enjoy the beauty of it!

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.540
Infinite complexity and self-similarity across
dimensions!

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.560
Born of a simple formula like that.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.390
Benoit Mandelbrot — the scientist from IBM
who was working on that formula, tried to

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.900
visualise how it would look, on a computer,
and discovered this.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.939
Mandelbrot set, this is called.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.920
Forms the foundation for much of Chaos Theory.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.059
But the reason I brought it up for you today,
is something else.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.200
Those gaps… those overlaps.. the space in-between?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.189
Is not simple.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.659
That is where interesting concepts lay hidden.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.849
That is where complexity awaits the adventurer.

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.709
If you consider the world of business itself,
it is a fractal landscape.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.459
If you get an amazing idea, well, you learn
soon that seven other people have already

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.939
come up with it elsewhere, we shouldn’t
stop!

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:13.939
An idea here..

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:14.939
An idea there..

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.340
The gap between these two ideas?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.150
There will be interesting opportunities awaiting
you there.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.430
That should be your quest!

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.120
Quest for something interesting!

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.810
So, for example, it might look like a Feature.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.060
But, dig deeper, dwell on it further, you
will be able to see that it is probably a

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.060
module.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.060
Probably a product.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.240
Probably it is a whole domain by itself.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.250
So, in financial processing, for example,
credit-card processing is a domain.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.470
In credit-card processing, fraud identification
is a domain.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.720
Using machine-learning to identify fraud is
a domain.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.010
If you keep drilling deeper, you will notice
a whole universe of complexity waiting!

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.380
Take this, for example.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.380
A notebook.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.320
There are drawbacks, when you consider a notebook.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.100
There are advantages too.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.100
You can write.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.100
No power needed.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.640
But, you will run out of pages.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.480
And, you can’t digitise these notes, after
having penned them down.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.970
On the other side, you have an iPad.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.540
A tablet.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.860
You can draw digitally.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.630
But, you need to charge it.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.430
You need a special pencil stylus to write
on it.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.920
That is the other end of the spectrum.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.800
One guy came along.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.440
And, introduced the Rocketbook Wave.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440
What is it?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:48.080
Well, it is a conventional notebook, just
like that, no power needed, you can use a

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.040
common pen, you can write on it, holds about
four hundred pages,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.260
And then you can use the App that comes along
with it, snap snap snap, and you get all your

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.110
notes recorded on to the cloud.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.250
And, if you ever run out of space in your
notebook, all you need to do is microwave

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.250
it!

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.841
Heat it for a couple of minutes, and the notebook
is clean and ready for more!

00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:15.880
For you to draw again!

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.500
So, the world of notebooks and the world of
tablets, an interesting remix of these two

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.640
worlds, that is the in-between gap, interesting
concept that I want you to explore!

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.380
All the best!
