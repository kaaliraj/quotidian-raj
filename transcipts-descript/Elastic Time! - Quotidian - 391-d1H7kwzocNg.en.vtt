00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:10.660
Everything was going quite fine…365 days…364 videos...and then we jumped based on

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:19.270
the digits in the expansion of Pi...that many
days we jumped.. What happened? After the

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:29.619
28th of April, we should've had one on the
1st of May. Why wasn't one launched? Why

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.400
didn't you ask about it? A short video about
it, today!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:02.100
Namaste! Three Hundred and Ninety One! I was
telling you about the calendar and the date

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.120
we missed...well, this is what happened. On the
3rd, 7th, and the 13th of April, we launched the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.760
episode as per schedule. On the
15th, I had an operation performed on my knee.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.159
They call it ACL reconstruction. A ligament
was diagnosed as completely torn, and it needed

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.220
immediate intervention and I went in for a
surgery. We launched 15th, because I had pre-created

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.350
it; and then, you might have noticed, 21 and
25, I was actually standing with a walker.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.750
Some people commented that I wasn't moving
around much in those two videos. My posture

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.900
was slightly skewed. Good catch! Yes, I struggled,
but I somehow still made those deadlines.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.130
And then, we had 28. By which time, a
complication had started up in my knee and

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.729
I had to get myself readmitted and that's
why I did that from the hospital using a memoji..

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:13.950
I was wearing a hospital gown and I wasn't
shaven,...so, we tried this trick. But,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.919
on the 30th, I went in for a second surgery,
they had to intervene and do some observations,

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:30.650
so, I was bedridden on the 30th. The thing
was, on 28th, I told myself, three days, three

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.449
days, third day from now, third day,&nbsp;…
I have an appointment, I have a Quotidian

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:43.239
coming up, and somewhere along the way, three
days, three days, third day from now, became,

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:55.879
yes, you guessed it, May 3rd; and... I missed
it. A year and five months of very regular,

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:05.389
proper discipline, just vanished, just like
that, poof!

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:13.069
I have heard of these circadian rhythms. They
are supposed to be your biology actually having

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:21.719
an internal clock...that is the reason for
example, why flowers open their buds just

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:31.249
in time when the sun rises…it is also why
bats sleep, and when it is night time, they

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:40.930
wake up without an alarm call. That is also
why, these days, many IT workers suffer because

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.059
of depression, because of PCOD, and so many
different complications...because they haven't

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:55.550
given respect to their circadian rhythm. Their
body clock not in sync with the clock of the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:04.119
outside world. That's exactly what happened
to me. I was in that hospital bed...and there

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:13.079
was a small window to the side which I couldn't
walk to, there were no traffic sounds anyway,

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:20.120
sunlight and moonlight were both the same
because the shutters were drawn. Nothing

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.979
changed, every couple of hours a nurse came,
a nurse went, and I think that also contributed

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:35.659
to my missing of the calendar. The circadian
rhythm went kaput.

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:44.590
I, I was angry, I was upset, I even called
up my friends and I asked them… Hey, one

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.379
of you could have reminded me.. They commiserated
with me.. But, beyond that, they couldn't

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.580
say anything more, they didn't have anything
more to say! I mean, this is something that

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:07.330
I am doing. They are encouraging me along,
I could not complain beyond what I did that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.410
day.
Another complication! A friend had put together

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.490
a Quotidian Calendar for 2022! A high-resolution
image, beautifully laying out what has been

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.250
completed, what's pending, what's coming up
next, etc! Only last week did I realise, there

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:34.289
was a big bug in the calendar too! Take a
look at this! Every month has 31 days! February

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:46.370
too! April too!! So, yes, I missed the day,
but there have been some circumstances which

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:55.080
led me to what happened. Forgive me. I will
ensure this doesn't happen again.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:03.939
My brother-in-law...he actually had one message
for me...when I said...I missed, I am devastated..

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:10.729
I am feeling so bad...I am filled with negative
energy now...when I was cribbing about it,

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:20.599
he had just one word...Kannaa! Prioritise!
Yes...correct advise perhaps. I am at the

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:26.990
hospital. A second surgery is looming, there has been a complication. To talk about "Quotidian" now...

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:35.930
won't it get us all riled up, said my family
members too! But, what happened afterwards?

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:47.099
It has been eight days since I missed that
day. You know what? I once again lost the

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:55.419
motivation temporarily. Does it really matter
at all? Why don't I just give up…? That

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.409
was when I was reminded of a famous quote
from Clayton Christensen, (we have encountered

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.870
this person earlier too), which went:- It
is easier to hold your principles 100% of

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:13.319
the time.. I won't change at all. I will do
it every day. I will do it consistently...

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:24.300
is easier…than doing it 98% of the time.
I will skip it just on the day of the surgery…

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.469
I won't do it only on days it rains…it
is so much harder to maintain a cadence like

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:36.780
that. And I experienced it first-hand. So,
guys, if you are trying something, if you

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.449
are putting a habit in place, perhaps swearing
not to eat non-vegetarian food, perhaps to

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:50.939
go on a run everyday, perhaps never to ever
speak a lie,…whatever interesting, useful

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:58.620
habit you are trying to inculcate…very
important piece of advice - don't go for that

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:11.129
98%. Go for 100% It is very very hard to claw
back after you fall.

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:20.559
That is when I encountered this book. When
time was bending, flexing, slipping, when

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:26.550
my clock and the world's clock were doing
a crazy unsynchronised dance, that is when

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:33.539
I encountered this book by Benjamin Hardy.
He is a famous YouTuber, famous author, motivational

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:45.180
speaker; I have read a few other books by
him. This man hit me with this book. Slipstream

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:54.730
Time Hacking is the name. How to create time,
live more, enhance happiness. Almost sounds

00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:04.600
like snake oil. A panacea for all diseases!
In fact, when I read the introduction to the

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:13.220
book, it talked about Dr. Albert Einstein,
it talked about science fiction, it talked

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:21.550
about movies, it talked about God! It talked
about four completely different subjects…

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:29.380
but, I was at the hospital, and I was able
to complete reading the book. And I am really

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.930
thankful that I had this opportunity to read
this book. I learned quite a few interesting

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:43.329
things, and the next Quotidian, due tomorrow,
I am going to dedicate to this book and the

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:52.080
learnings I have from it. Let us meet tomorrow!
Let us surely meet tomorrow! But, before that,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:10:00.190
we need a closing thought, don't we?
My closing thought is just this. If you are

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:12.620
a creator, remember that creativity is essentially
a very lonely art. Something done all by yourself.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:21.910
Don't expect support. Don't expect encouragement.
Don't expect reminders. Don't expect contributions.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:29.830
It is a lonely struggle, he says. It is, in
reality, the ability to reach inside yourself

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.200
and drag forth from your very soul, an idea..
says this famous artist - Lou Dorfsman.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:44.850
I completely agree. Because, you see, I have
a YouTube channel, most of us are connected

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:55.009
via Whatsapp, but not a single one of you
wondered when the next episode was...nine

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:59.680
days have gone by…it has never been delayed
by such a long period…even if you didn't

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.389
know we were bouncing along like Pi, did even
one of you raise the fundamental question?

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:13.779
None of you did...this makes me a little sad…anyway,
tomorrow is a fresh day! Let us meet! Thanks!
