00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:08.968
Yesterday, I was making references to the “Mudhal Mariyaadhai” movie

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:14.014
and had quipped that I had a bit more to share about it in the forthcoming episodes

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.187
Many of you wondered — what more there could be. So, here goes

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:25.151
Let me slake your curiosity right away!
Why don’t we watch a short clip from the movie itself?!

00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:37.037
&lt;Movie clip&gt;

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.040
Observe his behaviour carefully.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.007
&lt;Movie clip&gt;

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:53.012
Before giving it a try, he looks around furtively.. He wants to ensure that nobody is watching

00:00:53.012 --> 00:01:07.985
&lt;Movie clip&gt;

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:11.947
He fails the first time, but it doesn’t count, does it? Because? Nobody noticed!

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:20.456
And, as nobody noticed the first failure, if and when he succeeds, he can claim that he succeeded at the first attempt! :-)

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.583
Look at this story now

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:31.550
A lawyer is accusing a “poor old lady” of some crime.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:43.520
The lady pleads — It makes no difference what I say. You already seem to have decided I am guilty

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.483
The lawyer uses even that statement from the lady against her, by turning it around!

00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:52.488
See? See? He bellows! The “witch” seems to know what I am about to say!

00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:55.032
And, thus, this woman is not an ordinary innocent woman, she is a witch! (And hence deserves to be burned at the stake!)

00:01:55.032 --> 00:02:03.040
 In other words, he is committing the logical folly of “Concluding based on an argument that only takes into account facts that are favourable to his case”.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.718
We saw two stories. Here, let us see a third one

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:13.663
There is this thing that used to do the rounds on the internet — a table that linked Lincoln’s and Kennedy’s assassinations. 

00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:17.846
There are many more such factoids — you can pause the screen and read through them — or you can even go on google to find out more about it.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.809
Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846, while Kennedy’s happened in 1946.

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.687
One becomes President in 1860, while the other in 1960

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:32.152
Lincoln had an assistant by name “Kennedy”, and Kennedy, unbelievably, had an assistant named “Lincoln”

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.696
Both of them were assassinated with a shot in the back of the head, in the presence of their wife!

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.157
Both died on a Friday!

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:42.496
Both of them were killed by assassins whose
names had three parts (first name, middle name, last name) and not the usual two (first name, last name)!

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:46.458
Count the letters in the name and you hit
15 in both!! And so on and on!

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:50.337
Amazing coincidences, they called it!

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.883
But, if you really give it scientific scrutiny, and dig a bit deeper, you notice discrepancies!

00:02:54.883 --> 00:03:01.683
Lincoln was killed by a pistol shot, while Kennedy’s took a long range rifle.

00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:05.569
 Lincoln was a Baptist, while Kennedy was a Catholic.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.354
Lincoln died in Washington, while Kennedy was shot at in Texas

00:03:09.354 --> 00:03:13.420
Lincoln was coming out of a theatre, Kennedy was in a motorcade.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.153
And, Lincoln is as famous for his beard as Kennedy is for his clean-shaven look!

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.273
And, the list goes on!

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:29.191
So, again, if you take only what suits you, only what seems to support your spurious logic, you can go out there and prove that anything is true!

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.328
They’ve got a NAME for this sort of thing. They call it the Texas SharpShooter Fallacy.

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:39.989
Where does this name come from? There was a guy in Texas, who liked shooting

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.624
(No, he wasn’t all that good at it!)

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:50.225
He goes to his barnyard, shoots some random holes in the fence

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:56.119
and THEN, he goes over

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:04.856
draws concentric circles and bulls-eyes around the bullet-holes that had already been created on the fence.

00:04:04.856 --> 00:04:09.750
Aha! Now, passers-by give this guy a wide-berth because they think he is a sharpshooter,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.717
Now, passers-by give this guy a wide-berth
because they think he is a sharpshooter, and means business!

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.731
Ignoring the differences..Overemphasising the similarities.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.734
Consider Covid-data.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:41.772
If I were to fit a curve to the data using a regression algorithm

00:04:41.772 --> 00:04:44.767
I may get a linear graph.

00:04:44.767 --> 00:05:09.577
What would the ruling party do? They look at the same data, but do a logarithmic curve and claim that numbers are tapering off.

00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:20.907
What does the opposition party do? They choose the points that suit their claim that the covid case numbers are growing uncontrollably, and lament that the curve is one of exponential growth!

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:25.955
What is the point I am trying to get across?

00:05:25.955 --> 00:05:27.834
 There is just one little lesson.

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:31.228
Data science, today, is such a burgeoning field.

00:05:31.228 --> 00:05:34.465
Everybody wants to get data-wise. 

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:39.297
There is this matter of ethics deeply entwined with this. One of morals.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:45.383
It is very easy to cheat — it is very easy to be cheated. 

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:48.691
Statistics, historically, has always been such a domain.

00:05:48.691 --> 00:06:02.654
There is even a famous book to parody that thought. “Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics” is the title of the book!

00:06:03.556 --> 00:06:07.379
Beware!

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.120
Until tomorrow then!
