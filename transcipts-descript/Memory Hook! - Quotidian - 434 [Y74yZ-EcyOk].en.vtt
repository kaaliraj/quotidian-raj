00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:07.870
Success Formula.. The Secret of Success..
If you search for these phrases, you’ll

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:15.230
get a lot of results online. The images are
of poor quality… intentionally! Books are

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:25.210
the same too. They will talk as if all you
need to do to succeed is read these books!

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.099
By the way, while researching this, I even
encountered a “Success Formula” too!

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.070
Success is equal to… Purpose multiplied
by Passion, Failure subtracted from it, the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.059
Square Root of Grace multiplied by Grit added
to it (ouch! this is hard for the math-haters!),

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.289
multiplied by Innovation, from which we need
to subtract the square of the sum of Negativity

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:56.079
and Comparison, and finally add the Cube of
Community (I love this part! Sharing is Caring!)

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:05.940
multiplied by Inspiration! This is the formula
for Success, it claimed! Formula.. FOR Success…!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:14.520
The Secret Formula FOR Success.. But, you
know what.. There are cases where Success

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:41.549
IS the Formula! What is Success the Formula
for? Let’s see!

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:55.750
Namaste! Four Hundred and Thirty Four is about
Memory.. and Memorability.. How do we hook

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.910
you and pull you and catch you and make the
message STICK to you?!

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:12.870
Making it stick. Made to Stick. Chip and Dan
Heath are the authors. In this book, they

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:22.480
give six important things to keep in mind
if you want to ensure your message is kept

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:31.090
in mind. You may be a Writer. You may be a
Speaker. You may be a Teacher. You may even

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.730
be a Partner. If you want to say something
or write something or convey something, and

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:47.500
you want it to stick, probably this is something
you will have to keep in mind. They even give

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.410
it as a simple and easy-to-remember formula
— Success, that word, one formula for each

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.420
letter in that word.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.030
The first one is S for Simple. It is quite
obvious, after just one look. That bulb isn’t

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.480
burning. This one is! Make it Simple. Make
it Straightforward. These are all famous sayings

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:23.590
that have stood the test of time. Short and
Sweet, as they say. It could be “Think Different”

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:33.770
from Apple, “Be the Change” from Mahatma
Gandhiji, “Aaruvadhu Chinam” or “Nyayampada

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:41.379
Urai” from the Aathicchoodi. “Jaisee Karnee
Vaisee Bharnee” and “Jahaan chaah Vahaan

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:49.420
Raah”.. There is even a rhythm and a rhyme
to it. Memorability goes up when you give

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.489
up all the other stuff and get to the core..
“Kadukai Thulaitthu Ezhu Kadalai Pugutthi”

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.769
they said, about the Thirukkural. It is the
CORE of the message. Everything else is chopped

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.640
off. Only what remains. Only the essence.
That is very important when you are trying

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.540
to convey a message. S for Simple. U?!

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.894
U is for the Unexpected. Just when you are
least expecting, it comes bang in front of

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:30.080
you, and slaps you on your cheek. “And they
lived happily ever after, for eleven days!”..

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.400
See? You didn’t expect it, did you? The
exact same thing happened when Bill Gates

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.449
was delivering a TED Talk. Nobody expected
it, when he was talking about malaria.. He

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.700
was saying, “More money is being pumped
into research for baldness (hey, I am not

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:57.910
bald, I shave my hair!) than money spent for
malaria! You look for money to spend on malaria

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:06.240
research, but it has all been eaten by baldness
research efforts! And, this is what he did,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.419
on the TED stage. “Malaria is transmitted
by mosquitoes. And I brought some here so

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:21.910
you could experience this.. I will let those
roam around the auditorium a little bit…

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.990
there…! Why should only the poor people
have that experience?!” 2009 it was, when

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:42.470
he did this. It is still memorable. I share
it. No better example than this, for the use

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.169
of Physical Props during presentations. Thankfully,
they were not the infection-prone mosquitoes.

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:56.460
We won’t get malaria from their bite. But…
that’s what he did! Unexpected! Our mind?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:06.580
It is a SUCKER for the unexpected. Novel.
Unusual. Never seen before. Unexpected. The

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:14.620
mind immediately starts begging — give me
more, give me more! U for Unexpected. S. U.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.030
C. What is C for?

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:26.800
C.. one C.. is for Concrete! There is a website
called the Fischbowl.. By a person named Fisch.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.740
Karl Fisch. It was way back in 2004, 2005,
when he talked about how education should

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.940
be, how it is done wrongly at that time, … and
the irony is it is still relevant, to this

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.330
day. A famous video from this website is “Shift
Happens!” and we have watched parts of it

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.710
in an earlier Quotidian. The four-minute video,
pretty short, called Shift Happens sent shockwaves

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:56.240
around the world. I am showing you just two
screengrabs from that video. See how Concrete

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:13.129
the message is! The first one says, “If
you are one 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:20.570
in a million in China, … careful, you are
actually having 1300 people just like you!”

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:29.920
Their population is so high! And then, he
slaps you again with India. A tidbit about

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.790
India’s humongous population. The population
of its youth. The burgeoning population. He

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:44.860
says, “The 25% of India’s population with
the highest IQs, is greater than the total

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:53.600
population of the United States..” and because
it is not very clear, he gives a better takeaway!

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:01.009
“Translation: India has more honors kids
than America HAS kids!” Every class has

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:07.150
a topper kid.. You take all these toppers
and send them to America, America has only

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.371
that many kids! Imagine! Something concrete,
something tangible, something that we can

00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:22.550
immediately pick up and share. “Shareworthy”
comes from that!

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:30.040
The next C is for Credible. Credible doesn’t
mean you need a genius performer to tell you,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.460
so you believe them.. JK Rowling tells you
that she wrote Harry Potter using a specific

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.419
pen, and you immediately plop for it.. No.
Not necessarily. Don’t you remember a Sachin

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.940
Tendulkar telling you to buy the Reynold’s
Pen? Look at this. It doesn’t get any better

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:54.890
than this! The Gillette ad plays, featuring
Lt Col M K Sinha, who says “It has been

00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:02.860
19 years now, and I have been gliding the
Gillette Mach 3 comfortably over my seven-inch

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.630
battle scar. Seven thousand close shaves,
and who would know about close shaves better

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.839
than me?! Gillette Mach 3!” Remember this
ad? This man, a lieutenant colonel, injured

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:16.580
at war, a seven-inch scar, when he says, I
get a close shave, I know about close shaves..

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.779
what a play of words there.. And, how much
credibility flows naturally from there! Even

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:28.959
on such a irregular skin surface, if this
razor can shave smoothly, without cuts, that

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:35.940
is Credibility. So, when you share your message,
ensure there is Credibility. We have seen

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:45.050
this before. Logos. Ethos. Pathos. That Ethos
is Credibility. “Oh, she is saying this?

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.750
That means it is believable!”

00:09:49.750 --> 00:10:00.580
The next is Emotional. E for Emotional. This
is the result from One Day International number

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:09.310
3148. Partnerships statistics.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.610
Best performance by batters and bowlers.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.610
Here is the Manhattan.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.880
Perhaps, the Worms are going to be useful
too.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:31.579
Fine? All good? Nice? Go on. The Show is over!
What was that match? This was that match!

00:10:31.579 --> 00:10:38.959
This single moment, this photograph tells
us everything we need to know! Tells us stuff

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:48.019
that we simply couldn’t understand when
we were bombarded with data! Data is Logos.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:55.290
Boring. Useful probably for a mathematician
and a statistician. Common mere mortals like

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:03.010
us won’t understand, won’t make sense,
of this. This? Sachin, lifting the World Cup..

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:08.570
Virat Kohli exclaiming, “Sachin had shouldered
the country’s responsibility all these years,

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:14.580
and perhaps, just once, let us bear Sachin
on OUR shoulders! This is our fortune, it

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:23.260
is our pride!” That moment! We all remember
what we were doing when we were watching this

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:31.541
match, and history was being written! Emotional!
So, if you want to convey a message, ensure

00:11:31.541 --> 00:11:38.690
there is Emotion in what you do. Ensure it
evokes Emotions in the recipient. We talked

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:44.910
about memories, we even sauntered past the
seven sins of memory. If you have to embed

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:54.060
it deeply, it has to be multidimensional,
we had said. If you can load that little memory

00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:03.540
with Emotion, perhaps Anger, perhaps Laughter,
perhaps Regret, if you can just bring some

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:11.829
kind of Emotion that attaches on to it, it
becomes a lot heavier, not easily dislodged.

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:15.860
It is a nifty Trick!

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:26.230
S is for Storyworthy. Can you spin a story
with this? Is it worthy of narrating a story?

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:33.839
Then, it becomes sticky, it becomes something
that goes deep into my mind, and it comes

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:38.329
to the tip of my tongue.. and the next time
I talk about something to somebody, I slip

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:47.510
it through.. That is how viral concepts spread.
The artist creator of this strip is R K Laxman.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:57.000
A famous cartoonist. R K Narayan’s brother.
He created a character, a nameless character,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.760
called The Common Man. It ran in the Times
of India for nearly forty years or so. Even

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:10.810
won awards for being the most circulated cartoon
character.. and so on. This Common Man! Why

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:17.709
did it become so famous? Without even a name?
With some silly torn clothes, an old man..

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:27.950
why? People who read and watched his cartoon
immediately related to that Common Man. He

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:34.680
will talk about the rising petrol prices.
Every one of us is impacted by this hiked

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:44.079
price. He will talk about salaries.. About
promotions. That middle-class mentality. He

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:53.520
will touch upon politicians. And greased palms.
Yes. We have suffered it all too. Suffering

00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.759
in silence, you get a partner, you immediately
relate, and you lap it all up.. So, if you

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:05.300
can make something Storyworthy… What is
the story in this picture? The topic is the

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:11.120
“Man on the Moon” project. ISRO’s Space
Center — they bring a person in.. And why?

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:20.180
This is the message! “This is our man!”
exclaims one scientist.. “He can survive

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:36.020
without water, food, light, air, shelter..!”
Wow! So, that is Storyworthy! When you make

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:42.509
something Storyworthy, you are actually CREATING
a surrogate experience. When you listen to

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:49.000
a story, it is not the story that is amazing.
We become the hero / heroine in it, and it

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.290
is WE WHO feel AMAZING about it. When the
hero encounters hardships, you tell yourself,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:04.160
yes, I have suffered these too! It is an “almost
experience”. And that is why stories stick!

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:14.300
We saw those SIX letters. Simple. Unexpected.
Concrete. Credible. Emotional. Storyworthy.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:21.790
I see it like this though. A house. It is
burning. You are going to escape and run out.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:28.139
What are you going to grab on your way out?
If there is something Simple, yes, you will

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:35.279
grab that and run. If it is Complicated, you
will not perhaps consider it. Unexpected.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:43.110
Different. New. Nowhere else to be found.
If you have something special and unique like

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:48.050
that, … for example, at our home, we have
a Panchamukha Anjaneyar idol. Couldn’t get

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:56.569
it easily. Looked far and wide to buy one.
I will grab that, surely..! Concrete. If it

00:15:56.569 --> 00:16:07.980
is easy to lift, with two proper handles,
will you consider it? Or, something that is

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:16.000
loosely bound, not solid, messy? Has to be
Concrete. What about Credibility? If you have

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.790
a JK Rowling-signed Harry Potter book with
you, .. unless you have a holographic proof

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.509
that this is the real thing, you may not consider
it.. What if this is something anybody could

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:33.570
have fudged anyway? Credibility is important.
What about Emotion? If you have something,

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:40.360
it might mean nothing to anybody else. It
might be just a little pencil. Almost down

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:47.569
to the last centimeter. But, if this is my
Grandpa’s? The one he used to write his

00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:51.319
daily expenses account with? If I am having
this in his remembrance, … if that emotional

00:16:51.319 --> 00:16:59.810
tug exists..? Somebody I knew once had a Dairy
Milk wrapper.. inside a book. I asked him,

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:05.530
what on earth are you holding on to that for?
It is going to attract ants, for godssake!

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:11.510
My partner, my life-partner, before we got
married, she gave a gift to me, a Dairy Milk

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:18.220
wrapper, a gift for someone you love.. That
is what would be written on that wrapper..

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.809
It was Dairy Milk’s slogan those days! That’s
Emotion. Loaded. Even if the house is all

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:29.169
but burnt down, I would rush out with that
wrapper! And, like I said, the story about

00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:35.600
the gift for someone you love, it should be
Storyworthy. These are the things we would

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.150
want to rush out with, yes? That is what you
need to do when you are trying to convey a

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:47.740
message. Success. Hey.. Success? Spelling?
Succes? What happened to the last S? Oh, is

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.060
that the summary we just went through? Probably!

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:57.260
Talking about spellings, remember this guy?
At four hundred and thirty, he interviewed

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:03.990
me. His name? Micheal Jeshua Aswin. See the
spelling. Mi…Mee… Meh.. Micheal..? Michael?

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:15.730
Mike? I googled.. To check out if this is
a popular name at all.. And, this is what

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:24.970
Google suggested. Try again with this! Michael!
When you do these little spelling changes,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:33.330
you are basically doing U.. Unexpected. Something
different.. Michael, we all know how to pronounce.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:41.040
But, Micheal? How do you pronounce this? You
spend a little extra time. You move from subconscious,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:47.169
unconscious, to conscious effort. And when
you do that, things become memorable. You

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:57.530
are not going to forget this man. His hair-style.
His dark glasses. And his name. Made to Stick!

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:08.060
Thank you! We will meet soon!
