00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.310
This person’s name is Carl Gustav Jung.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.250
A Swiss psychiatrist.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.610
He talks about the meeting of two personalities.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.440
Two people…

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.539
If they come together with their own personalities…

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.730
The meeting of two personalities is like the
coming together of two chemical substances..

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.210
Why?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.210
He says…

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.860
If at all there is a reaction, they both are
transformed.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.910
They will not be like what they were before..

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.890
Like Sodium Chloride..

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.219
A poisonous chemical like Sodium gets together
with a nauseating gas like Chlorine, it becomes

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.280
a common substance like table salt!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:58.100
The coming together of two diverse personalities..!

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.409
Namaste!

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.720
Synthesis!

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.990
From nothing, from a few pieces, creating
something.. something of value..

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.750
something that you’ll probably find use
for in the future.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.750
Synthesis..

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.750
Creation!

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.760
We are studying this book at Zoho Schools.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.590
Designing with the Mind in Mind — by Jeff
Johnson.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.799
Hey.. who’s going to use that product?

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:39.799
People.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.090
What’s the most important tool that they
possess?

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.090
Mind!

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.189
Imagine that Mind in your Mind when designing
stuff for people..!

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:57.100
The book talks about how the human eyesight
is flawed and weak, your perception of movement

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.520
is poor, your central vision is different
from your peripheral vision, your attention

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.619
is sporadic, … the book keeps criticising..
human beings for their shortfall!

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.510
And, he ends with, this is the imperfect being
for which we are designing, … so, design

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.660
with care!

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.220
In that book, he talks about two important
words.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.050
One is called the “Feature” (feature-driving
reading, feature-driven seeing, feature-driven

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.630
understanding).

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.630
The other is “Context”.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.530
The situation.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.530
The scenario.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.840
Context-driven learning or understanding.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.430
We considered an example at class.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.590
Assume there is a person.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.319
Who has a brain.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.349
Those five sense organs are actually not smart.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.820
They are dumb.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.680
They just get what’s happening around them.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680
Smell.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680
Taste.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680
Sound.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680
Sight.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680
Whatever..

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.069
After taken them all in, it just obediently
transfers it to the brain.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:11.950
It’s the brain that puts them all together
and synthesises meaning.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.409
Synthesises a sense of understanding, the
author says in the book.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.860
Assume this is a person, and we present an
apple to that person.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.030
If it is feature-driven, “wow, green apple,
fresh, with a leaf sticking out, i want to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.640
eat it”, … and you start salivating!

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.520
Your pupil dilates..!

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.849
Everything starts happening!

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.560
But, what is the Context here?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.680
This guy could be somebody you wronged yesterday.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.209
If he is going to gift you a green apple,
… won’t you immediately start wondering

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.629
if it has been injected with a poisonous liquid??

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.989
What if he has five apples and he gives you
one?

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.829
Would you like that?

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:20.870
What if it is rotten on the other side,..
what if this girl who is giving it to you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.530
(Oh, her name is not Eve by the way!), if
this girl who is giving this apple to you,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.330
.. you know that she hates apples..!

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.020
How will your perception about this whole
thing..

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.080
what meaning will you synthesise?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.160
How will that change!?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:47.020
History, memory, other sense organs putting
in data, stuff you’ve read about on the

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.240
internet, all these come together, and … for
mankind to really survive and thrive, it is

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.990
not the sense organs that He is dependent
on.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.060
Based on the input given to the sense organs,
based on the prior knowledge that you have

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.669
gathered, He synthesises new meaning and new
understand.

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.400
That is why He survives!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.130
I am reading this book for my mom.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.880
The fourteenth book in the Mahabharat series,
written by Shri Jeyamohan.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.210
In this book, Arjuna goes into hiding..

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:34.640
In incognito mode, he takes the form of a
transgender and becomes a dance teacher.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.440
One soldier, doubting that something is afoot,
accosts Arjuna (Brihannala is her name!) and

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.900
asks, “What are you teaching the princess?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.500
Is that really dance?!”

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.460
And Arjuna gives a very beautiful answer for
that.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:06:01.120
I wanted to share that with you, for I think
this is applicable to almost any teacher-student

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.460
relationship.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.200
The soldier complains that the princess is
not receiving what Arjuna is giving, but something

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200
else altogether.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.319
To which Arjuna quips, “No student absorbs
exactly what a teacher gives them!

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.800
The teacher can only sow the seed.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:24.180
What grows and how, is left to the soil quality,
the moisture, the humidity, the fertiliser,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.760
available there.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.760
Synthesis.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760
Again!

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.500
We just saw that!

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.979
Okay, I will take you to Mr. Bloom.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:40.030
Benjamin Bloom came up with a framework.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.509
a pyramid-like, triangle-like framework.

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.069
Some of you might have surely heard!

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.069
Bloom’s Taxonomy.

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.190
See where synthesis sits on this pyramid.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.190
Two columns.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.810
One called Cognitive.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.099
Another called Affective (emotion-based).

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.280
In each column, your understanding grows,
slowly, gradually.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.770
This is Dr. Benjamin Bloom.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:10.750
As you can see, you first receive knowledge.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.500
Nothing more.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.750
And then, you understand, comprehend, you
get into a conversation with the teacher.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.449
And slowly, it becomes application, using
what you learned.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:28.729
Also, what you learned today, what you learned
some other day, what you learned from somebody

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:35.400
else, … you learn to assign different levels
of values to them.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.479
The next level is, you learn to analyse why
something happens the way it does.

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:47.979
And you learn to organise all the stuff you
have learned from all over.

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:52.590
You learn to put them all together into a
body of knowledge.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.979
Final level is Synthesis.

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:56.759
In both cases.

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.750
Stuff you create by yourself.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.629
It could be a new kind of understanding.

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:05.069
It could be a new way of putting things together.

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:09.190
You learn to tie something you learned somewhere
long ago and something you learned just now,

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:14.039
and thus, you create new understanding.

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:19.720
Synthesis is that Black Belt in the pyramid
of understanding.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.379
Elon Musk is in the news today.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.840
He has evicted the CEO of Twitter on the first
day since assuming office, and many are unhappy

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.539
about it and many others are happy too.

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:29.650
Some are mocking at him as if he were a crackpot.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.210
According to me though, he has done a lot
of good stuff.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.770
And, we should admire him for that, learn
from him, be inspired and motivated by him.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.900
We should wonder if there is something for
us all to learn from him, from that all.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:47.660
This man, unhappy that his - I think he has
five children - his children are not getting

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:53.110
good education at school, he decided to create
a school.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.589
He calls it Synthesis.

00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:04.390
He created it as a web-solution too, so any
child in any corner of the world, though a

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.160
bit costly, can learn something meaningful.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.519
Feeling that this approach is probably the
best approach to prepare these children for

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:18.000
the uncertain future looming ahead…

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.100
He proposes something called the Synthesis
Approach.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.211
Three important pillars comprise it.

00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:28.060
The first one is grading..

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.650
“Let’s not do grading”.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:35.540
Don’t jump to the conclusion, .. oh, well,
I have heard of many who don’t rank and

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.540
rate students.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.570
Why, even Zoho Schools doesn’t.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.570
No!

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.500
That’ not the crux of the matter here!

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.260
This one goes well beyond that!

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.779
There is no class level.

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:49.269
There is no concept like Grade Four or Grade
Eight.

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:50.410
Across ages, they come together.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.060
Some progress very fast, and by the age of
eight, they are already equivalent in grade

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.990
to that of a Class Twelve student.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.820
Some others, who are slower at it, who probably
grasp things after further effort and thought,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.410
well, they are eighteen years of age, but
just in Grade Ten.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.069
No problem, says Elon.

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:06.459
Ditch the grade.

00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:10.360
Then, he says, too often we are focused on
problem solving..

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.180
How to fix this thing.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.459
Then he says, too often we are focused on
Tool Learning.

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:20.269
How do we use This tool.

00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:24.010
Followed by how do we use THAT tool.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.410
That is wrong..

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.940
If given a problem, our aim should be, what
are the tools needed to solve this problem,

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.779
and how do I learn to use those tools, in
this context.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:37.920
Probably, the third fundamental pillar comes
from the second one.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.060
The third one is, let us learn when we need
it.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.060
Not before that.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.550
Where is the internet going to run away, after
all?

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.560
Where are these teachers going to vanish,
any way!

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.170
Where are these colleagues going away to,
after all?!

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.300
On-Demand learning and not Just-in-case learning.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.869
Because, this Just-in-case Learning has been
imposed on us for ages by our ancestors.

00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:05.120
And that is because, the world of knowledge,
then, was a pretty small circle.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.320
This is the world.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.300
This is the circle of knowledge.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.160
Of all known information.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160
This is it.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.160
Just memorise this, by rote.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160
And that would be all.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160
But now, it has exploded.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.540
Like a Big Bang had occurred.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:23.760
Even if you had been learning and studying
all your life, in one narrow domain, you still

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.100
would have probably just scratched the surface.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.459
That is how much and how fast information
has exploded.

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:32.920
So, sorry, learn it on demand.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.300
Take two minutes.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.300
Just in time.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.490
Rather than Just in case.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.200
These are those three pillars that support
Synthesis.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.459
And, he also talks about four words.

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:50.730
Four important words that drive day to day
work at Synthesis.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.889
The first one is Grasping.

00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:55.410
These children are on this online program.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:02.800
They are given a guide, a senior teacher,
and let loose in an environment where there

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.570
are other children also.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.570
It is game-driven.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:11.050
The interesting thing about this is, the game,
you don’t know the rules!

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.870
You figure the rules out as you play!

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.570
Feels like you have heard this somewhere?!

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.570
Hello!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.890
Life itself is like that!

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.529
You don’t know the rules!

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:21.860
You fail!

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.240
You make mistakes!

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.250
You learn!

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.750
And then you realise you shouldn’t do that
again!

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.029
The second word is about Voice.

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:33.240
How to communicate with another person.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.710
And, communication is not just speaking, but
listening too.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:37.710
Understanding too.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.710
Feeling too.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.790
Don’t they say that?

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:45.269
That we are given two eyes and two ears and
just one mouth..

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:47.450
And that is for a reason!

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.450
Control.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.450
Listen.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.450
Watch.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.450
Observe!

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.450
That is something they learn.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.680
And then, they also learn Ownership.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.360
Own up to your mistakes.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.779
Be your own best critic.

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:07.529
If you make a mistake, disembody yourself,
look back at yourself, and look at your older

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:08.529
self.

00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:10.380
Criticise that person.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.870
Understand the mistakes.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.940
Only then you will be able to do better!

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.769
That is the third part — Ownership.

00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:19.800
And finally, Flow.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.630
Flow, we have talked about Flow many times.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.779
And this particular place, they use Flow as
celebrating the process.

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:29.980
The journey.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.760
And not really too particular about the destination.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.850
What do you pick up along the way..

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.240
That is the key.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.730
Synthesis, again, three different kinds of
synthesis.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:50.320
All pointing towards probably just one thing
— a better understanding of the world around

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.320
you.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.399
Do you remember this book?

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.399
Glue!

00:13:55.399 --> 00:14:00.840
In this book too, the author says, it is important
for you to synthesise.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.171
It may sound a little complicated and odd
— to hear about the word ‘synthesise’

00:14:03.171 --> 00:14:04.209
even in the world of team management.

00:14:04.209 --> 00:14:06.730
But, no, it is not some new and complicated
term.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.430
Don’t get all worked up.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:13.820
Take the simple Calvin and Hobbes example.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.380
That little boy is near his Dad.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.779
It is snowing outside, very cold, says the
Dad.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:26.350
The Son declares his intent about going out
to play, nevertheless.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.720
What’s the Mom doing?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.250
The Mom synthesises.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.529
She says, it is cold outside.

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:37.760
Take your jacket if you are going to go to
play.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.030
The Son’s intent is taken care of.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.519
The Dad’s fear has been allayed too.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:50.350
So, this is one simple example of synthesis,
says this author.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:54.930
Also, she gives a framework — three beautiful
steps.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:04.320
She says, first, as you go, as you keep going
ahead in your project, keep picking stuff

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.920
up.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.920
Like the snowball.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920
Like a magnet.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:16.560
Whatever you can absorb along the way, by
the time you reach a point where questions

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:25.860
are thrown at you, you are asked to make decisions,
you will be able to synthesise the right answer.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.930
The three-part-framework she gives, after
collecting, like a snowball is, do Inference.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.009
What is Inference?

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:35.540
We have collected a lot of pieces..

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.860
Are they all pieces of the same puzzle?

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.690
Do they even fit well?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.130
Is there something that doesn’t belong?

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.670
Is there…

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.130
That kind of search, inquiry, is what you
should embark on.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.410
That is Inference.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.380
That is the first way to put those pieces
together?

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.120
What is the second way to put those pieces
together?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.310
The stuff that you have picked up along the
way?

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.149
The stuff that is going to help you synthesise?

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:01.500
The second way is Serialisation.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.500
This..

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500
Followed by this..

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.740
Followed by that..

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.740
Oh..

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.620
Ok, there seems to be a step missing..

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.310
That leads you to another quest.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.560
For the missing piece.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.490
That is the second part of this three part
approach.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.340
What is the third part?

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.100
First, we saw one piece, that went along with
another piece.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.240
Then, we saw one piece, followed by another
piece, in sequence.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.660
What could be the third one?

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:37.200
The third one, of course, is story telling.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200
Can you stitch a narrative?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200
A meaningful story?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.449
Based on the pieces you have collected?

00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:42.889
Why is that important?

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:49.620
Because, when you tell a story, it is not
about just getting pieces together, not just

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.720
seeing them in sequence, but also, looking
at a Cause and Effect relationship.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.399
This, that along with this.

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:57.750
This, followed by that.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.440
This… and BECAUSE OF THIS that.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440
Cause.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440
Effect.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:10.270
And again, when you tell the story of the
cause and the effect, if you see something

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:18.069
that is rubbing you the wrong way, standing
out like a sore thumb, look at that, and address

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.069
that.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:23.710
That is how you get your complete set, so
that you can synthesise.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.780
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.679
But, there is a closing thought.

00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:32.880
The closing thought is actually a warning.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.120
For, this synthesis can cut both ways too..

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.660
Your imagination is your limit..

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.710
When somebody is talking to you, for example,
while I am presenting to you in this video,

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.690
I am sure you synthesised a lot..

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.480
Thankfully we are not facing each other, because
if we were facing each other in real life,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.090
right here, right now, probably you would
not have let me finish!

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.090
Sorry, wrong..

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.260
Sorry, this is better than that angle..

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.480
You would surely have brought something up.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:09.030
And so, to rein in the horses of your imagination,
at least some times, … here is a piece of

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.490
advice I found somewhere on the internet.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:17.220
I thought it was pretty interesting, and so
felt like sharing it with you.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:23.120
When you are in a listening mode, when absorbing,
observing, … to prevent yourself from spilling

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.240
and spewing forth too soon, .. just imagine
that this will happen.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.670
I am sure all of us know this popup by now..

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.840
Being recorded for quality purposes..

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.960
Or, you have given consent for this conversation
to be recorded…

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:46.220
won’t you get a little tense and panicky,
… ? Probably that pullback, that little

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:54.400
check is useful, in the long run, when you
have to check your horses of imagination from

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400
running wild and unbridled..

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.390
To understand fully, before synthesising,
and then speaking!

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.390
Thank you.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:10.929
Let us meet next week again.

00:19:10.929 --> 00:19:12.909
Bye!
