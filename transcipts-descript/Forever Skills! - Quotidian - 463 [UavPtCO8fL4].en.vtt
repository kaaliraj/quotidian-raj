00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.350
I used to look inside the “Grandpa Box”.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.980
Every family, every house, used to have one
such box, yes?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.420
Stuff that used to belong to Grandpa?

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.980
My Grandpa’s box had stuff like this.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.980
His handwriting.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.150
Scribbles by him.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.150
Could probably have been even “correspondences
of love”!

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.690
Who knows!

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.680
I used to see a lot of such correspondence!

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.649
I used to wonder, sometimes..

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.440
Why is the handwriting such a mess?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.920
It is completely unintelligible!

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.539
Until my Dad clarified to me that this was
actually something called Gregg’s Shorthand.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.140
Most of us may not even know what it is because
it is no longer a relevant skill.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.620
If somebody is dictating very fast, without
missing a single word, to write it all down,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.320
this was a language invented for that purpose..

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.900
A phonetic, scribbling approach.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.770
Nobody had devices back then.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
Audio / Video devices.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.700
In fact, there was no concept of LIVE, either.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.700
This is okay..

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.450
Acceptable, given the circumstances.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.750
But, look at this.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.830
This is a test.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.320
You will have to type this.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.810
They are not asking for an answer.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.390
They aren’t giving you a question and asking
for an answer.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.670
They are giving you the answer!

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.970
You just have to type it out!

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.070
On a typewriter!

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.140
So many words per minute.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.219
You have to type.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.670
This is AFTER ChatGPT, by the way.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.140
This is a question paper from February 2023.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.010
Is this still a relevant skill??

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.530
Can you even dream of typing faster than a
printer can do it?

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.420
In the world of voice to text, is this even
relevant?

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.190
Is it relevant or not?

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.340
What does relevant even mean?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:28.700
That is what we are going to see today.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.849
Namaste!

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:44.950
We are going to see skills that are seen as
important today, and wonder if they will still

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.370
be relevant in the future.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.810
What are the Forever Skills?

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.880
Because, see, a person working in this shop,
the classic kirana store, a grocery shop,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.800
the challenges he faces…

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:15.310
Mental mathematics, decisions on restocking,
gut feels about which customer can be believed,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.630
who owes how much to us still, where do we
start a new branch, the merchant..

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.920
Much of it, mental.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.860
The challenges he faces, the skills he needs,
that he has been needing for generations now,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.980
they are very different from the challenges
these people face.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.450
A high-tech work environment.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.159
Probably a hybrid work environment.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.430
Probably even a timezone-separated work environment.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.650
How do you manage somebody who is working
from home..

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.290
How do you manage, while working from home?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.052
(Both are different things altogether, by
the way!)

00:03:58.052 --> 00:04:01.819
The challenges are different, the skills needed
are different.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.340
That is what we encountered when we saw this
book.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.930
I even remember saying, “Please don’t
read this book.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.810
We are going to revisit it!”

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.160
Forever Skills, is the name of the book.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.500
Twelve skills to future proof yourself, your
team, and your kids!

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.940
What are those twelve skills, let us do a
short, fast journey, shall we?

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.470
But, before we get into that journey though,
I want to tell you about the three spheres

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.470
of change.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:45.729
In this book, they refer to the oncoming tsunami
of change in the future, and refer to three

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:46.790
different sub-changes.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.419
One is “What’s Changing”.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:59.100
The other is “What’s Unchanging”.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.060
And the third thing is, “What needs to be
Changed”!

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.259
What is remaining unchanged.

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.470
What should change.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.730
And how do we change it.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:17.960
One should look into the future from these
three dimensions — the authors say.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.670
The twelve skills are divided into three sets
of four subskills.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.250
So, it talks about Creativity.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.330
If you are to differentiate yourself from
a computer, a robot, an artificially intelligent

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:40.820
program, that last bastion, that last skill
that will remain unchallenged, may well be

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.199
Creativity.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.410
That is the ultimate.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.200
That is the irreproducible.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.210
That is the non-automatable.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.410
(Not sure for how long though!)

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:58.260
The second is Communication.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.039
You deciding to share your idea with another.

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.710
Or a group of others.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.860
The art of persuasion.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:16.039
And, finally, what are you actually capable
of, what are you incapable of, what is within

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.840
your control, what needs to be perhaps endured
because it is outside your control, that is

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.479
important to be understood.

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:29.830
So, in these three top-level categories, we
are going to see four skills each.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.080
Let us run through them.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.940
I am going to use examples from timeless stories..

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.630
Remember Aesop’s short stories, fables,
moral lessons?

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.940
We have read many, haven’t we?

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:48.880
I am going to weave these twelve skills along,
using those fables as the background tapestry.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.830
The first skill in Creativity is Insight.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.650
The Crow in this story, had an insight.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.099
It did not just analyse the data it had.

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:58.099
It understood it.

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:05.110
That is why, it saw a pebble, and realised
that it can raise the level of the water in

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.920
the jug by dropping it into the vessel.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.759
It looked at it from a different viewpoint.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.759
And that helped.

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.720
And, it looked for patterns also.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:21.030
It had seen something elsewhere, it saw something
similar, it raised the level of the water,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.300
and it enjoyed.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.650
If we were to look for another word for it,
it is “Sensemaking”.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.030
Making sense of what you perceive in the world.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.710
Sifting through it.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.750
Analysing it.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.190
Distilling it.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.350
That is Insight.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.450
That is going to be a very important Future
Skill.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.750
Do you remember this story?

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.850
Sing a song?

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.940
Doughnut drops from the crow’s beak.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.330
They call it Conversion.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.500
What is Conversion?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:01.230
Well, only if you are absorbing numerous things,
all the time, can you really Convert.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.550
I have seen this elsewhere, from a different
perspective..

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.690
Sideways thinking — we have seen it in Quotidians
earlier.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.629
Tangential approaches.

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:15.319
Sidelong glances.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:16.319
Leaps of Creativity.

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.319
Those leaps?

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:20.370
They will come only if you generate collisions.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:26.139
Some concept somewhere in one domain, some
other concept, somewhere else, in another

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.199
domain.

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:31.169
The doughnut in the mouth..

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:34.440
If it has to be made to fall..

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.360
One has to understand that the mouth is not
just for eating, but for singing too!

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.740
That is what the Fox did with the Crow.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.850
That is what is special!

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.060
The third Creativity Future Skill is Problem
Solving.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.870
There is a problem..

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.510
We need to resolve it..

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:01.250
The first thing you need to have for that
then, is a Love for Problem Solving.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.900
You need to be okay thinking in questions,
not statements.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.900
What if, Why not…

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.640
One has to adopt a lot of approaches.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:21.100
If you make a mistake, you need to understand
what went wrong, learn a lesson, and try again

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.100
and progress.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.100
Many of you will know this story.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.100
A donkey slips and falls.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.230
And, the cargo that it had been carrying is
salt, and it dissolves in the river, and hence

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.510
lightens its load.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:38.480
And, so, from that day on, every time the
donkey crosses that river, it stumbles on

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.480
purpose, and reduces its load.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.140
This guy notices..

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.120
And decides to arrive at a resolution for
this.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.490
He loads the donkey with sponges.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.360
Cotton.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:02.120
The donkey stumbles on purpose, falls, and
the weight, instead of lightening, becomes

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120
manifold!

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.850
It learns its mistake.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.160
That is not the lesson for us here though.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.210
Problem Solving.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.089
Looking at a situation.

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:14.519
Looking at it through questions.

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:16.390
And thinking What If.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.670
That is going to be an important skill.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:26.459
And finally, the fourth skill in the realm
of Creativity, is Agility.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.750
Fast.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.050
Instantly.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.339
Instinctively.

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:31.740
In an Agile manner.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.850
With celerity.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.630
Do you remember this story?

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:42.500
The image shows a shark, but one version of
the story also uses a crocodile.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.889
The shark takes the monkey along, offering
to give it a delicious meal cooked by its

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:48.889
wife.

00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:51.269
The monkey, idiotic monkey, accepts the ride.

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:58.470
But, only halfway in, the shark gloats that
the monkey has been cheated, and the actual

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.589
plan is to eat the heart of the monkey.

00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:04.980
But that’s when the monkey demonstrates
Agility.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.600
It says, “Oh my my, why didn’t you tell
me earlier?

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.780
I had just removed my heart and kept it hanging
from the tree..

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.389
I would have fixed it in and come along…”

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.000
That’s Agile thinking.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.960
And that’s going to be needed.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.980
What are the demonstrative qualities in Agile
Thinking?

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.960
Remember “Firm Convictions Loosely Held”?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.280
We had encountered it in earlier Quotidians.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.050
Yes, hold on to a conviction.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.250
But, hold on to it loosely.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:42.459
If you get a better conviction, immediately
be able to jump to it..!

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:45.220
That is a Creativity Skill.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.380
A Future Proof Skill.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.150
The next category is Communication.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:58.250
Your idea, conveyed forcefully, impactfully,
to one or many people around you.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.560
The first subskill in that, is the art of,
or the ability to Influence.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.790
How many fables have we seen, featuring the
wise old fox or the cunning fox?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.860
The fox is a weakling.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.610
It can’t even hunt properly.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.779
It is one-fourth the size of a lion.

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:23.680
But, in numerous stories, in numerous instances,
it has led the lion into traps!

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.150
How many times it has been a wise counsel
for the lion!

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.150
Why?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.290
That is because of its ability to communicate,
its ability to influence.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:42.290
If something has to be conveyed influentially,
as we have seen already, Start with Why.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.690
Have a story?

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:50.449
Why do you think I picked so many stories
for you?

00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:51.760
Because they ring a bell.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.000
When you see these images, you will immediately
be reminded of so many nostalgic moments from

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.529
childhood, and hence it will prepare the fertile
bed in which I can sow the idea.

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:09.820
And, once you have that idea, once you have
that story, you need to spread it, share it,

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:15.230
and when you share it, don’t give instructions,
but instead, inspire them by sharing achievements

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:20.320
and pinnacles reached by those who followed
that advice!

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.250
When you spread such a story, it becomes a
value system and people start adopting it

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.590
immediately.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.540
The second skill in Communication is Team
Building.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.339
Do you remember this story?

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:40.100
Many of us would have read this story as,
“There were many oxen.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.769
They were so united.

00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:44.699
The lion couldn’t attack them.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.890
The oxen kept butting him off.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:52.150
Always, one of those oxen was always on the
lookout, helping.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:14:01.380
And then, the fox comes, yes the same fox,
gives advice to that lion, creates a divisiveness,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.590
splits them up, and helps the lion devour
the pack one by one.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.700
You COULD also read it, rarely, .. in some
African versions, thus:- The oxen were separate

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.700
and disunited.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.980
Each minding its own business.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.339
The lion used to have a field day, attacking
them one by one.

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:19.730
Some of the oxen discuss and decide, “Why
can’t we be united.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.220
Why can’t we bring ourselves together?

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.310
You run fast.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.980
You on the other hand are tall.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.490
You, by the way, have amazing eyesight..”

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:36.820
They all come together and become a single
unified beast, that can run fast, that is

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.389
tall, and has great eyesight.

00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:42.449
And so, the lion is not able to attack any
longer.

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:48.810
So, create a culture people want to be part
of.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:54.480
And, don’t just connect everybody with yourself,
the team leader.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.190
Connect everybody with each other, that is
the role of a team leader, says the author.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:06.080
So, Team Building becomes a very important
future-focused Skill.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080
Trust.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.620
Do you remember this story?

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.680
One of them asks, “What did the bear tell
you?

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.910
I was in a hurry to save myself, I climbed
up the tree.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.250
I saw the bear come near you, and whisper
something into your ear, that’s what it

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.250
seemed like..

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.250
What’s up?”

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.410
And the other person says, “Don’t trust
those who seem to be fairweather friends,

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.470
and rush away at the first sight of danger”.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:35.480
Moral of the story apart, if you want to create
Trust, you need to tell the truth, not when

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.890
it is convenient, but when it makes you vulnerable.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:46.300
If you can demonstrate that you will not stray
from the path of truth, even if it means you

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.779
will be caught in a quandary, that is how
you create a layer of Trust.

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:54.000
And, you have to walk the talk.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.500
You have to perform everything that you expect
the others to do.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.269
That is the mark of a true leader.

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:06.190
The benchmark of a leader who wants to inspire
that Trust.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.970
Be a thought leader.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.690
Trust is an important ingredient if you want
to communicate well.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.480
That is the medium through which the communication
happens.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.079
The final Communication subskill is Translation.

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:26.700
You all know this story.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.019
An elephant.

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:29.990
Many blind men.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.339
Each person interprets the animal differently.

00:16:33.339 --> 00:16:39.360
Recently though, in a meeting I was in, people
were discussing this picture, and one of them

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.220
gave a very interesting twist to this old
story.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:49.959
They said, this is exactly what happens in
our company.

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:53.910
The CEO, or the senior manager, gives a vision.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.730
Conveys that this is to be done.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:08.339
But, a designer or a developer or a marketer,
or a sales person, looks at it, each of them

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:17.060
blind metaphorically speaking, and they understand
something, and they implement it their way..

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.929
Removing the blindfold blinkers from each
person?

00:17:19.929 --> 00:17:22.390
That is in your hands.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.000
That is where you play an important role.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.660
Don’t add jargon.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:33.620
If something happened, if it is complicated,
the task of simplifying it is yours!

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620
Don’t inform.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.620
Don’t distribute.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.620
Educate.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.580
And, when educating, whatever you say, make
it accessible.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.630
Can a simpleton understand it..

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.790
Make it achievable.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.070
Can an average person REACH the goal?

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.549
And make it actionable.

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:58.799
Don’t make them wonder, “Story was good,
but what is it that you want me to do?!”

00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:08.210
Give them something to do.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.280
That is Translation, an important Skill.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.059
Finally, the Control aspect.

00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:18.800
Four qualities there.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.620
The first Skill, is Self Control.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.020
Understanding yourself very well.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.429
Keeping a good control over yourself at all
times.

00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:32.179
Do you remember this story?

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:34.270
Two cocks get into a fight.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.270
One wins.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.659
The other slinks away.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:44.480
The victor, unable to control itself, climbs
up a roof to proclaim its world-beater status..

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:51.480
The eagle looking for prey, swoops down and
grabs the easy picking.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:19:00.390
And, the losing cock will actually win the
day, for that is going to be the head of the

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.880
roost from then on.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.480
So, self-control is very important.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.070
Be self-aware.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:14.410
Focusing narrowly, rather than spreading yourself
distractedly.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.760
Control what you can.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:23.400
Don’t obsess about things that you can’t
possibly control.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:30.760
And finally, if you are suffused with emotion,
it is actually a feedback to something that

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.940
has happened to you.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:39.010
And that feedback may not always be true — keep
that in mind.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.010
That self-awareness?

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:45.260
That is the first Forever Skill under the
Control aspect.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:50.220
Secondly, they advise that Resource Management
is very important.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.630
What do you have?

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.020
What are you going to do with those?

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.260
You have to spend it wisely.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.500
You have to create value.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.559
Something meaningful out of something meaningless.

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.500
The timing is everything.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.760
Do you do it at the right time, in the right
place?

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.310
You also have to assume things could go wrong.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.310
Do you remember this story?

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.910
The Musicians of Bremen?

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:20.220
A dog, a donkey, a cat, a cock, chased away
from their respective homes..

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.970
For having outlived their usefulness.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:29.460
But they come together, they use their resources
well, they drive away some theives in a house..

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.179
An interesting story — read it if you haven’t
yet.

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:34.960
They don’t even have good skills.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.080
They can’t even sing well.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.590
But, they come together to create an orchestra.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.070
The Musicians of Bremen.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:46.789
This is what should come to your mind when
you think about optimised resource management

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:49.790
which is an important Forever Skill.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.790
Order.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:59.870
In that story, the Ant seems to be working
round the clock.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:04.900
While the Grasshopper keeps playing all the
time.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.409
And, we think, the Ant is a future-conscious
animal.

00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:11.429
An insect concerned about the rainy days coming.

00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:13.100
Not really.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.100
The Ant likes ORDER.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:20.809
In the mind of the insect, there is this little
thing called “bringing order from chaos”

00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:23.571
embedded as a genetic code in its little brain.

00:21:23.571 --> 00:21:24.571
Go in a line.

00:21:24.571 --> 00:21:26.120
Work this much.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.740
As an obsession.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.289
So, have something like that in your own daily
life.

00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:37.070
Establish a routine that allows you to strive
for clarity.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.669
Is everything foggy?

00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:43.610
Aim for clearing the air.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:56.440
Something that allows you to 
get closer to certainty.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.530
It is uncertain now, perhaps.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.980
But, if I do this regularly, will it get me
closer to certainty?

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.140
Establish a convention.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.740
Do it if you can.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.240
Don’t do it if you can’t.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.179
But, don’t make us think you can do it when
you actually can’t!

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:17.039
Are you even predictable.

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.440
Aim for accountability.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.230
Why do we establish a convention?

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.720
Everything can’t be documented in a rulebook.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.290
So, we try to tell you, “Hey, how about
we take this as a convention.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.430
It won’t be written.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.550
But, we take this as a thumbrule.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:38.090
When you don’t have any documentation, this
is how you have to do it”.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.340
That is aiming for Order.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.400
And, finally, Implementation.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.820
Anybody can talk hot air!

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.250
But, one needs to DEMONSTRATE!

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:56.140
An ounce of actual implementation is worth
pounds of empty talk, they say.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.140
Remember this story?

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.690
Who will bell the cat?

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.570
The mice, each of them will propose something
amazing.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.799
One would talk about a radar device.

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.710
Another would propose a GPS finder.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.630
Another, a bell, plain and simple.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.630
A battery-operated….

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:18.059
But that is when the wizened old mouse will
ask, “All that is fine, but who will bell

00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:19.059
the cat?”

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:20.240
That is implementation-focus.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.380
Make mistakes, that’s alright.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.440
But, MAKE.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.510
Fail early.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.580
Fail often.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.900
Have few options.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.820
Don’t get caught in analysis paralysis.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.110
Finish what you started.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.840
It is not enough to begin.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.890
You need to finish.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:42.150
And finally, don’t do anything expecting
a specific result.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.490
Enjoy the journey.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.840
Learn the lessons in the journey.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.919
Go back to re-implementation.

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:54.220
That is the twelfth of the Forever Skills
that we saw today.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.480
Twelve Eternal Skills.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:04.080
As a closing thought, I would like to share
an important quote from this Greek philosopher,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080
Heraclitus.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.390
He said, “No one steps into the same river
twice.”

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.320
(Two reasons!)

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:26.320
“For, it is not the same river, and they
are not the same person”.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.409

00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:40.110
So, we live a life filled with experiences.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:49.390
If we scrutinise every experience, and look

00:24:49.390 --> 00:25:00.070
my Mental Model, correct flawed models, add
fine nuances to it, you are set for life.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:11.230
Thank you, we will meet again next week!
