00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.670
Namaste!

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.800
This animal is called the Chippendale Mupp.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.400
It is featured in the famous Dr. Seuss stories.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.780
Well, it has got a unique speciality.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.530
It doesn’t have an alarm clock, and all
that.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.460
It just has a very long tail.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.080
Just before going to bed, it will bite the
end of its tail, and then go to bed.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.550
How will it wake up?

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.010
It will wake up with an Ouch.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.010
Pain.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.319
The pain will travel from the end of the tail
to its brain.

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:39.319
Slowly.

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:40.949
It has got such a long tail, you see!

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.210
Or, thus goes the nonsense-story by Dr. Seuss.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.780
No, that is not the Long Tail that we are
talking about, here, though!

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.319
This one is a long tail of a different kind!

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:58.840
I grew up, listening to the amazing adventure
stories of Tarzan, narrated by my Dad.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
Tarzan the Ape Man.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.119
The Jungle Man.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.000
Deep in the African jungle, a little boy found
and nurtured by man-like Apes…

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.219
A long and interesting story.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:07.829
I am a big big fan!

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:18.720
Every time you get the first rank or win an
award, I will get you a Tarzan book, my Dad

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720
said.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.370
Wanting to encourage me and make me perform.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.300
And I went for it, and I started, every year,
Annual Day, I would get some award, and the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.359
next evening, he would take me to the Higginbothams
Store in Chennai, and we will get a book.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:41.640
The problem is, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote
24 books and before I could collect them all,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.240
(I am a completionist — if I start something,
I want to finish it to perfection)… before

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.590
I could collect them all, they went out of
print, they were not available in bookstores

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.590
any more.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.680
I really struggled a lot.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.990
After that, many many many years later, I
finally bought the 25th book…

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.509
This is the 25th book — not even written
by Edgar Rice Burroughs!

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.970
Halfway into the writing of this book, he
passed away!

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.170
Lansdale finished writing the remainder of
the book.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.230
How?

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.590
Thanks to Kindle.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.120
Thanks to the World Of Digital.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.480
This is where the Long Tail that I was referring
to, comes into its own.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.200
The problem is, be they CDs, books, any music
discs, games, they occupy space.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.120
And, if you talk to shopkeepers, they will
say, this is the bestsellers area.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.980
If I keep a book here, it takes up one centimetre
distance, one centimetre length!

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.549
And I can’t keep another book, and so I
will have to keep refreshing it.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.330
And, there are those buyers who look only
at this and buy.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.040
People don’t even come and see anything
else.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.849
There are these bestseller buyers.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:06.420
So, to appear here, takes a lot of push and
politics and money and… why?

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.620
Atoms take space and limited space is a problem.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.180
They can be music CDs, movie rentals, limited
space.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.400
Where did this phrase “The Long Tail”
originate from?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.840
Well, if you look at popularity versus the
number of unique products, there is this thing

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.930
called the Head.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.610
Hugely popular books, hugely popular products.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:42.569
Then there is the kind of popular / sort of
popular, here today, gone tomorrow, fashionable,

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.569
trendy….

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:55.180
And then, capable of extending all the way
till infinity, a very thin slice, low popularity,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.959
just like me, … that twenty-fourth book,
some guy in America had it closeted somewhere

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:02.959
in Idaho.

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.959
I paid more for shipping than for the cost
of the book.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.909
I had been such a maniacal collector!

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.841
So, there are very few people who love it,
but they would be ready to give an arm and

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:14.841
a leg for it!

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:19.050
There would be some who would say, “Take
my life if you want, but I need that thing!”

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:25.140
Goods that have this unique quality are said
to be in the Long Tail domain.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.420
You may remember Shark Tank.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.160
Do you know what is the best of the best on
Shark Tank?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.580
Among all the products that have become famous
because of Shark Tank?

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.760
What is the most unique, unusual, and maximum
money-making?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.130
You’ll be surprised!

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.440
It is a Long Tail product!

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.760
It is called Nerd Wax.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.100
That is, you have to be a male.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.740
You have to be a male who wears spectacles.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.590
You have to be a male who wears spectacles
and does work that typically draws sweat from

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:07.450
you, and you must be in the habit of pushing
the glasses with your finger up the bridge

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.790
of your nose!

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.660
If you are THAT Long Tail, that rarest of
the rare, they have a product for you.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.660
Magical product.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.920
If only you apply a thin film of this wax
on the sides of your nose where the spectacles

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.840
rest, whatever shake you do of your head,
however sweaty your face becomes, it won’t

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840
fall!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.810
So, those hardworking men, who wear glasses,
they would be ready to pay a premium to get

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.100
the product.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.940
And that’s how they made their money!

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.720
Think about Search Engines!

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.590
There are search engine keywords like “dog”.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.600
Whoever searches for “dog”, there will
be results.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.110
Many many results.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.140
Movies named “dog”, books named “dog”,
people who sell “dog”, what “dog”?

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.120
Indian dog breed?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.940
European dog breed?

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.490
And then, there would be people who would
search for “guard dog”…

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.830
That is a mildly more serious.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.380
But… if you really want to nail the answer,
if you want to get what you are looking for

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.070
in just the first page of Google Search, you
would do something like…

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.770
“best breed of guard dog for families with
children”.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.770
Wow!

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.580
What a beautiful long tail!

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.550
You are specifying it, you are narrowing it
down, to extreme specifics.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.990
There won’t be many results.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.730
But the one or two results that come, will
be simply amazing.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.690
Did you know Coursera hosts courses with such
unusual titles?

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.350
Simply because Coursera doesn’t need to
have a classroom and a teacher and limited

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.720
seats in a physical environment, there are
courses like these!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.400
A course called “The truth about cats and
dogs”.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.120
Another that is about Intellectual Humility
— the art of respecting the other person’s

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.169
opinions!

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.630
Long Tail.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.700
The blessing of The Long Tail is, you have
infinite storage, and you have instant search.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.760
And, this is the advice they give.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.440
So, dump it all out there.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.880
You have infinite shelf space after all.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.970
Lower the price drastically.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.510
And then, help me find it.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.040
Like I helped you just now by lowering my
head!

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.520
Make it easy for people to find it!

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.260
But, there is a little drawback hidden right
there too.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Don’t forget!

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.530
Till now, as long as we had limited shelf
space, consumers were like, “Let me just

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.740
look at what’s being bought by most other
people, and let me follow suit!”

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.000
But today, because of this infinite shelf
space, because everything is now available,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.160
the time has come for you to think through,
individually, about the decisions and choices

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.800
you need to make!

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.910
It is infinitely customisable to suit your
need, but do you know what you need?

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:06.280
Thank you!
