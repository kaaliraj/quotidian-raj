00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.029
This is Blaise Pascal.

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:05.029
French mathematician.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.029
Inventor.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.029
Scientist.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.029
Philosopher.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.030
Way back in the seventeenth century.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.840
He talked about something very beautiful,
very short.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:29.410
It seems he once said, “If I’d had more
time, I would’ve written a shorter letter!”

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.350
He says, he would have made it SHORTER!

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.329
There is something beautiful about this shortness.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.750
Brevity.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.090
Thirukkural, for example.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.880
Perhaps, I think, there is nothing shorter
and at the same time more profound, in this

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.329
world of literature, anywhere else!

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:15.110
It is about a short book like that, that we
are going to talk about today.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.960
Namaste!

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.710
Four hundred and forty five is about short
bits of advice.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.670
Specifically, it is about this book.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.500
Not even by a famous author, actually.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.140
I went searching and I couldn’t really locate
this man, online.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.390
We have struggled once like this, earlier
too!

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.119
Peter Atkins is the not-so-famous author of
this interesting book.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.009
The name of the book itself, attracted me
much.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.240
“Life is short, and so is this book”.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.320
Pretty short.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.600
Formed of twelve chapters.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.130
About life-lessons learned in the school of
hard knocks.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:08.330
He has put those life-lessons together, and
added some little tidbits from his own life,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.610
and famous quotes from some famous people,
and created this little book.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.500
We are going to have a fleeting tour of the
twelve chapters that can be found in this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500
book.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.470
The first advice is “Create Space”.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.349
We have encountered this earlier too.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.640
Give space.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.580
Give elbow room.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.879
Wiggle room.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.040
The classic example is that of a bottle.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:45.069
If a bottle, the fizz bottle, carbonated drink,
if it has to bubble out explosively, it is

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.580
not enough to have liquid.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.690
You need some space.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.349
Because, that is where the action is.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.500
The air — liquid contact membrane.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.320
That is where the action happens.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.370
So, give some space.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.909
Cut some slack.

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.170
Do not pour everything about you into whatever
you take up.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.760
Einstein himself — have you listened to
him play the violin?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760
It might sound unbearably jarring!

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.670
You may not be able to tolerate Einstein’s
violin.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.300
But, he tolerated it.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.360
His neighbours tolerated it.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.250
Thank God they did.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.269
Because, that is what gave him space.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.689
He has been thinking about a lot of very complicated
things.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:44.099
But, for all those pieces to fall in place,
you need to get away from it all, once in

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.569
a while.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.319
Create Space.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.049
Try not to worry!

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.890
There are too many things that are not in
your control.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.519
Do what you can, to the best of your ability.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:07.180
And, when it looks like you have no influence
over what’s going to happen, sit back and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.519
enjoy the show.

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.459
Watch it unfold in front of you.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.549
Do not worry.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.459
It is the rocking chair that comes to mind,
when I see the word “Worry”.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.790
Erma Bombeck once said, “Worry is like a
rocking chair: it gives you something to do,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.830
but it never gets you anywhere”.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.440
It lets you furiously move around, as if you
are ‘busy’, but it doesn’t get you anywhere.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.740
It only distracts you from being focused on
the job, and only complicates matters…

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.740
Remember?

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.740
The universe aligning itself?

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.720
Worries will only become obstacles and distractions
to the alignment that you are looking for

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.509
in the universe!

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.190
Try not to worry!

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.449
Don’t do dumb things!

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.470
There is even a book titled, “Why do smart
people do dumb things?!”

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.330
Unfortunately, smart people don’t read that
book!

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.400
A rule for everybody else.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.620
A special, different rule, exclusively for
me..!

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:08.100
That is the starting point of the mistake
too many people make!

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.389
They think they are special, they think they
are immortal, they think for them, things

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.910
will turn out differently.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.910
They think they are lucky.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.449
It could be a simple thing like identifying
an item via Google search, or it could be

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:29.270
something involved and complicated as investing
in a particular stock in the stock market.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.590
You have to realise that the dice are actually
loaded against you.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.980
The house always wins, like they say.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.320
You have to start looking at yourself as an
“average person”..

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.770
You could perhaps win.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.350
You could perhaps lose too.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.720
Only then will things start dawning on you.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.130
Too often, we think failure is the stepping
stone for success.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.340
Yes, but only if, after failing, you learn
the right lesson.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.889
Only if you internalise that the failure is
BECAUSE of this action, will you be headed

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:04.889
towards success.

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.820
Otherwise, you are going to go to the next,
even worse, failure.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.310
Building character and Making friends — are
two important qualities, says the author.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.090
We have already debated much about Nature
Versus Nurture.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.270
Is it because of birth?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.860
Or because of the environment?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.240
Too many people have now identified that it
is the environment you grow in that has a

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.949
much larger, much longer impact on you.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.430
Where you grow?

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.789
Who are your friends?

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.580
Who are your mentors?

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.130
Who influence you?

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.280
Who do you get influenced by?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.810
Who are you surrounding yourself with?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.810
Those questions…

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.680
Lock yourself up and think through them.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.759
Are you the smartest person in the room?

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.919
Remember that?

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.180
Do not be!

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.180
Do not be!

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.880
Avoid blindness, advises the author.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:11.240
Too often, we identify a mentor, we identify
a Guruji, and we start blindly following them.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.120
They are humans too.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.820
They too are probably fallible.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.000
They can make mistakes too.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.819
And, those mistakes can probably boomerang
on you..!

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:26.460
Have that in mind always!

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.660
Don’t follow anything blindly.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.879
And, admit your mistakes.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:36.000
If you make a mistake, “I have committed
a mistake, this is the lesson I have learned

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.979
from it” should be your next step.

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:43.780
That is when people will admire your authenticity
and be attracted to you.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.409
Those are the kinds of friends you need in
the first place.

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.740
So, admit your mistakes.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.050
Take care of yourself, and take care of others.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:59.560
In fact, the ultimate level of taking care
of yourself, is taking care of others.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.300
And, while talking about taking care of the
self, the author stresses much on the importance

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.669
of good sleep.

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:08.319
Are you sleeping enough?

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:11.620
Some say six, some say seven, some say nine
hours.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.789
But, are you sleeping enough?

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:19.550
I watched a TED talk recently, it is a very
short one, I watched it just before going

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:27.139
to sleep, .. and the doctor, the lady doctor
comes over and says, “Here are three questions.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:31.440
Ask yourself what the answer is to these three.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.070
That will determine whether you are sleeping
enough..

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.580
1 — Are you reasonably well-rested through
the day?

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.940
2 — Are you sleeping through disturbances,
at night?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:54.770
Or, does a single pin-drop affect your sleep
from that moment on?

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.500
3 — Do you stay awake through the day?

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.040
Or do you drop off randomly, without control,
at your desk?

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:10.180
If your answer to these three questions are
Yes, Yes, and a resounding Yes, then, don’t

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.980
worry about anything else, you are sleeping
enough, she says.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.490
The reason she is bringing these to the fore
is a new disease called Orthosomnia!

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.490
We have heard of insomnia, but what’s this
orthosomnia?

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:31.270
Everybody now has a watch tracker on their
wrists.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.600
REM sleep they say.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.690
Deep sleep.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.860
Dreamy sleep.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.860
Disturbed sleep.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.900
Number of hours..

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.900
Number of…

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.760
This tracking all the way to hell and back?

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.670
That itself will affect the quality of your
sleep, she says!

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:50.950
The act of measuring is eating into the quality
of your sleep.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.920
Orthosomnia.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.890
Beware!

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.459
He talks about happiness.

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:58.180
Keep laughing!

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.280
That is the only thing really in your control!

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.269
Don’t think it is not in your control!

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:10.310
He also elaborates further, with a beautiful
experiment researchers conducted many years

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.310
ago.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.740
They analysed lottery winners.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:20.240
How happy they were before the win.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240
Some sort of average.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.300
What happened after the lottery was announced?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.500
Skyhigh levels!

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.460
After that, the researchers go back to these
winners..

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.020
Eight / Ten months later.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.399
And they notice that it has gone back to their
average.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:38.980
A lottery has not affected long term happiness…

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.730
At least this is perhaps understandable.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.210
But, look at the second half of their experiment!

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.210
A counter-experiment.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.490
In that, they look at people who have become
paralysed.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.370
Perhaps because of an accident.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.250
Or because of a disease.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:59.310
And, when paralysis hits them, their happiness
hits rockbottom.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.310
Understandably.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:08.670
But… a similar amount of time later, they
go back and trace the same paralysed people,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.060
and check their happiness level.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.440
Guess what?!

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.060
It has gone back to their pre-paralysis average!!

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:25.450
So, irrespective of whether you win the lottery
or lose mobility because of paralysis, what

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:30.850
matters seems to be your inner make up.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.350
What are you made of?

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.410
What’s your mindset?

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.290
That mindset is the long term average.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.690
So, work on your mind set.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.589
You don’t have control about the lottery,
or about the paralytic attack.

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:52.000
But you have control over your mindset, and
that’s what matters, says the author, with

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.810
this beautiful example.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.070
And then he paints this picture.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.589
An island.

00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:00.850
Sun.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.110
Surf.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.370
Sand.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.810
Margarita in hand.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:10.420
For too many people, idiotic people, this
is the vision that comes to mind when asked

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.700
“What is your dream destination?”

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:23.449
or “What do you want to be doing in life,
long term?” says Jordan Peterson, author

00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:28.329
of 12 Rules for Life.

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:31.820
He calls it the “Lie of your Life”.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:38.080
Hey, do you think you can stand this one day?

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.080
Two days?

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.209
One week?

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:43.290
You will start vomiting at the thought of
the margarita.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.920
That’s how bad things can become.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.820
This is not your goal.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.260
Your goal can’t be unadulterated continuous
enjoyment.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.589
It will cease to be enjoyment.

00:12:56.589 --> 00:13:00.120
You will want to go back to some meaningful
work.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:06.940
And, that is what is explained in the Duck
Book quite beautifully.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:12.529
The author says, “Please understand, you
have to give a duck!

00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:15.589
Don’t think you don’t need to.

00:13:15.589 --> 00:13:17.280
Don’t think you can escaping having to.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.850
You have to give a duck.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.730
But, what are you going to give it on?

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.130
How much?

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.130
For what?

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.130
That is what is in your hands.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.320
And, you decide that with great care.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.399
Give it a lot of attention.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:36.260
Choosing what you want to give a duck for…

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.040
This is what the author says.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.040
The key to a good life is not giving a duck
about more.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.769
It is giving a duck about less.

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:50.250
Giving a duck about only what is true and
immediate and important.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.490
So, choose the pain!

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.560
Not happiness!

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:01.880
Choose the pain that you are ready to tolerate,
that you are ready to probably even enjoy!

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.070
There lies the key to happiness.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.170
Embracing change!

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:11.800
This is something we have talked enough about.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.670
The author brings the example of the surfer.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.329
Look at the surfer.

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:21.329
He fails repeatedly.

00:14:21.329 --> 00:14:22.329
Here, it is a she.

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:24.279
She fails repeatedly.

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.440
Again and again.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.959
But, does it matter?

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:33.070
It doesn’t because she is looking for that
one wave.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.329
She is waiting for it.

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:37.540
She is waiting for that right moment.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.540
And, she can’t wait forever either.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:48.040
If she doesn’t act at that exact moment
when the crest appears, it will topple her

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040
over.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.100
But, if she catches it at the right moment,
bliss!

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.320
She will be taken..

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.779
She will be queen, for the next ten / fifteen
seconds.

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:06.300
Riding at the crest of the wave for everybody
to see.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.840
You have to be ready for that special moment.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.449
And, remember, this is going to die down.

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:17.790
If you want to continue flying, you will have
to be ready to catch the next one when it

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.630
is about to form.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:25.230
Curve-jumping, we had read about a while ago.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:30.170
Curve-jumping is a very important lesson we
learn from the Surfer.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.170
Embrace change.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:37.709
You can either be ready for change, … or,
you can be the agent of change.

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:40.600
Be the agent of change.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.339
Bring about change.

00:15:42.339 --> 00:15:43.759
Think about that.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:48.329
Learning from experience — we have all learned
this enough.

00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:55.110
We understand that we don’t have time in
this life to really live through all its experiences

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.250
ourselves.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.670
We need to use curiosity, sometimes.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.199
We could read books and learn, sometimes.

00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:06.529
We could identify a good Guruji and continue
our learning.

00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:12.470
We could observe the mistakes others do, and
we can learn.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.110
Data and Patterns..

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.290
Observing, analysing, drawing insights…

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.680
This is a skill they didn’t teach us at
school.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.139
Statistics used to be one of the last chapters
in mathematics at school.

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:38.589
Close to the exam, the maths teacher will
advise us to skip the chapter and focus on

00:16:38.589 --> 00:16:40.310
the rest of it, instead.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.440
Today, statistics is even more important.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.460
Somehow, the teacher didn’t touch upon.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:51.220
I wish we all understand Data Science, the
old wine in new bottle..

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:58.510
We all need to understand a little bit of
this science of analysing and identifying

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.490
insights from data.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:07.549
Mark Twain is supposed to have said, “History
never repeats itself, but it does rhyme!”

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:09.780
What is he trying to say?

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.980
Well, he is saying, if something like this
happens once, it won’t necessarily happen

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.980
again..

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:22.260
But, when you abstract it one level up, you
will realise that the same thing is happening,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.520
only slightly differently.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.189
It doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:33.299
So, keep watching and learn from history.

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:40.510
Otherwise you are doomed to suffer, beware!

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.850
Having Dreams — that is the last advice
he gives in this book — and, working for

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.850
them.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:53.390
When we travel towards a goal, we think we
run sprints.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:18:01.380
We have identified some goal to go towards,
and we go whole hog, all guns blazing, or

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.520
that is what we all think.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.320
That is the worst way to start towards a goal,
says the author.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.790
Remember the Atomic Habits?

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.710
If you want to run a marathon…

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.490
any meaningful goal is a marathon by the way,
nothing is easy, nothing is short term, … if

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:22.200
you want to run a marathon, you don’t start
with your fastest speed.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.860
You start walking.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.400
You practice walking.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.660
You practice keeping up your pace for long
durations.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.770
And then you slowly increase.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.470
And then you get competitive.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.620
That’s how you work towards a goal.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:49.950
Yuval Noah Harari, in his famous book Sapiens,
he talks about any goal achieved by anybody

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:59.169
being not achieved by that person or by his
family or friends, but by humanity itself.

00:18:59.169 --> 00:19:01.850
By the species homo sapiens itself.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:07.090
Only because somebody some day long ago invented
something, the other guy has been able to

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:11.740
do this, this other lady has been able to
do that, and then, along history, somebody

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.860
invented the Printing Press, and then somebody
brought up… that is how the author builds

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.860
the chain.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.090
If you are doing something, it is built on…

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.940
Newton said that, didn’t he?

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:26.289
“I am able to see farther because I am standing
on the shouder of giants”.

00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:29.230
Please retain that respect.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.500
Whatever you do, it is little…

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.780
It has to be slow.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:32.780
Move forward.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.940
It has to be slow.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:43.250
It has to be lifelong.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.090
As a closing thought, I wanted to go back
to the title of the book itself.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.260
Life is short..

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.800
Life is short..

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.390
Is Life Short?

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.390
Really?

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.570
Is it not enough really?

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:03.289
Paul Graham, the famous Silicon Valley entrepreneur,
thinker, philosopher, has written an article

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:06.450
on this very subject..

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.419
Yes, Life is indeed short.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:20.140
It is just one moment when you miss your baby
standing up for the first time.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.940
Won’t happen again.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.660
It is just twelve months when your baby is
a toddler.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.120
Learning to speak.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:36.530
It is probably just six times you will decorate
your Christmas tree, with your child really

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.360
believing that it is Santa Claus coming in
through the chimney.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:50.970
It is probably four more times before you
are no longer able to talk to your grandma.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.830
Think about it.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.070
Consider it.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.929
Talk about it.

00:20:55.929 --> 00:20:57.559
Life is short..

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:59.120
Do not waste time..

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:05.320
Steve Jobs famously said, “Do not waste
it living somebody else’s plan for you”.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.890
This person, Paul Graham, introduces a Bullshit
meter.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:16.990
Have this bullshit filter set up around you.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:23.419
Do not waste time on these things, he says,
and throws a list at us.

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:25.919
Unnecessary meetings.

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:29.440
Worthless conflicts.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.190
Bureaucracy.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.950
Paperwork.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.710
Permissions.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.240
Going up the chain in the hierarchy.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.299
Asking for permissions.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.200
And wondering what to do..

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.360
Don’t waste time in all this.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.840
Stop acting for the sake of others, stop putting
up a show!

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.980
Stop fixing mistakes committed by other people.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.020
He even mentions the infamous traffic jam.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.760
I think it is important.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.200
Live close to where you work.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.659
Work close to where you live.

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:04.130
It is a special kind of bliss.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:10.090
It gives you… 27 hours in a day!

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.890
Think about it!

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:20.090
And, … he touches upon hobbies and their
addictive impact on lifestyles.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.669
Yes, have a hobby.

00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:24.750
Yes, allow yourself to create space.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:33.610
But, unrewarding and pointless hobbies should
be avoided at all costs.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:43.260
So, this is going to help you probably lengthen
the short life that you and I are living.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.260
Think about it.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.890
Don’t waste time.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:53.240
We will meet you soon.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.740
Thank you!
