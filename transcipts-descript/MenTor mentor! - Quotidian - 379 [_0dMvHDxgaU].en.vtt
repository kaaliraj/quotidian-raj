00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:09.440
This Zoho logo… How many times we must have
seen it?! Do you remember if it is this…

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:18.270
or this… or this…?&nbsp;
Talking about philosophers… If we say the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.370
word "philosophy", we are only reminded of
these three people, more often than not. I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:35.129
am sure you remember their names. There was
Aristotle. There was Socrates. And, there

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:46.320
was Plato. Who came first? Do you know?!
Namaste!

00:00:46.320 --> 00:01:10.360
A guide for life! Always, somebody there to
guide us, help us, to show the way! We saw

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.420
those three people, didn't we?! All three
of them were Athenians! Imagine, they lived

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.070
during the same time, they knew each other
very well, they were students of the previous

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.040
person. If there was Socrates in the beginning,
he had created an amazing academic institution

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.190
for philosophy, and Plato was a student in
that. And, Aristotle arrived as Plato's student!

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:48.670
In the whole wide world, one little city called
Athens, two thousand five hundred years ago,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.190
three people, almost at the same time! How
special! That relationship between the teacher

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:05.440
and the student! What a lofty pair!&nbsp;
"Have you seen God" - "Have you seen God" - "Can

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.880
you show me God" - this was the question
he went around asking everybody he met - Narendra,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.190
soon to become famous as Swami Vivekananda.
He wanted to know if there was somebody who

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.810
had seen God, who had experienced God, he
wanted to learn from that person. He travelled

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.840
far and wide. Finally, somebody pointed him
towards Sri Ramakrishna. He went and he asked

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.800
the same question. "Have you seen God" - Yes,
came the instant answer from Sri Ramakrishna!

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:53.760
It was a shock! He said, "I am, and that is
enough proof that there is God". I am existing.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.890
And, the reason for my existence itself, is
the existence of a concept called God!" That

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.430
was the beginning of a beautiful relationship.
If you step over to Hindu mythology, there

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.150
is this beautiful relationship between the
Sun God… Technically, the person who knows

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.690
everything, because in the geocentric world,
he is a person who circumnavigates the globe

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.310
once every day! There is nothing that he doesn't
know, really! He knows, he observes, he analyses,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.430
he tracks everything). It would so happen
that the Sun God would give a boon to the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.330
lucky little monkey - our Hanuman - "I
will be your mentor. I will be your teacher!"

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.959
And, dutifully, Hanuman would jump up into
the sky one fine day, and ask the Sun God

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:56.260
"You had promised me to teach me. I am here!",
and the Sun God would say, "Yes, but I have

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.459
this work. I have to go around Earth once
every twenty-four hours, what are you going

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.380
to do!" To which, Hanuman would reply, "No
problem! I see that you have a seven-horsed

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.250
chariot! I will fly backwards! A few feet
in front of the chariot! You mind your business!

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.070
I will learn by observing you! I will learn
in those few moments of rest that you get!

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:30.509
You can teach me! Continue with your work!
I will learn by working with you! I will bend.

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:37.800
I will change my attitude. I will change the
way I do things. I will fly backwards!"

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.710
Do you remember the story of Troy?! A very
beautiful princess is abducted. And, to get

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.340
the princess back where she is supposed to
be, a huge armada of thousands of ships gets

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.750
going, and Ulysses is one of the heroes of
that big big war… a huge horse made of wood…

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.930
People inside the horse… They open the gates
for the invaders… And the unbeatable fortress

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:13.990
of Troy is destroyed! But, in this story,
there is a warrior who never took part in

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:23.380
the whole of this war! The name of that warrior?
Telemachus! Meaning, "Far from the battle",

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:33.030
literally! How sneakily has Homer woven the
story!! A person far from the battle, a person

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.449
who never took part in the war, but stayed
elsewhere! The Son of Ulysses! When starting

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.310
on his journey, not having any idea how long
this was going to take, (He really didn't

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:52.990
know! He fought for ten years, and then struggled
to return, struggled a lot, for ten more years!

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:03.190
Twenty years! All through the childhood of
Telemachus, he was not with his son. The father

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.290
was not with his son. Fearing that something
like this should happen, the Dad appoints

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:16.680
one of his friends, one of his respected friends:
"Please take care of this boy. Teach him how

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:25.320
to do politics, how to work with people, how
to fight, how to not fight, teach him everything!".

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:35.181
And, his name? Mentor! The original mentor,
M in Capital! He was a human being. Was a

00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:44.250
guide. Was a guru. The person who taught everything
to Telemachus. To honour that amazing contribution

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:51.250
he made, the English dictionary borrowed his
name and added it as a word! Mentor! To guide,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:59.389
to show the way, to be the guiding lamp, or
the lighthouse, that helps you avoid trouble!

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:07.270
If you were to pick a pair from more recent
times, you may want to consider Maya Angelou

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:15.510
and Oprah Winfrey. Oprah Winfrey, we all know,
probably the single richest billionaire black

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:22.570
woman in the world! She has struggled a lot.
She has suffered a lot. A troubled childhood.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:31.259
And, along the way, she meets Maya Angelou.
A poetess. A civil rights activist. Learns

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:38.199
a lot from her. Primarily, she says, "Maya
is the person who taught me how to work with

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:44.699
people. What is trust? What is belief? What
is faith? How to accept people for who they

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:49.460
are, without second-guessing them - it
was Maya who taught me that lesson." Again,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:08:02.770
a beautiful mentoring relationship.&nbsp;
Why do we need mentors? In my opinion, if

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:09.750
you want to do something special, if you want
to be, not just good, but want to be great,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:16.410
you will have to take the road less traveled.
If you are going to go on the same path that

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:23.169
everybody else has traveled, yes, you can
probably join a Kota class like this, and

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:29.289
learn like everybody else is learning. But,
if you are going to go off the beaten path…,&nbsp;

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:38.409
…you need somebody who will be specially,
in a dedicated manner, working just with you,

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:45.529
one on one. They would have already committed
the errors you were going to make! The questions

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:49.420
that would soon be occurring to you, they
might have already answered for themselves.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.920
And, hey… you may wonder, why do I need
a "person", to get my questions answered…

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.610
Correct.. Don't we have the internet? Don't
we have Youtube? Isn't that enough? Well,

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:08.189
yes! But, turn that around for a moment. Who
is going to ASK you questions? Will Google

00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:14.119
ASK you questions? Google only knows how to
answer all the amazing questions you ask.

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:21.850
On the other hand, the mentor torments you!
All the times when you are awake, also the

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:26.129
times when you are are sleeping even, they're
going to haunt your dreams, they're going

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:31.880
to give you sleepless nights. They're going
to challenge you. They're going to ask you.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:38.220
They're going to test you. They're going to
push you to the limits of your endurance.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.970
Because…? They are invested in seeing you
grow. They have made a commitment, they have

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.819
shown interest, and want and wish that you
actually grow. That's when they take up a

00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:55.149
mentoring relationship with you. If they are
going to accept you as a mentee, they must

00:09:55.149 --> 00:10:01.910
be invested in the idea, that yes, here is
a seed that can grow. There is potential.&nbsp;

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:13.290
In this book, Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of
Facebook, has done a lot of good to the women

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:19.421
community. But, if you don't look at this
book as one written for women, but as one

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:24.670
written for people wanting to grow, people
in the process of growing, then, there are

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:32.610
a lot of good takeaways for everyone of us
in this book. Specifically, she has a chapter

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:39.290
on mentoring.
And in that, she says, I am bored, I am really

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:46.230
upset, when somebody meets me, says hi, introduces
themselves, and immediately they start asking

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:56.929
me, "Will you be my mentor". It is a really
bad question! Wrong! It is, she says, equivalent

00:10:56.929 --> 00:11:03.790
to some stranger coming, shaking your hands,
and popping this question to you, "Will you

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:12.740
marry me!" No way, that's not how a relationship
is created, it has to be harvested only after

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:19.721
it is cultivated for a long time. So, how
do you cultivate such a relationship? She

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:26.220
gives four or five pointers.
Primarily, she says, please stop believing

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:36.629
in this Sleeping Beauty story. Remember that
story? A lady sleeping inside a glass casket,

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:42.379
holding on to a red rose, many years pass
by, Prince Charming came on horseback, kissed

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:50.559
her, took her away! That is NOT going to happen.
A mentor is NOT going to come if you just

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:57.290
don't do anything, if you just keep waiting.
You have to do a few things. What are they?

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:05.379
Number 1! First, know what you want. Why are
you looking for a mentor? What is the gap

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:11.399
you want to fill? What is the bridge you want
to build? What is that chasm you want to cross?

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:21.339
First, find out what is the problem you are
fighting. That self-introspection is needed.

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:28.199
Then, you need to be able to manage your time
well. Remember that Hanuman story? Flying

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:36.269
backwards! What an example! I will bend over
backwards. I will do anything you want. Just

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:40.959
take me as your mentor.. I will help you.
I will work with you. I will do your work.

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:46.929
In those days, during Gurukulam, ninety percent
of the time, the student would be washing

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:53.279
the teacher's feet, taking care of the cows
and the cattle belonging to the Guru, probably

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:59.459
doing vegetable gardening for the Guru Mata
or the Guru Patni, that is how it started.

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:07.240
So, be able to take care of your time well,
manage it very well, you must be an asset

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:15.839
to the person you are taking as a mentor.&nbsp;
The third thing is, Give before you even think

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:25.661
of Taking. Many many years, people stay in
the apprenticeship mode. I am a student. I

00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:31.430
observe, I watch, I learn, along the way,
there is something that is beneficial that

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:37.870
gets in. That can happen later. But right
now, I need to cultivate the mentor-mentee

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:44.410
relationship. And, I am here to provide support.
I am here to be the Executive Assistant, to

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:50.499
this great man, to this great woman. That
is the way you have to see it. Give long before

00:13:50.499 --> 00:13:57.249
you even think of Taking.
And, finally, many of us make this mistake.

00:13:57.249 --> 00:14:04.769
We end up not being coachable at all. What
is this "Coachability"? Will you accept if

00:14:04.769 --> 00:14:09.869
given feedback? It is not about taking feedback
in the right spirit. That is the first level.

00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:16.319
But, the second level is, do you know how
to incorporate feedback? When meaningful feedback

00:14:16.319 --> 00:14:24.560
and criticism come to you, do you know how
to work in your system? Fix those little things?

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.810
So that the feedback that comes the next time
is different? Coachability! You can't have

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:34.910
an ego, if you want to be coachable! You need
to have very good self-understanding! That

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:43.170
is when you are coachable! And, that is when
this mentor-mentee relationship will blossom.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:50.329
Finally, she says that we should stop saying,
"If only I had a mentor, I would have excelled".

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:57.059
We should stop that! Why? That is because,
if only you excelled in whatever you were

00:14:57.059 --> 00:15:02.670
doing, the mentor would appear automatically!
When the student is ready, the teacher appears!

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:09.649
Remember, we have seen it earlier too? What
is the meaning of that? The mentor is waiting.

00:15:09.649 --> 00:15:18.730
For that amazing next-generation entity. So
that he or she can pour the remainder of their

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:25.239
lives and leave a legacy.&nbsp;
That is the legacy we are seeing here too.

00:15:25.239 --> 00:15:31.429
Mentors need proteges too! Remember Lydian
Nadhaswaram. Winner of the one million dollar

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:39.990
prize. Teenage boy wonder. Child prodigy.
Recently, he became the first and probably

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:50.199
the one and only student of the great Ilaiyaraaja!
Something in the boy must have turned something

00:15:50.199 --> 00:16:00.809
on in that amazing brain of Mr. Ilaiyaraaja - the
Maestro. And so, he volunteered, "Hey, I want

00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:09.370
to take you as a student!" Isn't that amazing?!&nbsp;
As a closing thought, I just wanted to close

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:16.139
the loop of what we started in the beginning.
Which of these is the correct logo of Zoho?

00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:26.139
There is a simple trick, folks! Remember this
game? Rugby? R U G B Y, yes? Red, Green, Blue,

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:34.049
Yellow! That is the correct order! Everything
else is wrong! Similarly, I had asked who

00:16:34.049 --> 00:16:41.639
had come first! Plato? Aristotle? Socrates?
Very simple trick again! Remember the spa?

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:48.529
A place where they let you lie down, pour
water on you, massage you with oil, imagine

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:55.589
these three people provided you a spa! A spa
for the brain! They gave it that massage!

00:16:55.589 --> 00:17:03.430
SPA! Socrates! Plato! Aristotle! That is the
order in which they appear!&nbsp;

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.809
Thank you then! We will meet again on the
18th!
