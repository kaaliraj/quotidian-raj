00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:09.380
In the late 80s and the early 90s, … we
used to get a very famous daily comic strip

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.500
called Calvin and Hobbes.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.929
We used to think it was for children, but
actually it was heavy.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:18.980
Philosophical.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.029
Profound.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.140
Calvin was the little boy..

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.779
And Hobbes was the … stuffed tiger (pssst…!

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.769
The tiger will get angry if it hears this!)

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.119
See what’s happening in this strip!

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.760
Calvin is waiting for inspiration.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.090
He has to finish a big project..

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.160
“Haven’t you started it yet?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.320
You are still playing!” asks Hobbes.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.559
Calvin says, “Hey, no, I am waiting for
inspiration.

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.989
You can’t just turn on creativity like a
faucet!

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.579
You have to be in the right mood!”

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.579
And Hobbes persists..

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.420
He wants to know what MOOD Calvin is referring
to.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.780
And Calvin replies, “Last Minute Panic!”

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.729
Many times, we interact with children, we
interact with teammates, and looks like there

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.700
are quite a lot of similarities between them
both.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:37.170
That’s what we are going to look at today!

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.000
Namaste!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.310
Four hundred and twenty four!

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.530
We have called it “Siruvar Merppaarvai”..

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.360
Managing Kids.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.810
But, looks like there is a beautiful lesson
waiting for us right there!

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.740
The thing is, I came across three different
books.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.170
The first one was titled, … a very long
one…

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.100
“How To Talk So Kids Will Listen And Listen
So Kids Will Talk!”

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.240
How to talk, and how to listen when they are
talking!

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.690
And then, I saw two other books.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:32.890
One by a software engineer, techie turned
into a Software Project Manager..

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.000
Titled “Leading Snowflakes”.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.940
The other, by a lady who was a techie, who
turned into a Project Manager.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.190
Titled “Glue”.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.870
Do you get the double meaning loaded in “Leading
Snowflakes”?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.870
Leading snowflakes…

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.320
Also, snowflakes that are leading..

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.260
By the way, why have they used the word “Snowflakes”?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.450
Well, each is unique!

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.540
Each has a perfect shape, but, like no other.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.310
That is why, they have called it “Leading
Snowflakes”.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.650
So, when I saw these three books together,
I realised, probably, there are quite a few

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:36.320
lessons that one can get from the first book,
and see probably an analogy, a mirror image,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.030
in the next two books.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.700
I will give you some examples.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.900
The first advice with respect to children
is, “Acknowledge, Accept, and if possible,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900
Address!”

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.650
Is there a problem?

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.530
Acknowledge that there is a problem first.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.720
Accept that the problem may never ever go
away.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.010
And then, after that, think about how to fix
the problem…

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.900
A kid’s lunchbox.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.790
Looks so attractive.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.790
Alluring.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.930
Such an amazing lunch!

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.930
Fruit.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.930
Corn.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.930
Golden-toasted bread.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.930
Nuts.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.930
The child kept crying.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.409
Only much later, after sitting with the child
for a considerable amount of time, after observing

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.919
how the child went about eating from the lunchbox,
only then we realised that they haven’t

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.669
kept the right number of pistas..

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:45.099
I will eat one almond, followed by two pistas.

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:51.530
Followed again by one almond and again two
pistas.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.530
Silly??

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.949
But, that’s such an emotional moment for
the child.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.860
Exactly the same way, I have observed the
snowflake-quality in some of my colleagues.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.860
I have a friend..

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.009
A colleague.

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.220
I don’t want to mention his name, obviously.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.870
Anytime you see him, he will be wearing headphones.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:20.120
Morning, first thing in the day, Monday morning,
when he is “supposed to be at work”, he

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.090
will be engrossed in something, with his headphones
on.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.310
He is a die-hard Ilaiyaraja fan too, and unfortunately,
I knew that!

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.360
So, I used to, … in the deep dark corner
of my mind, I used to feel bad.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.830
He is such a senior person, he is setting
a bad example.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.449
Why can’t he focus a bit more, why can’t
he really do meaningful work, … Why does

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.310
he need that blasted music?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.169
Is it really that important?

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.169
Monday morning!

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.639
But, one day, he had just kept his headphones
off and had stepped out.. and wanting to know

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.100
what exactly was the ‘blasted music’ he
was listening to, I check his open applications,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.529
hang the headphones over my ears to hear what
music is streaming, … utter silence!

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.639
Pin drop silence!

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:10.590
That’s when I learned that he was actually
shutting out the noise from around him!

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.159
He wasn’t playing music, he was trying to
get calm!

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.190
Idiosyncrasies, they call it.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.240
Each person has his / her own red button.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.029
Some hot button.

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:28.490
That ticks them off.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.090
Acknowledge.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.699
Accept.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.699
Try to address.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.169
Here is another example.

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:42.510
The first thing you are supposed to do to
a child is to verbalise to it what the perceived

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.510
problem is.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.510
Verbalise!

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.510
“Why did you spill the food all over?

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.220
Will you ever do it again?”

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.939
One can shout at it.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:54.669
The noodles is splattered all over the place!

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:04.009
Would you do that, or would you take the approach
of the smart mom who says, … “I have to

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:09.840
spend a lot of time cleaning all this.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.560
You have made a mess of the whole thing.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560
It has spilled all over the floor.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.840
There are going to be ants, if I don’t clean
up after you..!”

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.840
Verbalise!

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.030
Probably the child doesn’t understand.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:27.539
Probably, if the child understood, the child
might empathise.

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:28.740
That same thing..

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.080
That disconnected, disengaged employee..

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.259
You are talking to her.

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:40.159
But, she is just wondering idly when you would
leave her alone, when she can get back to

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.159
her joblessness…

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:44.159
Would you just continue prating?

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:51.229
Or, would you take the effort to convey what
would happen if she continues like this!?

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:55.289
What would happen to her, what would happen
to you, what would happen to the team, to

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:57.319
the company, … Verbalise!

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:00.819
For both of them.

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:01.819
For the child.

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:04.129
And for your colleagues.

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:06.979
How about this one.

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:10.150
Listen till the end!

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.740
The best thing you can give to a child, they
say, is TIME!

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.099
That TIME!

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:21.150
When the child is recounting to you, “Guess
what happened…?”

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.210
Can you listen till the end?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.110
Without crushing that enthusiasm into pieces..

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.210
Probably the child is telling about a horror
story that happened at school.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.210
Or..

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:37.190
Probably the child is telling about a running
race she came FOURTH in..

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.700
But, can you give them the time?

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:48.310
Without puncturing their enthusiasm, can you
help improve the situation?

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:54.530
It is the same thing in an employee-employer
relationship too..

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.630
A team manager, coming for a review is already
running late for the next meeting..

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:07.850
But, that guy, who has come up with that amazing
idea.. wants to tell you about the greatest

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:14.900
thing he has invented.. and he takes you to
a side, and shows you some beautiful flowcharts..

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.900
Observe keenly, look at that guy’s face..

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.590
The bespectacled person is explaining with
all gusto.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.680
The other guy, the shaved-head.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.720
Aren’t you able to almost hear him say,
“I wonder when you are going to stop this..

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.070
I have already decided this is a bad idea.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.970
Can we just move on?”

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:40.390
But, at least he is attentively, seemingly
attentively, listening.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.600
Listen till the end!

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.660
Okay, what about decision-making?

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.290
There is this kid..

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:55.160
When we try to force-feed him spinach, … The
kid feels, “No!

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.040
Because I feel I am being forced.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.320
Just because I am small, just because I am
weak, just because I live in your house, just

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.570
because I am not earning my living, …? Will
you force-feed me?”

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.140
On the other hand, what do smart dads do?

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.510
What do smart moms do?

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:20.880
“Would you want tomato sauce or mayonnaise
with this?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.890
Do you want to eat it in the morning, or in
the evening?

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.890
You decide!

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.990
You decide!

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.990
Autonomy!

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.260
You are the decision-maker!

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.300
Do you want me to golden-fry it or do you
want me to just boil it?

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.960
You decide!”

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.410
Look at this woman.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.410
She is a colleague.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.150
And, why is she so happy?

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.490
You know what happened?

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:56.300
We gave her the option, “You can actually
work on Monday or Wednesday or Friday, from

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.300
home!”

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:03.200
She has been asked to come to office the rest
of the days!

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:10.190
We are creating a scenario, a perception,
that she is being given autonomy…!

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.560
Do you get me?

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.560
Catch my point?

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.270
Is it done yet?

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.530
Are we there yet?

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.510
— Is a question children always ask.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:29.430
The converse is also true.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.920
When will you come back home, my dear?

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:42.880
I was watching a “junk series” on Netflix,
titled “Never Have I Ever”! Devi is her

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880
name.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.050
Her mom is Indian-born, America-settled.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:53.550
She is off to her friend’s place, and the
mom asks, out of a growing concern..

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.780
Of course she doesn’t like the question.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.220
And, what does she say?

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.730
I don’t know when I will come back!

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.800
I am going for a party.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800
WAIT.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:12.020
Let us look at the corporate scenario.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.730
Meet my boss!

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:20.880
One thing he has never done is … Be it an
idea that we have proposed, or a prototype

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880
that has been planned..

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.920
He has never put undue pressure on us with
a “When will it be ready!??”

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.990
He knows creativity doesn’t follow a timeline.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.830
It happens in starts.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.260
In bursts.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.620
It happens in its own time.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.570
But, he runs a business.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.130
And he needs that big picture…

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.560
And, the thing that I learned from him?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.590
For when I manage MY team?

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:52.920
It is the same thing that is talked about
in the Glue book!

00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:01.780
For both of these, for the mom who is managing
Devi, and for managers like me who is managing

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.910
a team of people, the suggestion is just this.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.930
Dig a little deeper.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.390
So, the typical answer to both questions,
“When will it be ready?”

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:20.769
and “When will you come back?” is “I
don’t know!”

00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:28.340
And so, the mother, or the project manager,
is supposed to very respectfully ask, “When

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.140
will you know…

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.910
When will you know when you will be able to
come back home!?”

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:44.840
“When will you know enough for you to give
me an estimate of this project’s timeline?!”

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.930
Simple, so effective.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.130
We have talked about appreciation.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.130
If there is a child involved, there is a performance
involved.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:14:00.580
And, if there is a performance involved, there
has to be an appreciation involved!

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.620
If the child wins, we appreciate…

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.390
But, if it loses?

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.160
Well, not so much!

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.640
Remember the mindset lady?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.640
Carol Dweck?

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:16.880
She asks us to appreciate the process, and
not the outcome.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.740
Did you put in a great effort?

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.810
Let me appreciate that!

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.270
Did you win something?

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.420
Okay, good, the process was good.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.430
That is why you won!

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.720
And, how should we appreciate the wins?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.120
NOT “Smart boy!”

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.530
But, “Great effort!”

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.500
Appreciate the effort.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.610
That’s what Steve Jobs did too.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.800
He didn’t appreciate only the people who
delivered those amazing products that were

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800
great successes..

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:58.460
And, he didn’t ignore the people who delivered
duds like this one!

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.900
This is called the Sunflower Mac.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.380
Have you even seen it?

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.380
Probably not.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.140
For, it is SUCH A BOMB.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.690
It just vanished without a trace.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.560
But, it was supposed to be fashioned over
a sunflower.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.280
You can swivel it in any direction.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.880
Who designed it?

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.380
Jony Ive.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:26.150
The same great designer who designed the iPhone,
the iPad, and who had a big role to play in

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.190
the Apple Watch.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:34.070
He was the guy who invented the Mac, designed
the looks.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:39.610
Even when Jony designed this contraption,
Steve Jobs fell in love with the design, appreciated

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.410
the design.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.720
Effort.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.780
Much more important than the outcome.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.530
For the kids, as well as for Mr. Jony Ive.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.180
If a thing ended happily, we reward usually.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.180
What reward?

00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:02.660
If you get the first rank at school, I will
take you to watch a movie, …? That is a

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.850
cheap reward.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.690
Guess what my dad did?

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.480
He introduced me to this book..!

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.980
He asked me to read the book start to end,
… he promised me gifts if I answered his

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.980
questions correctly!

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.150
And, I did just that..

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.900
Pored through the pages.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.610
Five hundred questions.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.430
Questions about the stars, the animals, air,
water, earth…

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.140
After I finished the books?

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.410
What was the reward?

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.380
I remember doing it during the summer vacation.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.360
What was the reward?

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.260
He gave me the next book in the series!

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:47.500
More tell me why, lots more tell me why, still
more tell me why, big book of tell me why,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.840
… This is what he did!

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.140
I didn’t realise it then, but now, I understand..

00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:06.269
What he did was he took away extrinsic motivation
and brought out the intrinsic motivation from

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:07.269
inside me.

00:17:07.269 --> 00:17:11.199
That’s what this guy Tom Sachs says.

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:15.759
He is a sculptor, he is an artist, he is a
designer who lives in New York.

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:17.490
This is what he says.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.679
The reward for good work?

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.889
What do you think it is?

00:17:21.889 --> 00:17:23.350
It is MORE WORK!

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:29.100
That is the reward, that is the right reward,
for good work.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:35.210
In the nineties, there was a movie called
“Gentleman”.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.129
In this movie, there is a specific scene…

00:17:40.129 --> 00:17:45.240
A policeman is on the hunt, for our Arjun.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:59.789
And, the policeman receives advice from his
Dad.

00:17:59.789 --> 00:18:03.440
Listen!

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:18.070
…. So, that was Gentleman.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:30.409
And, probably, this might come to mind to
you, when I tell you my closing thought.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:32.519
Do you want to manage a team?

00:18:32.519 --> 00:18:35.700
Do you want to manage it well?

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.220
Get married, get children!

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.309
Thank you!

00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:49.999
Let us meet next week!
