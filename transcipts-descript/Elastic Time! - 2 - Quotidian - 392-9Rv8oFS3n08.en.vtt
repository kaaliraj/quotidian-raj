00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:07.160
Yesterday, we saw this book briefly, and I had promised to expand on it today.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:16.430
I told you that this book touched upon four
different unconnected concepts.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.140
Slipstream Time Hacking by Dr. Benjamin Hardy.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.079
Firstly, Dr. Albert Einstein was brought in, and his theory

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.279
of relativity, and space, and time were elaborated
on.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.980
Then, we had a Hollywood movie, with a smart
hero and a heroine, and an amazing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.980
plot…

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.825
And then, we encounter a concept that we often
see only in science fiction stories.

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:49.024
And finally, the author goes to God!

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:54.023
God and related philosophies!

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:55.023
What could this book be about then?

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:56.023
Shall we take a look?!

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.719
Namaste!

00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:21.390
While we enter this Quotidian titled Elastic
Time — Part 2, just one small request…

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.860
Suspend your belief a bit...

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.160
Enter the land with an open mind — for that
is how I encountered this book.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.360
Only if you do the same, you can absorb the
best bits from this interesting book.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.160
In this book, one first premise that he sets
out, is “Time is an arrow;

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.400
Like an arrow speeding forward in time…

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.578
But… Oh dimwits!

00:01:52.612 --> 00:02:00.960
The first thing you need to understand about
time is — it is relative, and your speed

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.000
could be different from my speed, could be
different from Elon Musk’s speed.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.090
Every one of us lives time in a different
cadence.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.170
In a different rhythm”.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:26.230
If you were to consider a race-car, and if
you compare it with a Model T, the first car

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.530
ever, the race car is probably two hundred
times faster than the other car.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.450
And, what it can achieve in one minute is
so much more, what it can see in one minute,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.630
the places it can visit in one minute, is
so much more!

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.760
Exactly so is your life too…!

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.220
The faster you move, the slower time will
pass.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.840
This is Dr. Einstein’s Relativity too.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.500
Time slows down as you go faster and faster.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.550
And, that is how you also live longer.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.100
The aim should not be live up to hundred long
years, or two hundred long years..!

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.420
The aim should be to never be stuck on a Sunday
afternoon, not knowing what on earth to do!

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.526
If you spend that time meaningfully, you would have enough to do; you would have lived long enough.

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:33.458
This is the first slap this author gives.

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:39.838
And then, he tell us, not only is each of
you running along time at a different

00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:47.548
pace, you actually speed up and slow down
in your life as you go along.

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:51.898
There are discontinuous moments too, in all
our lives.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:04:00.148
For example, if you are suddenly gifted with
a Study Abroad program, the things you can

00:04:00.148 --> 00:04:04.298
do with your life actually changes completely,
topsy turvy!

00:04:04.298 --> 00:04:09.057
If you get this opportunity to study at a
college at the age of 20, it ends up making

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:12.798
you feel that you have actually aged 15 years
in an instant.

00:04:12.798 --> 00:04:21.177
That is the amount of exposure and experience
you can get!

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.347
Compared to somebody who didn’t get it.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:30.038
Similarly, you get a job to work with Elon
Musk!

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:32.087
It IS a discontinuous jump!

00:04:32.087 --> 00:04:38.668
It actually takes you far far ahead than you
could have achieved if you hadn’t had that

00:04:38.668 --> 00:04:39.668
opportunity!

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:42.178
It is almost like you won a lottery!

00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:48.987
And he even gives his own personal example
about how much he benefited, simply because

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:57.138
he married his wife, who had a certain skill,
who had certain facilities, who had some riches,

00:04:57.138 --> 00:05:02.068
who was able to spare time for him, you see
that?

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:11.097
We are not living in one constant time arrow,
nor is our time arrow moving at a constant

00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:12.557
speed.

00:05:12.557 --> 00:05:20.557
And then, he also says,…long long ago,
think about how people perceived time...

00:05:20.557 --> 00:05:27.407
As far as they were concerned, the presence
and the absence of the sun were all that they

00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:28.407
noticed.

00:05:28.407 --> 00:05:30.918
And then, probably they sensed some seasons.

00:05:30.918 --> 00:05:34.097
Okay, now we will get fruit;

00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:36.747
Now we will get snow.

00:05:36.747 --> 00:05:37.747
And so on.

00:05:37.747 --> 00:05:42.608
And then, when things started repeating seasonally,
they found out that there is a concept called

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.608
a year.

00:05:43.608 --> 00:05:52.978
Much much later than that only, did they bother
about subdividing the day into smaller slices.

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:53.978
He saw Hours.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.538
For a very long time, the hours were enough.

00:05:57.538 --> 00:05:59.747
A sundial could tell their time.

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:03.238
Then, they wanted minutes, then they wanted
seconds.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:10.997
And today, if you launch a Google search,
you want the results before 0.04 seconds elapse,

00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:14.778
otherwise you start wondering if Google servers
are down!

00:06:14.778 --> 00:06:19.517
Because, today, we are dealing with microseconds
and milliseconds.

00:06:19.517 --> 00:06:22.927
It is an accelerating clock.

00:06:22.927 --> 00:06:27.818
But the author says, you don’t need to be
on this bandwagon.

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:34.948
You don’t need to think we are accelerating,
everything is going faster, we just have to

00:06:34.948 --> 00:06:36.997
keep up with it.

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:37.997
No.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:38.997
Remember.

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:43.138
The faster you go, the slower time actually
becomes.

00:06:43.138 --> 00:06:47.538
Thank you, Dr. Albert Einstein.

00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:53.717
Dr. Einstein has explained the theory of relativity
in many different, interesting ways.

00:06:53.717 --> 00:06:57.307
You may even remember this beautiful example.

00:06:57.307 --> 00:07:07.568
“When you are with a nice girl, an hour
seems like a second; but when you sit on a red

00:07:07.568 --> 00:07:11.867
hot pan for a second, it seems like an hour.

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:12.867
That’s relativity!”

00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:19.208
But, this author, Dr. Benjamin Hardy, brings
out three important precepts from Dr. Einstein’s

00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:27.627
theory and lays it out to the common man.

00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:35.198
He says, the most important thing Dr. Einstein
said was “Space is not a constant.

00:07:35.198 --> 00:07:36.918
Distances are deceptive.

00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:39.788
Long and Short are relative”.

00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:44.647
And then, he also said, “Time is not a constant.

00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:45.647
Durations are deceptive.

00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:46.997
Long and Short are, again, relative”.

00:07:46.997 --> 00:07:50.887
He says, “There is only ONE constant in
the world.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.597
And, that is the speed of light.

00:07:53.597 --> 00:07:57.427
Everything in the Universe revolves around
that single unchanging constant”.

00:07:57.427 --> 00:08:08.198
When the book claims to be about time-hacking
and productivity, why is this author talking

00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:13.297
about Dr. Einstein and relativity till almost
the third chapter?

00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:19.627
Well, the author wants to bring home a very
very important concept.

00:08:19.627 --> 00:08:24.247
He says, the faster you go, time slows down.

00:08:24.247 --> 00:08:26.068
The fastest you go?

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:27.758
At the speed of light?

00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:30.057
Time stops!

00:08:30.057 --> 00:08:34.227
So, if you are a beam of light…

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:42.458
if you are at that edge, that red photon,
at the edge of everything…

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:48.037
well, for you, time actually stops!

00:08:48.037 --> 00:08:49.357
And then, he gives examples.

00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:51.268
Haven’t you heard of Flow?

00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:53.558
What do you think Flow is?

00:08:53.558 --> 00:08:57.618
When you are enjoying it so well, time seems
to stop.

00:08:57.618 --> 00:09:02.088
And then, the other quotation that we have
seen often.

00:09:02.088 --> 00:09:03.618
Enjoy the journey..

00:09:03.618 --> 00:09:04.618
Not the destination.

00:09:04.618 --> 00:09:07.188
Well, that is because a light-beam has no
destination.

00:09:07.188 --> 00:09:13.508
As far as it is concerned, there is no concept
of, I am here right now, and in a short while,

00:09:13.508 --> 00:09:14.508
I will be there.

00:09:14.508 --> 00:09:15.508
It is there.

00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:18.198
It is everywhere.

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:20.068
That is the beauty of the light-beam.

00:09:20.068 --> 00:09:24.237
It has no sense because it has every sense.

00:09:24.237 --> 00:09:31.118
Beautifully, in very simple plain terms, the
author morphs these derivations from the Theory

00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:34.318
of Relativity.

00:09:34.318 --> 00:09:36.318
And then, he asks us a very important question.

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:40.357
Hey, I have been talking to you about time
and relativity all this while..

00:09:40.357 --> 00:09:42.438
Is YOUR TIME fast or slow?

00:09:42.438 --> 00:09:43.857
Do you have any sense about that?

00:09:43.857 --> 00:09:48.058
For example, we have all heard of Tim Ferris
and his 4-hour workweek.

00:09:48.058 --> 00:09:54.537
That is, he achieves in four hours, what everybody
else takes 40 hours to do, and in the rest

00:09:54.537 --> 00:09:58.448
of the time, like is shown in the picture,
a hammock in a Hawaiian island.

00:09:58.448 --> 00:10:04.568
He is not enjoying it like that, but he is
saying, that is the kind of enjoyment that’s

00:10:04.568 --> 00:10:05.568
possible!

00:10:05.568 --> 00:10:10.958
Similarly, if he is able to achieve in 4 what
we take 40 to do, do you understand what his

00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:11.958
time-pace is?

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:16.628
Next, he brings up the example of the famous
fable about Bill Gates.

00:10:16.628 --> 00:10:26.018
Once upon a time, Bill was so rich, that if
he actually drops a one-dollar-note on to

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:31.138
the ground, he should not lean forward and
pick it up, it seems..

00:10:31.138 --> 00:10:37.487
Because, in the time it takes for Bill Gates
to lean forward and pick it up, he would have

00:10:37.487 --> 00:10:39.918
made more money if he had been running Microsoft.

00:10:39.918 --> 00:10:46.118
For, Microsoft was such a money-making engine,
at that time!

00:10:46.118 --> 00:10:48.808
Again, what is your pace?

00:10:48.808 --> 00:10:50.088
Is it fast?

00:10:50.088 --> 00:10:51.188
Is it slow?

00:10:51.188 --> 00:10:52.308
Is it like Tim Ferris?

00:10:52.308 --> 00:10:53.438
Is it like Bill Gates?

00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:54.438
That is the question.

00:10:54.438 --> 00:10:58.278
And he offers a simple solution too.

00:10:58.278 --> 00:11:02.928
To find out if we are slow or fast!

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:06.028
Remember the quote from Steve Jobs.

00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:08.648
Whose agenda are you living?

00:11:08.648 --> 00:11:12.808
If you are clocking time for somebody, matching
somebody else’s expectations, according

00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:17.418
to somebody else’s schedules, … well,
your time cannot be fast.

00:11:17.418 --> 00:11:19.578
Your time will be slow.

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:23.407
Only when you move fast, your time will FEEL
slow.

00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:24.407
Don’t forget that!

00:11:24.407 --> 00:11:30.328
So, to move fast, you should be on YOUR OWN
agenda, he says.

00:11:30.328 --> 00:11:38.347
While talking about time, he recalls that
oft-mentioned phrase that says “There is

00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:41.978
no gift better than the gift of time”.

00:11:41.978 --> 00:11:45.458
It is a really beautiful quote.

00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:53.448
The time you spend with others, the time you
give them physically and emotionally, it is

00:11:53.448 --> 00:11:54.448
precious!

00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:55.448
The gift of time…!

00:11:55.448 --> 00:12:02.667
He takes it to a further twist, and says,
Yes, the time we spend with others is precious,

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:06.727
but, the time you can create for others?

00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:09.568
It is priceless!

00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:13.147
A sense of service!

00:12:13.147 --> 00:12:15.157
A sense of helping!

00:12:15.157 --> 00:12:16.928
Take Bill Gates himself, for example.

00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:23.547
What he did during the prime of his career
was not only speed up HIS clock so time went

00:12:23.547 --> 00:12:29.318
slow for him, he actually sped the clock up
for all of mankind!

00:12:29.318 --> 00:12:34.347
An operating system like Windows,
a company like Microsoft, a productivity suite,

00:12:34.347 --> 00:12:41.167
when he went distributing it all around the
world, every one of them became empowered

00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:46.297
and more productive, and he actually sped
everybody up!

00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:49.368
So, create time for others.

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:54.708
That is the greatest gift you can give people!

00:12:54.708 --> 00:13:03.407
Next, he heads out to Hollywood.

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:05.597
A sci-fi thriller movie titled “In Time”.

00:13:05.597 --> 00:13:06.597
Starring Justin Timberlake.

00:13:06.597 --> 00:13:16.278
In the context of today’s Quotidian, the
most important philosophy that we need to

00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:19.147
internalise from this movie is, “Time is
Money”!

00:13:19.147 --> 00:13:26.268
Because, in this story, everybody is frozen
at the age of 25!

00:13:26.268 --> 00:13:28.308
They are all frozen.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:32.388
Their age simply won’t go higher than 25.

00:13:32.388 --> 00:13:35.167
But, they have a counting-down clock on their
hands.

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:38.388
If they work well, time will be loaded into
their hands.

00:13:38.388 --> 00:13:44.808
If they have a coffee break, the cost of the
coffee will be sucked out of their clock.

00:13:44.808 --> 00:13:48.408
And, when the clock says ZERO, the person
dies.

00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:50.078
Watch it.

00:13:50.078 --> 00:13:52.428
A very interesting movie.

00:13:52.428 --> 00:13:57.797
If you get the opportunity, please watch and
share your comments.

00:13:57.797 --> 00:14:04.188
The interesting concept that he leads us on
to is typically a science-fiction concept..

00:14:04.188 --> 00:14:07.378
It is not really been “found” in reality.

00:14:07.378 --> 00:14:10.318
It is called a Wormhole.

00:14:10.318 --> 00:14:11.958
What is a wormhole?

00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:18.297
In space-and-time, if you are at Point A,
and you want to get to Point Z, typically,

00:14:18.297 --> 00:14:28.628
there is only one linear path, you go from
A to B to C to D to E to F all the way to

00:14:28.628 --> 00:14:30.708
Z…

00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:41.398
But, if you can warp space-and-time, if you
can fold the rubber-sheet of space-and-time

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:51.748
back on to itself, using a very powerful force,
it can actually create a bridge, they call

00:14:51.748 --> 00:14:54.717
it the Einstein-Rosen bridge, and if you have
watched the Avengers, Thor actually moves

00:14:54.717 --> 00:15:04.368
around using such a bridge, and this bridge
can help you go from A to Z directly!

00:15:04.368 --> 00:15:12.138
It is similar to going from Age 20 to Age
40, just because you had a bonanza.

00:15:12.138 --> 00:15:18.058
And, that is the slipstream the author keeps
referring to.

00:15:18.058 --> 00:15:25.037
And the whole idea of the book is to find
and grab these slipstream opportunities.

00:15:25.037 --> 00:15:32.037
It is not something unknown to migratory birds,
of course.

00:15:32.037 --> 00:15:35.707
A bird, when migrating as a group, they typically
fly in a V-formation.

00:15:35.707 --> 00:15:37.708
The story is quite famous.

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:38.967
The leader goes up front.

00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:41.268
Only he can withstand and overcome the wind-resistance.

00:15:41.268 --> 00:15:43.777
Strong wings and all that.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:49.818
And, if he gets tired, there is a role-exchange
that happens, a second bird gets into the

00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:54.758
leadership position, and in the slipstream
that he creates in its wake, turbulence is

00:15:54.758 --> 00:15:58.847
less, resistance is lower, the birds behind
can fly along smoother, with lesser effort,

00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:03.587
and that is the concept behind this formation.

00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:05.078
You can see this enacted in cycle-racing too.

00:16:05.078 --> 00:16:08.897
In the famous marathon cycling competition
called ‘Tour de France’, for example,

00:16:08.897 --> 00:16:15.258
there is a concept called the peloton.

00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:17.058
A peloton is actually a “small ball” in
French.

00:16:17.058 --> 00:16:18.568
Why such a name?

00:16:18.568 --> 00:16:21.347
Look at the clumping!

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:24.407
See how packed these cyclists are?

00:16:24.407 --> 00:16:27.638
And, why are they like that?

00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:32.017
To reduce the effort required for the genius
cyclist in the middle of the peloton, they

00:16:32.017 --> 00:16:35.667
place some cyclists who will pedal hard and
tear through the wind.

00:16:35.667 --> 00:16:37.897
To help the ones coming behind.

00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:42.187
And, if the wind is on the back, to give a
good push overall to the peloton, they form

00:16:42.187 --> 00:16:45.928
a wide rear.

00:16:45.928 --> 00:16:54.038
The whole technique in cycling and winning
such a tour, a long distance cycle marathon,

00:16:54.038 --> 00:17:03.788
is this:- You grab the right peloton and get
help from their slipstreams, and at the right

00:17:03.788 --> 00:17:06.888
moment, jump to the next peloton.

00:17:06.888 --> 00:17:14.748
I would call this the best takeaway from this
book, in fact.

00:17:14.748 --> 00:17:24.798
You work under a great leader, an amazing
teacher perhaps, but, a time will come when

00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:29.408
you will get a wormhole opportunity…

00:17:29.408 --> 00:17:34.848
a discontinuous jump might be possible, you
need to be ready to take that jump.

00:17:34.848 --> 00:17:39.388
To take that jump, there are four important
stages..

00:17:39.388 --> 00:17:45.348
Firstly, you need to acknowledge that there
exist jumps like these.

00:17:45.348 --> 00:17:48.518
Secondly, there has to be the desire to jump.

00:17:48.518 --> 00:17:53.338
Thirdly, you need to be confident that you
have it in you to make these jumps.

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:59.788
And finally, this is the rub.. this is the
secret trick..

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:03.368
you need to CLOSE THE DOOR behind you!

00:18:03.368 --> 00:18:10.088
You need to say, enough is enough, I have
left my parachute there, I am going to take

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.628
my leap of faith…

00:18:11.628 --> 00:18:18.018
If you can succeed in doing that, like they
always say, the universe will conspire to

00:18:18.018 --> 00:18:21.708
form a path for you to go forward, says the
author.

00:18:21.708 --> 00:18:26.248
This is not a new concept, really.

00:18:26.248 --> 00:18:33.468
All our lives, mankind has been riding slipstreams,
the author says.

00:18:33.468 --> 00:18:39.688
Just think about it, .. every one of us has
achieved progress only because of events in

00:18:39.688 --> 00:18:40.688
history.

00:18:40.688 --> 00:18:44.578
Our parents, our teachers, we have derived
benefits from them all.

00:18:44.578 --> 00:18:50.588
If we didn’t have a facility like the internet,
can I be talking to you?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:56.778
If an Alexander Graham Bell didn’t exist,
can the internet even be there?

00:18:56.778 --> 00:18:59.758
We can keep going back all the way.

00:18:59.758 --> 00:19:02.428
So, slipstreaming is not a new concept..

00:19:02.428 --> 00:19:05.318
But, to make you realise that there is such
a concept, and that you can create a wormhole

00:19:05.318 --> 00:19:07.898
opportunity, and even ride a slipstream, that
is the greatest gift that this book gives.

00:19:07.898 --> 00:19:11.378
Finally, something that made my hair stand
on end!

00:19:11.378 --> 00:19:12.378
Chapter 9…

00:19:12.378 --> 00:19:18.918
It is not important if you believe in a God…
or not.

00:19:18.918 --> 00:19:25.018
But, you do know that there is this concept
called God that people keep talking about,

00:19:25.018 --> 00:19:26.018
don’t you?

00:19:26.018 --> 00:19:27.288
Well, that is what the author comes around
to.

00:19:27.288 --> 00:19:28.288
He says,…

00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:31.758
“Light, Time, and God” is the name of
the chapter…

00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:33.358
What exactly is God?

00:19:33.358 --> 00:19:34.358
Who is He?

00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:35.358
God is Light, he says.

00:19:35.358 --> 00:19:36.358
Why?

00:19:36.358 --> 00:19:43.908
Well, remember the light-beam, and the end
of the beam that we talked about earlier?

00:19:43.908 --> 00:19:52.238
When it is travelling at the speed of light,
all of time becomes a single instant.

00:19:52.238 --> 00:19:54.908
It has no understanding of anything else except
“Now”.

00:19:54.908 --> 00:19:55.908
No past.

00:19:55.908 --> 00:19:56.908
No future.

00:19:56.908 --> 00:19:57.908
Now is the only time it knows.

00:19:57.908 --> 00:19:59.738
Do you understand now perhaps, why people
say “God is testing me..

00:19:59.738 --> 00:20:07.968
It is so long since I offered my prayers and
shared my hopeful wishes with Him, … but

00:20:07.968 --> 00:20:10.388
he hasn’t still granted them”…

00:20:10.388 --> 00:20:17.108
Well, according to the author, God is Light,
and at Lightspeed, … he is actually answering

00:20:17.108 --> 00:20:18.108
you instantaneously…!

00:20:18.108 --> 00:20:19.108
Do you get the point?

00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:20.108
The Point?!

00:20:20.108 --> 00:20:29.258
And similarly, when you are going at the speed
of light, all of space, however large the

00:20:29.258 --> 00:20:36.628
universe is, is actually a single microscopic
point.

00:20:36.628 --> 00:20:40.528
And so, you can’t really do anything without
God noticing it!

00:20:40.528 --> 00:20:41.688
He is omniscient!

00:20:41.688 --> 00:20:43.038
He is omnipresent!

00:20:43.038 --> 00:20:44.838
Why, God is Light!

00:20:44.838 --> 00:20:49.348
And, that is how he winds down this beautiful
essay!

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:59.378
Well, I have read about God, I have read essays
on the Theory of Relativity, Space and Time,

00:20:59.378 --> 00:21:00.788
but to propose such a connection..

00:21:00.788 --> 00:21:04.208
I am not sure anybody else has attempted this!

00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:07.608
It sounded so interesting and unique.

00:21:07.608 --> 00:21:13.048
Lovely, lovely writing exercise, I would say.

00:21:13.048 --> 00:21:19.428
Finally, the closing thought was the beautiful
description he gave for the word “Decision”.

00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:20.428
Decision?

00:21:20.428 --> 00:21:21.428
To decide..

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:22.728
We all know the word.

00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:26.388
But, do you know where that word comes from?!

00:21:26.388 --> 00:21:28.298
“decidere” is the Latin form.

00:21:28.298 --> 00:21:29.438
“de” + “caedere”.

00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:31.568
Each root meaning “off” and “cut”
respectively.

00:21:31.568 --> 00:21:42.048
Do you get it now?

00:21:42.048 --> 00:21:44.548
Decision means to cut off!

00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:53.898
Cut off all that is unnecessary and retain
only that final single most important direction

00:21:53.898 --> 00:21:54.898
forward..

00:21:54.898 --> 00:22:01.448
So, if you are going to decide on something,
it basically means you are chopping away all

00:22:01.448 --> 00:22:03.848
that is unnecessary.

00:22:03.848 --> 00:22:05.478
I really loved that point.

00:22:05.478 --> 00:22:07.068
I am sure you do too!

00:22:07.068 --> 00:22:12.158
Let us meet again, soon, in the next Quotidian!

00:22:12.158 --> 00:22:12.998
Namaste!
