00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.750
I am sure you’ll agree…

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.240
Nobody among us really wants to look like
this..

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.250
So, what do we want to look like?

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.230
Immediately, probably THIS comes to mind.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.609
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.039
Mr. Olympia.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.270
Mr. Universe.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.279
Probably the best built body in the world.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.859
He could pump up his chest muscles so much,
that he could balance a glass tumbler on top

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.100
of it, it seems.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.150
But..

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.190
But..

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.550
there are some who want to actually NOT look
like this.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.870
They want to look like THIS instead.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.290
Lean.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.710
Mean.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
Not a single extra layer of fat.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.489
Lean.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:01:03.960
That’s what we are going to talk about today!

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:20.000
I have become a bit leaner, haven’t I?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.780
But we are going to talk about a different
kind of Lean.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.920
Yes..

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.060
Lean.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.090
But, lean as seen in these books.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.690
Lean Management.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.830
Lean Startup.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.830
Lean Leadership.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.820
Lean Thinking.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.200
Six Sigma Lean. Real Lean.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.850
Lean Businesses.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310
Lean Starting Up.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.890
What sorta Lean is this?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.700
Should we read all these, to understand about
Lean?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.820
Or is there an essence?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.360
Something that captures it succinctly?

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.540
I searched..

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.079
And found a book like this.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.190
The Lean Book of Lean.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.209
Sounded perfect for me.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.740
And I started reading it.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:21.151
In that book, the author explains what Lean
is, what this approach is, what this methodology

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.070
is, in a way that is accessible and understandable
to everybody.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.300
Beautifully laid out, in seven / eight simple
concepts.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.590
That is what I am going to parade in front
of you.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.480
It starts with being “customer-driven”.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.430
See what the customer wants.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.070
And deliver that!

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.670
Very often we see people come up with products
that very few people want.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.569
You must be remembering the discussion we
had about the painkiller and the vitamin.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.640
The difference between the two.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.030
Vitamin — yes, nice to have.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.030
Painkiller.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.030
You need it.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.870
You need it now!

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.319
So, be customer demand-driven..

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.349
Recently, there was this trend.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.520
“Charcoal Dosa”.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.870
It will detox you.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.810
It is for Singles, especially.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:19.560
If we start thinking that this is going to
be a raging trend from now on, and if we commission

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.650
an EvoChef Dosa Maker exclusively setup to
make charcoal dosas, an optimised process

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.360
that allows you to “manufacture” two dosas
in ten seconds…

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.200
all is well, but… did we find out if there
was a customer demand for it in the first

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200
place?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.690
People should queue up, and only then you
will need to have to optimise your process

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.990
so you can spin out two dosas in ten seconds..

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.270
Else, premature optimisation, if you remember!

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.519
So, be customer-driven!

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:04.250
Next, the author brings up a beautiful concept
called “Maximising Flow”.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.300
For my surgery, to rehabilitate, my doctor
had a specific advice for me.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.920
“Movement is Medicine”.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.160
Keep moving.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.620
I encountered this video recently on YouTube.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.889
An animation.

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.889
A simulation.

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.559
A junction where four roads meet.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:34.090
They animate it to check whether the number
of vehicles that can smoothly pass through

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.080
that can be maximised.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.509
The number is shown in the bottom, in the
middle-zone of the video, you will notice

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.529
how the roads are organised.

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:45.620
Look at how it is being optimised.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.620
We start with a “no signals” scenario.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.900
Now, the traffic lights come on.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.599
Around 200 vehicles are able to flow.

00:04:51.599 --> 00:06:04.639
A concept called the Slip Road is introduced.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.189
The next is a continuous flow intersection.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:07.189
No stoppage needed for anybody.

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:08.189
Pinavia is next.

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.219
Nine hundred vehicles can go!

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:10.219
Turbine comes next.

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:11.379
And finally, the last one, Stack Interchange.

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:12.379
A thousand and more vehicles can ply.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.379
Two lane ramps.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.379
What is maximised here?

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:15.379
Flow!

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:16.379
Nobody has to be stopped and restarted.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:17.379
That is what people hate!

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.149
Not just on the roads, but in life too.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.080
Not just in life, but in work too.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.379
Don’t keep anybody waiting on anybody else.

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:32.689
If you can maximise that, that is a beautiful
Lean thing to do.

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.979
The next principle he talks about is Elimination
of Waste.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.509
We continue to “manufacture waste” in
so many unusual and unexpected ways.

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.539
He gives us a very shocking piece of statistics.

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:48.889
Sixty percent of what any company produces
is Waste, he says!

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:49.889
Unbelievable, actually.

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.449
But, he gives us a lot of research papers
and links as proof.

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.009
Sixty percent is wasted!

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.479
Could be because of defects, could be because
of overproduction.

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.389
Could be due to transportation complications.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.389
Or because of waiting.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.590
Worst of all is the Waste due to non-utilised
talent!

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.289
“I know to do so many amazing things, and
this is what they have ended up making me

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:13.879
do instead”.

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:22.599
Eliminating Waste — eliminating fat — is
another amazing Lean principle.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:23.809
This was interesting.

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:27.229
They talked about declaring WAR on Variation.

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.929
Don’t change a thing.

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:36.929
For, if you change it, the side-effects, the
after-effects, will slow things down.

00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:39.409
You will sway from the “Movement is Medicine”
principle!

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:43.020
It will make you immobilised.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.369
Will blockade you.

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:46.990
There will be obstacles.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.050
What is that “War on Variation”?

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.460
You come up with something new…

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.009
Don’t immediately put it into production.

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:57.999
Don’t keep varying things.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:02.539
If you have a successful formula, keep running
it.

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:06.050
You know where your variations should be played?

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.179
In your research!

00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:08.309
In your R&amp;D.

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:09.309
Labs.

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:10.819
There, you can vary.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:14.229
Just because… look at this Formula-1 Car.

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:21.990
Just because you have come up with a new wheel…,
lighter, sturdier, better grip, you can’t

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.909
just come and do this..

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:27.199
The vehicle will be imbalanced!

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.199
If you change, you need to change all four.

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:35.540
And, before changing all four, you need to
ensure there are enough spares in the pitstop.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.830
Because, this is production!

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.010
This is not a lab!

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:48.741
So, stabilise, have a plan, you don’t need
to have the right plan.. but you have to have

00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:52.810
a plan, and adhere to it one hundred percent.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.910
Keep varying the plan.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.180
Don’t allow the process to vary from the
plan.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.150
Keep varying the plan.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:10.860
Then, he says, Structure the People in your
team so that they are structured around Outcomes.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.860
Developers.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.860
Programmers.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:18.500
If there are a thousand such people, then
a Group Lead for those thousand.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.690
A Manager on top.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.890
A President above that.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:25.250
Instead of going in this classic timeworn
tradition, structure them … What does the

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.180
developer really need to work?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:35.060
To do their work very well, they need probably
an assistant who helps with Design.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.210
They need to probably work with a Marketer.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.450
They need to probably work with a User Experience
Engineer.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.450
Create clumps.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.680
In the hierarchy of “Team Formations”,
there is a sequence like this.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.190
You start with a disconnected team.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.080
Nobody knows who the other persons are.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.650
Then it evolves with a Single Leader, who
gives all instructions.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.390
To whom everybody reports.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:09.070
Then, there is this Forum where you listen
to me while I talk, and I to you when you

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.070
talk!

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.070
And then, a Community.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.040
We don’t need that guy up there.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.090
We both can talk, deliberate, decide!

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.450
He is not needed!

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.860
He will be available for us, when we need
Him.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.600
And, that evolves into a self-directed team,
where you can’t even tell who the boss is.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.350
And, finally, The Team of Teams..

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:37.110
Yes, there has to be some central guidance,
but more often than not, much of the work,

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:44.090
most of the decisions that get taken, we can
decide among ourselves, we are autonomous

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.090
in that sense.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.100
That is the Team of Teams structure.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:53.080
So, this sort of clumps, federated groups,
that is how you should design your team, that

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.700
is Lean.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:02.730
And, talking about resources, how to identify
the right resources, and how to train those

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:09.400
resources, … I am reminded of the 300 people
who appear in the 300 movie.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.430
Against them, warring party after warring
party comes.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.020
Two hundred to two hundred and fifty magicians
come.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.430
Then, about five hundred people mounted in
horses.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.410
And then, around two hundred people mounted
in elephants.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.410
One-track folks.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.600
Who don’t know anything else.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.890
Who can’t do what they are supposed to do
in a slightly different environment.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.480
But, these 300?

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.620
Each is a gem!

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.820
Each is actually an ARMY in himself.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.410
He can do surveillance.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.040
He can do spy work.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.540
He can actually do defence, offence, he can
ride on a horse, he can throw a spear, he

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.950
can wield a bow.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.740
So, that kind of all-round ability.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.490
That is what you need to nurture.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.050
What they must lack should only be time.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:12.010
If only I have the time, I would build that
product from scratch and deliver it to you

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.020
— they must be able to say!

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.030
Hire such people!

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.450
That, again, is Lean.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:25.450
While talking about getting people, you will
also have to talk about evaluating them.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.450
Measuring.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.460
How they are doing what they are supposed
to do.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.370
When you get into evaluation and measurement,
Simple is Better.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.230
As simple as you can, is better.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.690
Has to be clear.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.160
Has to be simple.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.370
Beyond that, he shares an interesting phrase.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.310
Is that a “Lagging Measure” or a “Leading
Measure”..?

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.950
What is a “Lagging Measure”?

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:57.850
A Lagging Measure is the measure of something
that has already happened.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.220
THIS is a Lagging Measure.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.650
You have binged on pizza last night.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.190
Today, you are asking for a body-report.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:08.030
But, how is that going to help?

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.100
It is a snapshot of history.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.010
On the other hand, what is a “Leading Measure”?

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:19.900
A Leading Measure is the number of reps with
a kettlebell.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.240
How am I doing?

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.440
Can I have a dotted like to how I will be..

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.810
Have Leading Measures, he says.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.550
Finally, have a goal that is very clearly
defined.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.510
If we had asked Usain Bolt what his intention
was at The Olympics, in 2004, 2008, 2012,

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:43.530
do you think he would have said, “I am looking
for a podium finish..

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.530
1, 2, or 3..

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.740
Just need a medal…”

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.990
Would he have said that?

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:58.280
Or, would he have said, “Not enough if I
win, I am gunning for the world record”.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:07.620
If you did the same kind of questioning on
company chiefs and marketing heads, their

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.760
answer might more often be “Somehow, our
company should squeeze its way into the Gartner

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.900
Magic Quadrant”…” or “We want to be
in the top ten percentile..”

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.960
Is this humility or is this vagueness in intent?

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:32.750
If you don’t define your ideal state extremely
clearly, these lean methodologies won’t

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.790
work, the author says.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.820
As a closing thought, I just have one observation
to make.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.480
I was doing a lot of “Lean-keyword” research,
for this.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.530
And, of course, the Leaning Tower of Pisa
came on the radar.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.090
When you consider the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
they have been building it for two hundred

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.090
years.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.080
Just a few years after starting it, they had
realised it was going to lean.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.440
And then, some wars, some famines, had made
them pause, stop the construction.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.060
And then they resume it.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.290
They build it for two hundred years.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.420
And today, it is a shining example of something
that went wrong.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.420
Poor planning.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:21.080
While studying about this…, there was no
single person to attribute the construction

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080
to.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.040
Somebody designed it, somebody else, a king,
commissioned it, and somebody else, years

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.510
later, finished the construction.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:34.160
I was just wondering, what if… what if it
was intended to lean?

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.310
What if the ground was such a horrible top
soil?

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.360
It is foamy soil, it seems.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.790
Soil that compresses if you put your foot
down strongly!

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:53.390
That is because a river’s water seeps underground
and makes the soil soggy..

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.420
In such soggy soil, where even walking is
hard, imagine a person resolving to build

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.420
a bell tower!

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.680
Imagine a person resolving to build a LEANING
tower!

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.430
Imagine a person wanting people from around
the world to visit!

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:13.120
Would we give that person credit, or would
we keep mocking at it?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:24.120
In fact, after the fifth floor, the pillars
of the leaning side are taller, to adjust

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120
for the lean.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.720
If you straighten the tower, it will seem
to lean towards the other side!

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.650
Because, the pillars have been done taller
on purpose.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.510
When you climb from the seventh floor to the
eighth floor, you will actually descend, it

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.510
seems!

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.100
That is because of the degree of lean!

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:47.890
So, why aren’t we appreciating it, as an
amazing wonder, that it still stands…

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.120
I thought!

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.580
Ironical, is it not?

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.990
We will meet again, next week!

00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:03.840
Thank you!
