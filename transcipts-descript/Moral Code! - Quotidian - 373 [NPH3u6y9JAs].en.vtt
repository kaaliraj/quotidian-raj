00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.399
Surely, you must have come across something
like this.

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:10.340
Some Whatsapp forward or the other, must have
told you about how Amazon has no stores, Uber

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.320
has no cars, all the way to Netflix is not
a TV broadcast channel, how are they making

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.080
so much money… how are they so popular,
this new economy is simply amazing… they

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.730
must have told you.
We saw "has no", "has no", "has no"&nbsp;, but - they

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.160
only seem to talk about what is not there,
but they don't talk about what it is, who

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.039
they are,&nbsp;… What ARE they? They are software
companies.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:01:05.190
There is a message there for us. A warning
fo us to keep in mind. Let us watch on!

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:16.870
Namaste!
Ozhukkamudaimai - Is there any moral control?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.720
Yes, there could be LEGAL controls. But what
about MORAL controls? Quite some time ago,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.130
on a Quotidian, in Quotidian-061, we contrasted
Newton's Laws with Asimov's Laws. One is the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.170
way the universe works. They have spelt it
out that this is how the world shall operate,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.100
and nobody can violate them. The other is
a request. Please do it like this, requests

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.400
Asimov, when advising people who are keen
on designing intelligent robots. In the future,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.070
may robots be designed with these constraints.
Assume you were planning to start learning

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.750
martial arts today, would you go to this Kill
Bill Guy? Pai Mei is his name… He would

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.150
teach you the Five Point Palm Heart Exploding
Technique.. All about killing a person before

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:25.140
he can take five steps on a level surface.
Or… Will you go to this teacher? Mister

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.560
Miyagi. The Sensei who becomes very famous
in The Karate Kid. Today, he is once again

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.400
in the news because of a program called Cobra
Kai. He is back in action, even though he

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:44.019
is dead. Would you learn from him, instead?
The most important lesson from Miyagi was,

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.400
Keep Away From Evil. The best defence is "No
Be There"! Don't get into that fight in the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:58.239
first place. That was the best defence he
taught. Who would you learn from?

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.650
Okay, if you are a software engineer, doing
code in your corner of the world, are you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:15.650
now thinking how does it really affect the
world? About twenty years ago, Marc Andreessen

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.409
wrote a very important article, I think it
appeared about fifteen years ago… He talked

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:33.309
about how software was going to eat the world.
He said, like we saw in the opening part about

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:41.920
Netflix and Amazon and Uber, about the coming
future, he picturised it beautifully and he

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.879
even predicted. Software will play a role
in almost everything that you see around you.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:57.430
Now, with the advent of SaaS companies, software
has become a service, and like electricity,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:07.169
like water, it is now available on tap. Which
means, "on tap", a software engineer somewhere

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:15.499
in Australia, or probably in Europe, can affect
the way you interact with other things and

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:24.220
other people around you… In one tap!
Proof for how famous that concept is? Well,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.090
it almost became a meme. "Software is eating
the world" became… look at the word play,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.960
look at the number of different articles that
have come up around that single sentence.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.520
Software is eating the world.
There was this movie "Terminator 3". The third

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.300
episode in the Terminator Series. In that
movie, there is a scene where Armageddon is

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.080
unleashed. In other words, complete utter
destruction. The whole world is destroyed.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:10.940
Watch that scene.
By some quirk, this is what happens. Everybody

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:25.740
launches missiles against everybody else.
There is a huge destruction. Devastation all

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:48.020
over the globe. When you see this, if you
are a software engineer, you should get this

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:58.920
thought. The question is not "Which idiot
pressed the button"… Rather, the more pertinent

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.210
question is, "With the press of a button,
something launched so many rockets simultaneously…

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.750
Who wrote the software for that?? With perfect
guidance, controlled by GPS, with near-perfect

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.190
accuracy, not an inch to the left or right,
the bomb that got dropped… Who wrote that

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:23.090
code??" That should be your question. Is it
ethical? Yes, you are an employee, bound to

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:30.930
an employer, who is asking you to write such
code, so you write it?? Don't you ask a question

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:39.310
back? Don't you have a moral obligation to
clarify? "Sir, you are proposing that we destroy

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.310
the world. (We are also in the same world,
aren't we?)"

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:52.930
Look at these photographs. Each of them features
one President of the United States. From the

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.710
time of President Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan,
till Obama, and even Trump… If you notice,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:08.670
next to each President, there is one guy.
Holding on to a black suitcase. It is called

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:15.000
"The Nuclear Football". What on earth does
a nuclear football really mean? Well, it looks

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.420
like a football. And it basically contains
the nuclear launch codes. Wherever he is,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.370
even if he is inside a remote toilet deep
inside Africa, if the time has come, the moment

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:36.480
it is evident that the world is going to end
because somebody has dropped a bomb on us,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.570
"What? Have we been bombed? Well, let us retaliate
and pay them back! Let us do tit for tat."…

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:44.340
was the crazy line of thought and he is supposed
to, or she is supposed to if there is a US

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:55.580
female president, insert those codes, and
launch nuclear armageddon.&nbsp;

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:05.270
Just open the suitcase, authenticate yourself,
probably iris authentication, launch the nuclear

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:12.710
weapon. Again. Software and hardware. Written
by somebody. Calling this as immoral, underlining

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:19.370
this as too much power in the hands of a single
person, a person by named Fisher promoted

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:29.110
something called The Fisher Protocol. He recommended
that this nuclear football thing should be

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:36.070
replaced by a Fisher Protocol. He said, yes,
let there be a person along with the President

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:42.729
all the time, but that person should be an
innocent cadet, newly joined in the Navy or

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:51.150
the Air Force, and he should be a volunteer,
who should have an implant embedded into his

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:58.520
or her heart. A small capsule sewn and embedded
close to that person's heart. The nuclear

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:12.740
codes should be available only inside that
capsule. So, this guy will just roam around,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.740
along with the President, carrying just a
knife. A sharp knife. In the pocket, like

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:21.800
a security guard. The moment the President
wants to launch… No problem! Just ask for

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.480
the knife, take it… puncture this person's
heart, take that little capsule, insert the

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.970
code, and launch nuclear armageddon! The President
was shell-shocked. How can I kill a person

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:39.790
in cold blood? Do you understand now, sir?
If you launch Nuclear Armageddon, a billion

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:47.680
or more innocent people will die, don't you
realise? Just because you are far removed

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.440
from them, just because there is an abstraction,
will what you do be justified? Kill this person.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:04.920
Is he not just another innocent victim? Sample
a single person from among the billion you

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.510
are going to kill anyway! If you still continue
to feel that you have to go ahead with this,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.660
for the "Greater Good", go ahead, do it! It
wasn't implemented, unfortunately. But…

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:20.840
I thought it was a very beautiful deterrent.
In user interface design, there is this thing

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.690
called Dark Patterns. We started by asking
"How is this fair? Is there no moral code??"

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:34.350
and went all the way to Nuclear Armageddon.
But, every day, like the bite of a mosquito,

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.790
we are suffering from it a thousand times,
because of interfaces like these.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:45.170
We think something is free. But, there is
a small print that says Shipping Extra.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:54.050
We are asked to download something, but four
out of the five buttons that lead to a download

00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:00.050
actually lead elsewhere, to malware. The download
button is actually… there!

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.510
There are many more dark patterns, actually.
Have you seen this guy, in Hindustan Times?

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.510
Do you want to allow notifications? Or…
Allow notifications later?? There is no way

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.510
you can escape notifications, it would seem.
There is no option. Do it now, or later, my

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.130
friend. But do it!
It gets even worse. These days, this circus

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:28.180
with the cookies… Accept and Close - is
all you get, in some places. There is no option

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:42.810
to say "I don't want to accept"! Dark patterns!&nbsp;
Many smart minds have debated this thought.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:50.340
This person is ex-Google. Tristan Harris is
his name. He appears in The Social Dilemma.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:58.140
A beautiful documentary on Netflix. About
how these social media networks are actually

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.350
ending up controlling us. The word "control"
might sound simple and straightforward. But,

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:08.290
he asks, "Do you really know what happens
when they "control"?" and gives us four sentences

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.060
to mull over.&nbsp;
You watch what they stream. You buy what they

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.810
sell. You believe what they show. You execute
what they expect. That is what is meant by

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:24.110
control, he says. How to get away from this,
what is happening now… Once upon a time,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.830
people were worried that there would be a
robot revolution soon, and they would actually

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:37.250
replace human capability, and overtake human
strength… but wait, they have already started

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:45.330
exploiting human weakness, don't you realise,
says Tristan Harris.&nbsp;

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:53.260
Dark patterns. Many smart minds have actually
worked their whole lives, wanting to actually

00:12:53.260 --> 00:13:02.250
control you. An interesting tidbit, we have
observed in an earlier Quotidian too… Mark

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:09.560
Zuckerberg's child, Steve Job's daughter,
Bill Gates' son… None of these products

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.350
actually need any marketing. Just get your
kids lined up, and let them say, "I propose

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:20.830
that you install it on your device. I am using
it. You are going to love it too!". Just one

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.980
ad. Let them feature there. We need nothing
else. No other promotion. Like asking them

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.839
to "stab the volunteer with the capsule in
the heart". Can you get this one person to

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:39.920
promote it? They are famous for banning iPads,
banning social media for their children. Why?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.880
If you wouldn't do it for your own child,
why are you going ahead and doing it for the

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:54.170
world around you?
My wife makes a killer Cheese Masala Dosa.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:14:01.839
And, the way she finds out whether she has
done a really good job, is she observes us.

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:09.830
My son and I, when we consume the dosas while
watching Netflix, do we pause and exclaim,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:18.130
"Radha, it is so good!", or do we give any
other feedback, is the way she finds out what

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:24.279
she should do next to make it even better.
Great. User feedback. Observation.

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:35.040
But, guess what Facebook said? This is exactly
what I did too… Not too long ago, Facebook

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:42.560
conducted an experiment across the world…
on about seven lakh people. It started showing

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:54.310
only cute babies. Only nice, cosy, beautiful,
amazing, happy, emotions, to one person. And

00:14:54.310 --> 00:15:01.690
to the other person, the other half of the
seven lakh people, poverty, violence, struggling,

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:09.140
suffering, pain, sorrow, kind of overpopulated
their field, removed all the good ones from

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.380
that feed. They have complete control over
the program, over the algorithm, after all.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:21.120
It is fully in their hands. And, they observed,
for fifteen days, how these people reacted.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:29.779
How was the emotional quotient of the ones
who received the Happy Feed? How did THEY

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:35.230
make THEIR posts? What was their MOOD? And,
how about the ones who were shown the negative

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:43.500
violence and poverty feed? How did THEY react?
This was measured. Without telling them! Without

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:51.000
TELLING them! Fully bound legally. In Facebook's
terms and conditions, it has been made abundantly

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.890
clear. Experiments will be conducted. We will
observe the data we collect. We will use it

00:15:52.890 --> 00:16:04.380
for our improvement. But, is it moral? How
far is it removed from what my wife did with

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:11.940
her cheese dosa? If that was moral and legal,
is this also moral and legal?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.403
And, now the logo resembles an infinity symbol!
Something that encompasses everything.. They

00:16:14.403 --> 00:16:17.210
have called themselves a universe. Metaverse,
it seems! I think it is meta-worse!

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:26.760
When you look into the IEEE standards, there
is a page we rarely visit. I bumped into it

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:34.730
only last night. There is a software engineer
code of ethics.&nbsp;

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:43.470
In that, Part 1 says "Public". Respect them.
Uphold their interests primarily.&nbsp;

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:54.530
Part 2 says "Client and Employer". Respect
them. Do what they ask you to do. As long

00:16:54.530 --> 00:17:03.149
as, the Part 1 is not violated.&nbsp;
So, looking back, all the examples we saw,

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:11.579
from the Cheese Dosa to Nuclear Armageddon,
with great power comes great responsibility - SpiderMan

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:19.160
doesn't repeat it ad nauseum, for no reason!
We have a moral obligation to the people around

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:25.920
us. Software is eating the world. We have
to be extremely careful.&nbsp;

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:34.850
Thiruvalluvar, in his 138th Kural, says thus:-
Nandrikku Vitthaagum Nallozhukkam Theeyuzhukkam

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:42.570
Endrum Idumbai Tharum.&nbsp;
Always, it will lead only to pain and sorrow - to

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:53.770
have bad manners, and to be without ethics.
But good manners, they will be good seeds

00:17:53.770 --> 00:18:00.440
for the future, he says. My point though is,
Thiruvalluvar says "Theeyozhukkam Endrum Idumbai

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:08.130
Tharum"… actually, the problem today is
"Theeyozhukkum" seems to give you good things.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:16.770
And then, later, towards the end, shows you
its true colours. So, it has become worse

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.600
now. Long ago, during his times, it might
have been pretty straightforward, and perhaps

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.690
good behaviour yielded good results, and evil
behaviour led you to bad results. Today though,

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.780
good behaviour yields good results, while
evil behaviour ACTS as if it is giving you

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:36.780
EVEN BETTER results, and makes it really bad
with the final rub. Take care. Thank you!
