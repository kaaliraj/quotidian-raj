00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.720
Many of you sent me messages.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:13.460
On the eve of the Republic Day, our CEO, the
CEO of Zoho Corporation, Dr. Sridhar Vembu,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.600
has been conferred the prestigious Padmashree
Award by the Govt. of India.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.220
Many of you appreciated and congratulated
us.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.739
All those goodwill messages, I have shared
with him.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.039
He is very happy that you are happy about
it.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.239
If you follow him on Twitter, you will get
a feel for what he is really thinking about

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.239
this!

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.810
@svembu is his Twitter handle.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.899
Ralph Waldo Emerson had once spoken about
what is to have succeeded.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:47.899
A bit long.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.360
But, it is one of my perennial favourites.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.499
A beautiful passage about the true meaning
of Success.

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:02.999
If I were to use that as the benchmark, and
look at the achievements of Sridhar Vembu,

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.440
a few things come to the fore.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.540
I wanted to share that with you.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.440
The “respect of the intelligent people”
and the “affection of children” — the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.480
school that he runs in Govindapperi now, you
must see it to believe it.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.190
The way the children relate to him today.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.800
“Appreciation of honest critics” and “betrayal
of false friends” — how he treats the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.351
ones who accuse him, and the ones who betray
him, both quite common in the world of business,

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:42.050
and the advice he gives us all about what
is the right way to treat such people is indeed

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.050
a unique perspective.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.950
If you read the articles that he pens that
appear in the outside world, you will know!

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.910
To “leave the world a bit better”, a “redeemed
social condition”, says Emerson.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.330
Zoho Schools is an experiment we have been
conducting for over fifteen years now.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.610
And that vision to help, to serve the underserved…

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.110
Has really redeemed a social condition.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.410
So, THIS is to have succeeded, said Ralph
Waldo Emerson.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.190
And I see a lot of that in his achievement
today.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.750
I have known him for twenty-five years.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.730
Personally, professionally, and I am able
to relate to that.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.819
Quite contemporaneous to Ralph Waldo Emerson,
perhaps about twenty-five years younger than

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:46.480
him, his student — by name Henry David Thoreau
— let us look at the definition HE gives

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.440
for Success.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.920
It goes: Success usually comes to those who
are too busy to be looking for it!

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.280
This is exactly how I see the way Sridhar
Vembu has handled his time!

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.209
I didn’t go chasing for anything.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:11.020
I am so busy handling my company, working
with my employees, working towards upliftment

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.800
of society as a whole, … I see it in everything
that he does.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.790
So, what should one do??

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.940
If one is not to pursue it, what CAN one do?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.400
Along comes John Adams to the rescue.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400
President..

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.020
The second President of the United States.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.020
One of the founding father.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.170
Look at this quote from him.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.680
Sridhar often shares it with us.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.550
So, we cannot ensure success..

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.900
For example, if you were launching a product
in the market, we cannot assure you that it

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.300
is going to be surefire hit or success!

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.260
If you were acting in a movie, nobody can
assure you that the movie will be a blockbuster

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.260
superhit!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.620
But, can you put in enough?

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.140
Can you pack sixty minutes every hour?

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.420
Can you pack sixty seconds every minute?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.520
Of good quality inside?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.959
Can you DESERVE it?

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.150
If you can put in the effort and ensure you
DESERVE it, whether it eventually comes to

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.099
you or not, there may be a thousand reasons
why you may not get it…

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.680
Politics may come in the way.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.870
Market conditions may be unfavourable.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.320
Covid may throw a spanner in the works!

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320
Remember the adage?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.419
From the Bhagavath Gita?

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.419
“Don’t covet the results.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.989
Focus on doing your duty!”

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.740
Similarly, we cannot ensure success, but we
can deserve it, says John Adams, in a letter

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.740
to his son.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.360
(And, who is the son?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.689
Sixth President of America.

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.090
John Quincy Adams.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.880
With golden advice of this caliber, I say
why not!)

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.650
Okay, what do we do to DESERVE success?

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.729
Well, we need to head over to ANOTHER father-son
combo for that.

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:45.830
Steve Jobs.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:55.900
In that autobiographical account that Walter
Isaacson put together about the man, he talks

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.090
about a memory he has with his father.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:08.860
When asked how he got this obsession for quality,
this obsession for perfection, he answers

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.360
by taking him to a fence in the backyard of
his house.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.289
“This fence was painted by my Dad.

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.789
I was there with him when he painted it, long
ago.

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:29.020
You would notice that the wood is still intact,
the paint has still held up against weather

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.020
and time.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.779
My Dad, before fixing the wooden slats together
with nails, he would paint the gap between

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:33.810
the pieces of wood.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.509
I would ask him, “But, Dad, nobody is going
to see it!

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.259
Why do you want to waste paint on it?

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.690
Is it not enough to just prime it with termite-proof
coating?”

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.969
“But”, he said, “Others might not be
able to see it, but I will know!”

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.379
I have let myself down, I have lowered my
standards when nobody was looking, my quality

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:56.690
standards have been diluted..

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:04.090
I would know about it, and so, that is what
I have to obsess about.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.560
Can I get a good night’s sleep?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.659
After behaving so atrociously, can I get sleep
ever?

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:09.659
No way!

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:10.659
I won’t!

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.159
I am not doing it for somebody else’s evaluation.

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.720
I am doing it because I want to do the best
I can!

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.119
So, I think that’s an amazing benchmark
you can use to measure yourself.

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:34.050
Every little thing that you do, if you can
do it to the best of your ability, forget

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.080
about the results, forget about what others
say, forget about the eventual awards, medals,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.009
degrees, grades, accolades, that you get.

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.629
Can you sleep that night?

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.270
Thank you!
