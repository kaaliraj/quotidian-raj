00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:06.060
If I offer these two to you, who would you
pick as your favorite?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.940
One of them is Abraham Lincoln, 16th President
of the United States, statesman, lawyer, famous

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.830
for having been a hard-working individual.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.720
Has done much to abolish slavery.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.650
The other is Confucius.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.110
For far too long, we have been under the impression
that there is a connection between the word

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.110
“confusion” and the name Confucius!

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.110
No!

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.110
Not at all!

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.390
That is a word from another language, and
this guy is actually Kong Fuzi, the great

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.530
monk Kong.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.590
A great thinker and philosopher from China,
from two thousand five hundred years ago.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.280
Some even call him the founding father of
Chinese philosophy.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.430
Who would you take?

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:06.690
As your favorite?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.440
Namaste!

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.190
We are going to talk about stupidity and ignorance.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:25.050
And, I had offered you a choice between Abraham
Lincoln and Confucius.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.890
I did it for a specific reason.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:38.600
For, Abraham Lincoln has spoken thus:- “Better
to remain silent and be thought a fool than

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.920
to speak and to remove all doubt”.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.229
Look at what Confucius says.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:02:03.930
He says:- “The man who asks a question is
a fool for a minute, the man who does not

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.560
ask is a fool for life.”

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.020
So, now tell me!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.480
Who is your choice?!

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.920
Earlier in this series, in Episode — 253,
we had seen about ignoramuses.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.319
The ones who know nothing.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.319
The blank-slate empty-minded people.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.970
Wondering what we are going to cover here,
that we haven’t already covered in that?!

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.340
Well, only after I launched that video did
I come across three beautiful sources of information:

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:46.230
Number One — Carlo Cippola, Number Two — Dietrich
Bonhoeffer, Number Three — a book called

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.940
Apprenticeship Patterns.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:03:01.411
From these three, I am going to extract a
few nuggets that talk about stupidity and

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:02.411
ignorance.

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.190
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a famous German philosopher.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.160
Unfortunately, he died, he was executed, in
the Nazi concentration camp, for plotting

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160
against Hitler.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.540
He wondered how German individuals can be
so smart, so creative, so kindhearted, while

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.050
at the same time, the German mobs and groups
are perceived as so bad and debased.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.660
After some thought, he came up with a theory
of stupidity.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.000
Bonhoeffer’s Theory of Stupidity.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.879
One important sentence in his theory goes
thus:- “Stupidity is so hard to fight against.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.739
One can fight evil.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:53.010
A higher force, a stronger army, a greater
power, more stamina, we can win.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.610
But, to protest against stupidity is so hard.”

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.970
In fact, he wrote a letter to Mahatma Gandhi,
requesting his help.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.659
“I am a Christian father, a person who preaches.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.060
I want to understand how your thing works.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.220
You seem to be successful.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.319
I want to meet you.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:25.639
Can I spend time with you?” were his words,
in the letter he wrote to the Mahatma.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.069
Moving on, Mr. Carlo Cipolla.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:32.969
Dietrich gave us just a Theory of Stupidity.

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:37.699
But, this man goes further!

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.479
He gave us five laws of stupidity.

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.719
He even published a book about it!

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.599
That… this is the cover of the book…

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.509
looks like you need to look at the word Stupidity
upside down!

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.479
Hey, did you notice the picture in the cover?

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.930
Seems to have a stone on the cover..

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.729
It struck me later, … probably Cipolla knows
Tamil?

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.669
To abolish stupidity, probably he is recommending
that one has to “Kal”..?

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.719
Learn (in Tamil)?

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.159
So, what are these five Laws?

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.770
They go like this.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.539
The first law says, “We all make a very
big mistake of underestimating the number

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.960
of stupid people around… including, yourselves”.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.349
We grossly underestimate.

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:40.149
Law Number Two:- He says, it is independent
of any other quality or aspect or personality

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:41.819
trait that that person has.

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:50.999
Irrespective of their talent, or their skin
color, or the language their speak, or their

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:53.680
gender, nothing matters.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.550
She may be a Nobel prize winning scientist.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.270
She may be stupid.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.960
She may be a worker in a small village farm,
she may be stupid.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.899
He may be a woodcutter.

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:10.449
He may be stupid.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.759
He may be the President of a very country
in the world.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.339
He may be stupid.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:19.069
So, no connections at all.

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.460
It is an independent trait.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.469
He has made this observation after a lot of
analysis!

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.819
Law Number Three:- Hang on.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:27.819
Wait.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.719
Will explain after this page is done!

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:36.020
Law Number Four says “We underestimate the
harm it can cause”.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.430
We always seem to grossly underestimate the
amount of damage or harm stupidity can cause.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.719
Again and again.

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.919
Again and again, we make that mistake.

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:55.099
And, finally, related to Law Four, he says,
Stupidity is the most dangerous adversary

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:56.099
for you.

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:05.360
If he is evil, if he is very strong, if his
heart is filled with bad thoughts, doesn’t

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.360
matter.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.789
What is the worst thing you can find in your
adversary?

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.249
Stupidity.

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.499
What is this This Third Law?

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:18.469
The Third Law requires a little more explanation.

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:23.169
So, basically, it is that famous four-boxes
matrix.

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:29.469
On the x-axis, the red-and-green-horizontal-line,
starts with “Harm to others” and goes

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:32.110
on to “Benefits to others”.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:40.580
Similarly, the vertical, y-axis, starts with
“Harm to themselves” and goes on to “Benefits

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.960
to themselves”.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.129
So, who is the intelligent person?

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:55.260
The person whose actions benefits him or her,
but also benefits those around them — the

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.889
society.

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.800
I wanted to take the example of Bill Gates,
here.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.129
Yes, he benefited a lot.

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:06.119
He continues to benefit.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:14.379
But, what he has done, what he is doing, seems
to benefit a lot more people around him and

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:19.449
that is Cipolla’s definition for intelligence.

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:20.930
Alright.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:27.529
What about those people who are focused on
benefiting themselves but actually cause harm

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:30.069
to others?

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:32.469
Classic!

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:33.469
They are the bandits!

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:34.469
The robbers!

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:35.469
The thieves!

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:36.469
The marauders!

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:38.349
They don’t care about you.

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:39.610
They are selfish.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.670
But, they are actually possessing some kind
of intelligence.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.670
There is third category, who actually harm
themselves.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.310
They are useful for others.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.379
Particularly, the bad kind of others.

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:56.009
They are useful.

00:08:56.009 --> 00:08:58.630
But, they harm themselves.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.379
Remember the term “Herd Mentality”?

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:07.750
They get dragged on in the direction they
are pulled.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.240
If the next random stranger comes around and
proclaims that he is the next GodMan, they

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.560
will just switch and start following him.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.500
Dangerous, for them.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.509
Beneficial for that “leader”.

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:22.949
But, that fourth kind..

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:26.170
That is the definition of Stupid.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:35.240
By their actions, not only do they cause harm
to others around them, they actually cause

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.040
harm to themselves too.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.480
I have just used a random fun movie poster
here.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.440
Dumb-Dumber — there was a movie by that
name.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.920
In which Jim Carrey plays a pivotal role as
a complete idiot.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.920
He would have demonstrated some very good
acting in that movie.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.790
So, they cause harm to themselves, and to
those around them.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.620
They are so dangerous! says the Third Law.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.000
Now we come to that book — Apprenticeship
Patterns.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.189
In software, what are the best practices?

00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:11.360
How do we design software?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.860
How do we flow the data around?

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.560
How do we interact with the user?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.089
How do we provide the right view?

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:21.870
— They call these patterns.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.870
Time-tested.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.709
Ready solutions.

00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:25.709
Optimised.

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:28.879
No need to reinvent the wheel.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.269
Design Patterns!

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:36.639
In the same way, in a similar style, if you
were going to get started on your software

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:42.940
career as an apprentice, to learn the craft,
the craft of software, what are the best practices?

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.740
This book visualises it very well for us.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.639
In particular, this book talks about the Dunning
Kruger Effect, elaborately.

00:10:50.639 --> 00:11:02.110
The Dunning-Kruger Effect basically says,
if you know very little of something, usually,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.690
you feel you know everything there is to know
about it.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:13.769
The less you know about something, the more
likely you are to think that you know everything

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:14.769
about it.

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:18.519
So, if you are getting started on learning
something, knowledge doesn’t grow much,

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.519
but your confidence skyrockets already!

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:20.519
See that first point?

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:27.981
The point where the person throws the book
over his back, claiming to have read up on

00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:30.240
everything there is to read?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.300
That point, they call The Peak Of Mount Stupid!

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.350
You are at the highest point.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.680
The highest point on Mount Stupid.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.180
Only later, do you get tapped on your head.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.810
And then, you start encountering more sources
of information and you slowly realise...

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.709
“Oh my god, there is so much more to learn!”

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:54.029
They call it the Valley of Despair.

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:55.870
You enter that!

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.709
So much more?

00:11:57.709 --> 00:11:58.939
Still more?

00:11:58.939 --> 00:12:02.990
This looks like a limitless ocean!

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.910
And then, and then, you start on a slope.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.040
They call this the Slope of Enlightenment.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.899
Slowly, gradually, things start getting clear
for you.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:15.110
Oh, okay, there is so much more to learn?

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:21.189
Oh, okay, the fact that I am learning how
much I don’t know, and that, by itself,

00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:22.760
is learning!

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:31.449
To know that I don’t know something itself,
is learning!

00:12:31.449 --> 00:12:39.399
Slowly, step by step, you go up the Slope
of Enlightenment, until you reach that final

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:50.480
dot, that final spot, where, probably, you
have reached a kind of plateau, a level zone,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.660
the plateau of sustainability.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:57.129
I have reached a decent level of sustainability,
and along with it, I have also gained some

00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.129
humility.

00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:59.819
I realise now, how much I don’t know!

00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:04.800
I was laughing ridiculously, standing on the
Peak of Mount Stupid.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.269
Now I understand how wrong I was.

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:11.519
That is the Dunning-Kruger Effect.

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:18.790
It says, the less you know about something,
the more susceptible you are to the trap of

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.360
thinking you know everything there is to know.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.610
Okay, It wasn’t just Dunning and Kruger
who said this.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.199
There is an Arabian proverb too.

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:36.611
That proverb says, “He who does not know,
and does not know that he does not know, is

00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:37.810
a fool.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.050
Shun him.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:48.850
Okay, He who does not know, but knows that
he does not know, is a student.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.939
Teach him.

00:13:50.939 --> 00:13:57.800
He who knows but does not know that he knows,
is probably sleeping.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.100
Help wake him up.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:09.220
And, finally, he who knows and knows that
he knows, is enlightened!

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.089
Is a leader!

00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:12.819
Follow him!”

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:15.079
Old Arabian proverb!

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:22.990
In the Apprenticeship Patterns book, one techie
engineer has written an autobiographical note.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.850
This is what I told myself when I was an apprentice
at my first job.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:33.769
I almost felt tempted to cut and paste it
in front of my desk, so I could see it everyday.

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:35.959
This is what he says he did!

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.290
Look at that sentence!

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.470
Tomorrow, I need to look stupider.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.820
All the foolishness I was demonstrating at
work till today, … well, I need to demonstrate

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.240
even more of it from tomorrow!

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:58.779
And, not just demonstrate, but I need to feel
better that I am looking stupider!

00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:05.860
There can be no more beautiful depiction of
the learner mindset!

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:20.089
Oh, by the way, our Thiruvalluvar, in his
844th Kural, gives us a definition for Stupidity.

00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:25.500
Venmai Enappaduvadhu Yaathenin, Onnmai udaiyamyaam
ennum serukku.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.029
What is Stupidity?

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:33.959
The arrogance that makes you think that you
are wise, is Stupidity!

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:37.839
How beautiful!!

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:42.110
Meanwhile, I just want to close with this
thought.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.110
Remember the ostrich?

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.700
We have given it a pretty bad name.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:52.769
There is this persistent myth that if somebody
chases an ostrich, and if it wants to escape,

00:15:52.769 --> 00:15:57.990
it just stands its ground and buries its head
into the sand foolishly thinking that just

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.730
because it can’t see the outside world,
the outside world can’t see it either!

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.730
Idiot!

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.730
Stupid!

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.569
Don’t we use this analogy?

00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:09.550
Well, please take this from me.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.490
People have observed this ostrich.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.600
People have done a lot of research.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.860
And they have conclusively proved.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.860
Nothing of that sort.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.050
Its nest is underground.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.470
It may even have some eggs being incubated
there.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.740
Some chicks may have hatched too.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.940
If somebody comes chasing, it would want to
do a quick safety check and that is what it

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.940
is doing actually.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.610
And, we misunderstand its actions and spin
a story around it.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:37.610
You tell me now.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.610
Who is stupid!?

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.930
We will meet again on the 26th.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:42.680
Thank you!
