00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.060
What do these Quotidians have in common?!

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.590
204 — Honeybees and Hens…

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.790
205 was about the A-Team Problems..

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:25.230
The movie, the top-notch teams in Apple and
the problems there, 375 was about bossing..

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.340
Good boss, bad boss, dead boss!

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:40.390
436 was about Despicable Me and we followed
it up with 437!

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.250
Despicable You!

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.520
What do all these have in common?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.820
There was one thought..

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.280
We kept returning to that central theme!

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.280
Yes..

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.500
That famous “DonkeyPit”!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.160
This is the person who introduced it..

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:18.710
Who is he, and what are the six questions
he has gifted us..

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.590
Let us dive in!

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.320
Namaste!

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.420
Four hundred and forty eight, is about the..
yes.. the repeat.. of the DonkeyPit!

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.799
How do you assess them?

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.320
How do you even know, detect, for sure, that
there is a problem?

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320
Related to DonkeyPits!?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.969
We have encountered this book earlier too.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:59.740
And, in one of the chapters of this book,
are the six questions that we are going to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.190
look at.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.049
The Survival Guide — by Robert Sutton.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.200
He starts by saying, “Do not have knee-jerk
reactions!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.050
Do not immediately label a person!”

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.140
He refers to this famous book..

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.940
He says, “Don’t just do something, Stand
There!”

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.730
It is the opposite of…

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.520
“Don’t just stand there, DO SOMETHING!”

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.710
I am sure you get the joke.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:42.750
So, understand, analyse, take it all in, suffer
through for a while if needed, all the while,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.290
answering these six questions, and then, this
book might be useful to you..

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.410
The Survival Guide.”

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.890
What are those six questions?

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.260
Question Number One is..

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.730
“Hey, do you feel as if this person is treating
you like dirt?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.260
Like trash?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.460
As if you aren’t worth five paise?

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.710
Are they sucking all energy from you?

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.740
Are they..

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.049
Are you feeling de-energised?

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.290
When you come back after having a conversation
with a person, instead of feeling rejuvenated,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.950
are you feeling deflated?

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.769
Being treated in an inhuman manner?

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.800
In an almost subhuman manner?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.019
That respect…

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.500
Thanks for treating me as a fellow-human-being..

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.549
they say, don’t they?

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.140
That respect, is it absent?” — he asks.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:49.620
I am asking all these six questions from the
context of the great epic, Mahabharatha.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.640
I am going to look for examples from there.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.360
For the first question, we don’t need to
look for examples.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.230
The Mahabharatha ITSELF stems out of this..

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.340
Draupadi insulting Duryodhana.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.450
Duryodhana insulting Draupadi.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.569
Dusshasana insulting Draupadi.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.349
Karna being insulted.

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.349
Why..

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.730
Let us go back in time.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.190
How about Vyasa being insulted by one of the
wives?

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.560
Dhrtharashtra being insulted.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.079
Pandu being insulted..

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.300
A War of Insults.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:31.610
A War of DonkeyPits trying to go one up on
each other.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.790
So, ask that question.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.470
How am I feeling during and after my interaction
with this person.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.470
Oh..

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.580
Also, how am I feeling when I am about to
get into an interaction..

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.320
Oh my god, should I do it with this person?

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.660
Should I ask this person for permission?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.250
That fear..

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.840
That hesitation..

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.430
That disgust..

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.430
Despicability.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.310
That is a good question to start.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.400
Question Number Two is..

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.100
“How long is this going to persist?”

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:24.139
For, most of the times, most of these interactions,
these behaviours, these scenarios, are time-bound.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:34.270
Probably for the launch of a product, probably
to go past a particularly hard phase, yes,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.100
you are forced to be unlike yourself.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.169
Friendly person becomes antagonistic.

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.360
Nice guy becomes thorny.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.900
Friendly lady stops talking to you.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.259
Will happen.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.620
May happen.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.970
Nothing wrong.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.710
Everything depends on how much longer.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.420
Remember the incognito period from The Mahabharatha?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.470
That is what Draupadi does!

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.260
She becomes Sairandhri.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.099
The lady who takes care of the hair-dressing
of the Princess.

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.400
SHE HERSELF is a Princess.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.209
locks of hair on her own head, she becomes
the hairdresser for some little kingdom..

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:28.209
Virata.

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:35.600
And, not to mention, you have the usual tragedies
of eve-teasing, sexual-harassment, too.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.869
But the question in her mind is, “How much
longer is this anyway?

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.809
I have my husbands.

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.839
I am superconfident about them.

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.690
This too shall pass..!”

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.890
Most pain, … as noted in Viktor Frankl’s
book, “Man’s Search for Meaning”, can

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.679
be actually withstood..

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:01.679
can be handled..

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:07.880
Why does it come, how much longer will it
last, what comes after it, what’s the purpose,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.760
if we have answers to these questions and
understand the situation, .. we can handle

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.160
this pain quite well.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.480
So, that’s Question Number Two.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.490
Question Number Three — Is this Temporary?

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.270
Or, is it Certified?

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:30.839
We have seen this earlier too, this dichotomy
between Temporary and Certified..

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.080
Where does this originate?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:41.880
Well, it is impossible for people to maintain
equanimity in all sorts of situations.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.239
Covid could have brought the worst out of
you.

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:54.419
A competitor launching a product ahead of
you could have pissed you off.

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:59.290
You are the CEO of a company, and the product
doesn’t perform during a demo as promised..

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.580
Happened to the great Steve Jobs, one day!

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.610
That can make you livid.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:12.710
So, ALL OF US, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US, have
the permission to be TRUE DonkeyPits at least

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.860
a couple of times in our life!

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:23.050
And, we shouldn’t be afraid, we shouldn’t
feel bad, we can’t get angry, at those people!

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.650
For, you yourself have been like that too!

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.900
Perhaps during the same time!

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.739
But, this Certified bit?

00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:35.970
Anywhere, anytime, with anybody, they are
like this ONLY!

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.300
Karna was a DonkeyPit.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.210
Duryodhana was a DonkeyPit too.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.210
Why..

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.900
Even Bhima, Arjuna, and the great Yudhistra
himself, have let things slip..

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.520
Have been DonkeyPits..

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.599
Temporary ones.

00:08:50.599 --> 00:08:59.300
But, when it comes to the PERSONIFICATION
of the quality..?

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:07.969
Anything this person does, to anybody, at
any time, is filled with maleficence.

00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:10.220
Is loaded with rudeness.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.220
Derision..

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.280
When you look for somebody like that, you
can perhaps settle on the Shakuni character..!

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.080
Even Duryodhana himself was shivering when
interacting with his Uncle, Shakuni..

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.660
He was never sure what grand machinations
were happening in his evil mind, aimed at

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.660
cheating even Duryodhana!

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:31.200
Yes, he says it in as many words, in The Mahabharatha!

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.130
That is the question you need to ask.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.940
Is this person temporarily behaving like a
DonkeyPit?

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.930
Or, is this person Certified?

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:50.479
Anything this person does, at any time, with
anybody, is this how he is?

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:52.640
Is he like Shakuni??

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.610
What’s Question Number Four?

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.709
Question Number Four is..

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:01.180
Is this Systemic or Individual?

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.969
Good company..

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.210
Good team..

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.540
Nice environment to work.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:13.400
But, this person is like a single drop of
potent venom… in the midst of all that.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.400
Tolerable.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.580
The problem comes only when it is Systemic..

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.789
Wherever you turn, whoever you look at, they
are DonkeyPits!

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:26.200
I am sure you remember this scene from The
Mahabharatha.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.130
This probably summarises the epochal events
of The Mahabharatha.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.930
Draupadi is being insulted, disrobed.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:40.219
And, up there in the throne, the King currently
ruling, is sitting there eyes closed.

00:10:40.219 --> 00:10:41.219
Oh..

00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:42.219
He is blind.

00:10:42.219 --> 00:10:50.380
The Queen is sitting with her eyes blindfolded.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.820
The brothers..

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:58.240
99 brothers.. have nothing to say, except
probably one guy, who is disregarded..

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:09.029
These five husbands, not one, five husbands,
are bound, by moral law.

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:12.969
They are told they don’t even own this wife
any more..

00:11:12.969 --> 00:11:19.980
The adults, the seniors, the grand old men,
the respected venerable gurus, uncles, grandparents,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.210
.. they remain silent too, having their own
convoluted explanations for why whatever wrong

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.220
is happening is actually justifiable.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:34.460
So.. the question Draupadi asks there before
bringing down all the curses, the choicest

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.789
curses she can pick..

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:43.870
She plots the downfall of The Kuru Kingdom..
based on the events of those two minutes..

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:49.500
But before that, the question she asks is,
“Is this one person?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.850
This guy? Or, is this Systemic?

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.000
Is the whole city to blame?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.580
The whole Kingdom?

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.020
(Like the famous Kannaki did, in Tamil literature?)”

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.870
And, only then, this happens.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.720
Alright, what’s Question Number Five?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.969
Question Number Five is the Power Equation.

00:12:10.969 --> 00:12:16.190
Yes, there exists a DonkeyPit, as described..

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.190
Fine.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.260
But, do you even get to interact with them?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.770
Are you in the same critical path?

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.909
Can you completely ignore them?

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:28.360
Can you live parallel lives?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.849
A large enough company…

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.099
you can tolerate each others’ presence.

00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:34.529
You can assume the other person doesn’t
exist.

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:38.219
The DonkeyPit is famous for doing that, by
the way!

00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:43.960
OR, are you subordinate, and hence you have
to report?

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.020
Which is trouble…

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:54.980
OR, are you the superior.., like in this case?

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:02.409
Shishupala, the Sethi King, insults Lord Krishna,
during Yudhishtra’s coronation.

00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:11.450
The 
friction has been present right from childhood…

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.539
He starts insulting.

00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:18.160
Lord Krishna had given a promise to Shishupala’s
mother..

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.930
That he would tolerate.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.470
That he would tolerate this DonkeyPit.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.839
He tolerates Shishupala one hundred times..

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:31.140
ONE HUNDRED TIMES!

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.350
Shishupala hurls the choicest invective at
The Lord..

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:44.830
And, at that time, the spinning wheel weapon
comes whirling, and does what it does best!

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.630
So, .. tolerance.. because He knows His power.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.470
That He could do it ANYTIME anyway…

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.640
That confidence.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.719
In modern day, you would probably equate it
to, “If you are confident you can quit this

00:14:00.719 --> 00:14:07.940
job and get a better one.. you will handle
a DonkeyPit very differently than when you

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:14.760
feel you are stuck at this job because it
is paying you so well, it is tolerating your

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.800
weaknesses, you don’t know what your market
value is, you are afraid to quit..”

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.740
Won’t you agree?

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.670
That brings us to the last question.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.670
Question Six.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.610
Are you even really suffering??

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:34.279
Both these scenes .. they are related.

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:39.700
Up there is Pandu..

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.289
Pandu goes to the jungle, taking early Sanyaas.

00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:47.099
For he cannot indulge in marital pleasures.

00:14:47.099 --> 00:14:54.190
While going, he says.., “I have never been
more peaceful, more calm, and more happy than

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.849
I am now at this moment!”

00:14:56.849 --> 00:15:01.810
I don’t know what the wife thought about
it, but that’s what he says..

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:06.620
And so, it is not any sort of banishment for
Pandu..

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:14.450
All the people who felt bad for him were not
understanding the reality..

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.800
The same thing happens, in the next generation
too.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:24.570
When the Pandavas are sent into the jungles
for thirteen long years, even though Yudhishtra

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:31.529
felt regretful in the beginning, through his
journey, he learns so much, meets such amazing

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:42.700
people, realises the true reality of the Self,
gets enlightened, so much so that, he quips,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.120
“I think all that happened is for good..

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.930
I have never felt this happy and contented..

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:55.039
With an opportunity to learn so many new things
every day..

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:56.390
I thank my stars!”

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.909
Draupadi actually gets enraged when she hears
this..

00:15:59.909 --> 00:16:02.990
But, that is how good Yudhishtra feels!

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.180
Why am I saying this?

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:14.990
Many times, there is a DonkeyPit, but we stop
with just identifying the DonkeyPit.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.630
But, who are the people FEEDING that DonkeyPit?

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:32.979
For every person who behaves so badly, who
behaves boorishly, rudely, probably there

00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:40.380
is this alter-ego counter-person who seems
to enjoy being treated like that..

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.910
And, don’t think I am talking through my
hat..

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:48.400
I have seen so many such instances personally,
in my life..

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.970
They seem to attract each other..

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:57.800
The person with the whip, and the person ready
to be whipped..

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:04.370
That’s the sixth question, and that leads
me to my closing thought.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.180
They call them a Sadist..

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.690
Those who derive happiness by causing pain
to others!

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:18.610
There is another group of people called Masochists..

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:22.400
Who are they?!

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:29.380
Well, they derive happiness by causing THEMSELVES
pain!

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.699
They pain themselves so they can be happy!

00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:37.990
I remember a funny one from a book I read.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.870
This girl.. is a masochist.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:51.730
She likes that pain radiating from the palm,
throughout her body..

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.960
She asks the teacher, “Do it..!

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.560
I haven’t done the homework!

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.030
Do it, hit me!”

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.470
The teacher is a sadist..

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.470
He..

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.470
Okay..

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.660
She, likes offering pain!

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:14.260
Oh.. they also know that this student is a
masochist..

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.000
So, what do they do?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:26.760
They raise.., but before slamming it down,
“I won’t!!”

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.690
Catch my point?

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:35.540
We will meet you in two days!

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.110
Thank you!
