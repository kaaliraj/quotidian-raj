00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.680
One of my favourite movies is Pearl Harbour.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.089
We have watched this scene once, earlier too!

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:13.350
Let’s watch it again!

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:29.710
When the junior General is appreciating the
senior General, the senior says, “I am not

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.609
really all that brilliant..

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.969
If I were truly brilliant, I would have found
a way not to fight this war!

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.239
It is no big deal really, winning a war.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.940
To prevent it from even happening?

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.649
That is what deserves credit, perhaps.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.660
To not do something.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.970
A puzzle.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.609
THREE puzzles in fact.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:01:07.549
That is what we are going to look at, today!

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.790
Namaste!

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.900
Four hundred and nineteen!

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.850
Remember the three puzzles that I was talking
about?

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.630
They actually started here!

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.530
Zoho Schools — That’s where I spend most
of my time these days.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.270
We have three kinds of schools there.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.110
There is a School of Design, a School of Technology,
and a School of Business.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.280
If we were to try and associate a single short
cute word to each of them, a school where

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.040
we teach how to CREATE experiences, interfaces…

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:59.229
where we teach them how to CODE (those experiences!),
and… having CREATED it, having CODED it,

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.640
you need to COMMUNICATE it to the outside
world.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.880
So, this is what we think we are trying to
do at Zoho Schools.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.850
I teach at all the three schools, and, recently,
while I was with my students, we encountered

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.850
something quite unusual.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:25.720
In each of the three schools, as part of the
lessons I was teaching, a paradoxical sentence

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.330
accosted my eyes.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.610
Just when I thought it was perhaps specific
to one domain, we realised that it was being

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.250
featured in another school too, in an adjoining
domain too..!

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.410
It seemed to be EVERYWHERE!

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.200
What sentence was it?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.910
Shall we take a look?

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.090
This man — you may not know him.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.090
He is still not a man yet in this photo, he
was a fifteen year old kid at this time.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.870
His name is Rich Skrenta.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.570
He has the dubious fame for having programmed
the first microcomputer virus.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:10.170
The guy who created the first “virus”
for personal computers!

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.290
Today though, he looks like this.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.770
His important message to the world, which
struck as odd to me, which left me wondering

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.070
why he was speaking so off the beaten track,
is this sentence.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.980
He said, “Code is our enemy”!

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.860
A programmer, one of the world’s best, we
might even call him… he says, “Code is

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.490
our enemy, and so, don’t create too much
of it!”

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.570
You may not recognise this person either,
because he isn’t associated with his real

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.570
photograph as often as he is identified with
his cartoon look.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.440
That cartoon image looks like this!

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.660
Coding Horror is the name of his blog.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.170
Jeff Atwood, who became quite famous through
this programming-blog “Coding Horror”,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.840
is also the person behind Stack Overflow!

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.030
They even call it the Programmer’s Google!

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.530
That group of sites called Stack Exchange?

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.680
He is the cofounder!

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:23.770
He spouts another similar sentence, just like
Rich Skrenta did.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.400
He says, “The Best Code Is No Code At All!”

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.860
Do you NOT create something consciously?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.949
How much do you choose NOT TO DO, in programming?

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:43.290
How many lines of code are you able to SAVE
by not typing them!?

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.530
That defines how good a programmer you are!

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.100
Such was the philosophy he proposed.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.030
Why did both these people popularise such
a theory about programming?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.360
Don’t they sound a bit paradoxical?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.970
Well, let us take the example of the Swiss
Army Knife.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:11.080
Between the programming world and the manufacturing
of this Swiss Army Knife, I see some similarities.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.340
For example, both the programmer and the Swiss
Army Knife manufacturer would be focused on

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.889
speed of execution.

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.680
If I were to start on a task, how fast can
I pull it out and pick the right blade or

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.889
tool, and get the job done?

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.419
That is Speed of Execution.

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.419
Yes.

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:39.409
Similarly, I will be obsessed about how many
features my software has.

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.460
How many different things I can open out from
my Swiss Army Knife.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.690
And, additionally, I will also be wondering
if it is flexible enough.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.690
New things…

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.979
Even things that the manufacturer didn’t
account for when they built it, will a user

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.400
be able to add it on?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400
Extend it?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.930
If we smartly combine one knife with another,
will we get a third tool?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.930
Flexibility.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:05.930
Related closely with this flexibility, is
Robustness.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.919
A program, or a software tool, when it has
to perform tasks that it wasn’t originally

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:20.400
intended for, stuff that the creator would
be hollering “I didn’t create this with

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.219
your requirement in mind!”, when the user
says, “I am using this for something else,

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.569
like one uses a pencil to look for earwax!

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.849
I have paid you, who are you to question me?

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.180
I will use it for unusual things!”

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.879
So, if it were to tackle these gracefully,
not break at the monkey-mischief that the

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:47.580
user does on the software / knife, if it withstands
without breaking or misbehaving, THAT is robustness!

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.190
And of course, how brief is it?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.889
How cute and compact?

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.289
And, finally, how long did you take to deliver
it?

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:02.169
I wanted a simple knife, you took two years
to manufacture a Swiss Army Knife?

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.439
While I just wanted a knife to cut bread?

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.439
Speed of Development!

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:16.819
In the world of a programmer though, the ironic
situation is that these six things we just

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:23.039
listed are pulling the deadline and the schedule
in completely different directions!

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:30.719
If you try to optimise on one of them, you
will have to sacrifice a couple of others.

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:36.779
And THAT IS WHY Jeff Atwood is asking us to
please focus on Brevity of Code.

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:37.779
Simplify!

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:41.300
Make it shorter, smoother, cuter!

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.419
Let us think about everything else LATER.

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:46.889
Reduce the fluff.

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:48.470
Compact it!

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.360
The best code is the code that hasn’t been
written!

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.870
Alright, that’s the CODE world.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.999
What about the CREATE world?

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:03.279
We were talking about “Design”.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.279
Consider this example.

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:06.669
We have a package that has arrived.

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:11.199
And THIS is what I want to achieve before
my wife comes home…

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.650
I want to hang that beautiful painting on
the wall.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.770
And I need a tool…

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.580
From here to there, I have to reach.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.669
And the tool is just for that purpose.

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:32.570
We have to realise that the tool is very important,
but the tool is not the end goal.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.650
We can’t ogle at the tool and say, “Oh,
how beautifully designed!

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.070
How colorful the interface is!

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.070
How heavy!

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.070
(Or how light!)

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.070
How safe!

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.840
We will not be obsessing about the tool…

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.540
Because, The Best Design Is No Design at all!

00:08:50.540 --> 00:09:00.300
Between a user and the problem that the user
is facing… and the solution that the user

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.690
is looking to reach…

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:08.100
The intervening OBSTACLE, the temporary DISTRACTION,
is design.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.070
Get lost!

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.660
Get out of my way!

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.570
Let me reach my destination faster!

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.600
It should actually be.. like this!

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.360
The tool should be insignificant.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.370
Shouldn’t take your mind time.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.810
Look at these examples.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.770
At an ATM, you enter, you swipe, you withdraw,
you exit!

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:36.040
Do you ever stop to appreciate how beautiful,
sturdy, and intuitively the ATM machine is

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.040
designed?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.590
How about attaching a file?

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.290
You are uploading something.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.330
You drag and drop it..

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.580
It just goes up to the cloud and says Done.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.930
In fact, some upload mechanisms allow you
to do something else while the upload happens

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.520
in the background.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.840
THAT is getting out of the way!

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840
Opening a can..!

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840
A can opener.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
We are curious about what is inside..

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.110
We want to gobble up the Gulab Jamoons inside,
as fast as possible!

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.680
See how beautifully designed this is?!

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.650
It has a can opener attached to it too!

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.730
There is a baby-proof mechanism too.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.930
Yes, thank you, but I don’t want to hear
about it!

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.150
How about saving a number..

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.150
A new number.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.260
You meet somebody, you want to add them to
your contacts.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.890
How hard it is, to add a number.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.150
We have to tap Create.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.290
If you don’t give some specific details,
it won’t let you save.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.660
It will throw errors.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.840
And, that guy is looking at our antics all
the time!

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.340
Why can’t it be as simple as we get their
phone number, and voila, it is done!?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.440
Get out of my way!

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.850
Many among us haven’t yet understood and
internalised that design philosophy.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.690
Google has understood it.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:45.190
Google optimises to minimise the time you
spend at Google!

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.360
You are looking for something..?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.750
Well, the reason the Google interface hasn’t
changed at all?

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.820
They don’t want to add bells and whistles!

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:06.260
They just want to get out of the way, so that,
your search query, instantaneously almost,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
gives the answers, and keeps going on!

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.720
So, the best design?

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.510
Is no design at all!

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.820
And, in the world of marketing?

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.870
In the world of communication?

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.600
Getting the word across?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.620
Spreading the word?

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.730
The Best Marketing Is No Marketing At All!

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:34.960
Hugh Macleod, great blogger, author, philosopher
in my opinion, we have encountered a few cartoons

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.450
from him in the past, he says this..

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:46.390
“If you talk to people the way advertising
talked to people, … “ What would happen?

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.130
“They would punch you in the face!”

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.190
(won’t they!)

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.400
Why are there so many Apps?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.000
So many browsers?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.840
Ad Blocker!

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.960
Ad Blocker Plus!

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.460
I noticed this quirk recently!

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:08.510
There are Blockers for Ads that are shown
by Ad Blockers!!

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.510
Why?!

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:16.970
We have grown in a world where we thought
advertising means interrupting.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.200
“You are doing something.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.280
You are doing it for free.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:28.930
For having allowed you to do it for free,
we are going to force you to watch an Ad.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.750
Listen to my message.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.570
Fill out my form.”

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.290
That’s not the world we are in today!

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:40.120
That interruption-driven marketing has lived
out its lifespan!

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.570
“Trust Me!”, says this guy.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.650
Will you trust this person?

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.650
“Trust me!

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.120
I am the sales guy!”

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.120
Why?

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.110
Why are we not able to trust?

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.350
Because, this person is looking for the quick
deal.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:02.870
Overnight, he just wants to up and leave..
for only the day after tomorrow, you are going

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.920
to learn that the product is broken.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.390
But no, those times are gone!

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:14.360
Today, we live in a world where we talk about
the ‘Lifetime Value of a Customer’.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.620
All life long, we need to build a relationship.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.110
We want that person to come back to us to
buy once again.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:26.300
We expect them to come to us to purchase the
OTHER things that we sell too!

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.770
Not just that, if they like the product, they
will wilfully and for free, drag their brothers,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.940
sisters, uncles, relatives, friends, and he
will spread the word..

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.190
“Be our agent!”

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.860
— we expect of them!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:46.220
If that is what you are looking for as a marketer,
it is all about relationships, and you need

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:53.230
to swipe interruptions off the table!

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.420
Marketing should not probably be done AT ALL!

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:03.250
There is a book titled “This is Marketing”,
by our esteemed friend Seth Godin.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.110
I bumped into two very beautifully written
sentences.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.680
I wanted to share them with you!

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:18.130
The first one says, “The shortcuts using
money, to buy attention to sell average stuff

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:35.750
to average people are an artifact of another
time, not the one we live in now!”

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.950
What is the time today then?

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.323
He says, you have to do this, if you want
to be a marketer!

00:14:42.323 --> 00:14:51.680
Learn to see how humans dream, decide, act!

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.980
Observe this!

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.030
Watch this!

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.470
Learn about these behaviours!

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:14.250
And, having done that, he adds, “Help them
become 

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:19.610
better versions of themselves, the ones they
seek to be!”

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.760
THAT is being a marketer!

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.750
Where is space now, for marketing, here?!

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:30.690
And, that brings me to the Closing Thought,
today.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.780
This is from Christopher Robin and Winnie
the Pooh!

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.620
Wow!

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.940
What a beautiful quote!

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.510
It goes like this!

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:51.330
“People say nothing is impossible, but I
do nothing every day!”, and guess why “doing

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.020
nothing” is so important?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:16:01.190
“I do nothing every day, and doing nothing
often leads to the very best of something!”

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:10.300
Because, when you stop, and think, you probably
might come up with a better idea!

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.540
So, No Design Is Probably The Best Design!

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.040
The Best Code Is Probably The One That Doesn’t
Get Written!

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.510
And, Marketing Will Not Be Called Marketing
Any More!

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.070
Thanks a lot!

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.070
Oh…

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:38.460
Today itself, in a short while from now, we
will meet again!

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.820
Thank you!
