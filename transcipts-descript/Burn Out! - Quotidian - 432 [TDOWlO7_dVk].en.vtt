00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.470
Kaa..

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.470
Ka…

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:09.220
I don’t know about you, but, this is what
comes to my mind.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.010
This black bird!

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.410
What about Kaakka Kaakka?

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.910
There was a movie by that name.. I guess in
2000, .. or 2004..

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.570
The famous and popular Jothika / Surya pair
star in leading roles in it.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:33.190
You may be reminded of that movie.. but, for
me, all that came to mind was the trip they

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.250
had in that jeep…

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.690
He flings the empty can into the open road..
just like that.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.940
And, doesn’t even wear a seatbelt.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.440
Neither of them does!

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.540
That is what sticks in my mind!

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.420
But, .. Kaakka Kaakka also reminds us perhaps
of this.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.850
The Kandhar Shashti Kavacham.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.730
Kutthu Kutthu Koorvadivelaal, Pattru Pattru
Pagalavan Thanaleri.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.020
Thanaleri Thanaleri Thanaladhuvaaga, Vidu
Vidu Velai Verundadhu Oda..

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.020
Thanal Eri.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.220
The burning.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:36.360
That burning is what we are going to talk
about.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.420
Let’s meet!

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.950
Namaste!

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.700
Four hundred and thirtytwo is about Burnout.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.409
The destruction that happens when you burn
yourselves out.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.670
I hear there is a term in Japanese, just for
this.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.090
We have encountered it earlier too.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.090
Karoshi.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.229
Death from overworking.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.440
They would work with a vengeance, it seems.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040
Work when they don’t know what else to do.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.350
Eighty hour work weeks, hundred hour work
weeks..

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.920
The government had to bring a law, limiting
the number of hours.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.570
“You cannot work more than these many hours
at the office!”

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.680
It became such a large problem.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.000
An epidemic of sorts!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.069
And when was this?!

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.879
Not last year!

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.190
Not after Facebook became popular!

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.410
This has been around since the 1970s!

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.150
The government tried to work with the people,
they brought laws, .. and counsellors..

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.380
About topics like how to manage workload,
how to limit workhours, and aspirations..

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.269
understand their aspirations and work one
on one.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.019
Karoshi!

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.190
Death by overworking!

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.319
What is the definition of Burnout?

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.230
If you start googling for it, roughly, this
is what it will be described as.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.640
Burnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic
workplace stress that has not been successfully

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
managed.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.959
Three important keywords there — chronic,
stress, and managed.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.920
It becomes large, over time..

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.290
It is about stress.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.650
Unmanageable difficulties.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.000
Unmanageable pressure.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.010
Workplace stress.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.700
And, it has not been successfully managed.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.269
What does that mean?

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.680
Probably not overcome.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.810
But, compromised.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.090
I accustom myself to that.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.640
I understand that this is how it is going
to be.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.069
And, I adjust.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.180
When I don’t adjust, when I am not able
to adjust, and when it builds up gradually

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.489
over time, .. that chronic workplace stress..

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.790
That’s burnout!

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.400
How do you identify?

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.350
What is Burnout?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.840
What are the symptoms?

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.480
Those tell tale signs they talk about?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.750
It seems there are three tell-tale signs.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.130
The first one, you get UTTERLY EXHAUSTED!

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.919
Monday morning blues… imagine that happening
every day, every hour, you are DRAGGING yourself

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:41.919
to work!

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.310
You simply don’t have the energy..

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.880
like a one-percent battery..

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.560
You can’t do anything really..

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.100
You feel like.., leaden-footed.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.710
Utter Exhaustion.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.860
Not physical exhaustion.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.990
Mental, emotional exhaustion.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.190
And, when we bring up the topic of emotions,
“Why are you so moody today?

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.450
Why are you angry today?”

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.160
Beyond all this… emotional numbness.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.100
An inability to feel any kind of emotion.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.820
I cannot be happy.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.000
I cannot be unhappy.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.770
I am not able to bear that emotion.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.770
I am detached.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.600
I don’t seem connected.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.360
We need SOME emotion, we are told.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.120
That is natural human tendency, they say.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:49.940
If you don’t have that, if a vacuum supplants
it, that is the second telltale sign.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.069
And of course, there is a third level.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:03.190
After exhaustion and emotional numbness, you
feel simply insignificant.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.630
In this universe.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.039
In this company.

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.990
In this team.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.509
Does anybody even care I exist?

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.169
If a bus runs over me tomorrow, will anybody
even notice?

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.920
Am I contributing anything meaningful, significant…?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.850
What am I?

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.319
That utter insignificance.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:39.970
I am incompetent, I am simply not doing anything
meaningful — that sort of feeling.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.009
The three stages, the three symptoms that
you are burning out!

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:49.360
Why does this fatigue come, after all?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.339
The Man of the Stone Ages WORKED.

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:58.190
Before the Industrial Revolution, people sweated
it out.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:05.090
Even after the Industrial Revolution, there
was a lot of physical labour.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:15.580
But, in the office of today, irrespective
of the domain you are working in, we are at

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.259
work in front of a computer, in an airconditioned
room..

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:26.180
What kind of fatigue could we have in that??

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.180
You might ask.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:35.410
But, Mr. Michael Inzlicht, a researcher in
the University of Toronto, says fatigue is

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.930
actually coming from an evolutionary reaction.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.240
Remember the Stone Age Man you were talking
about?

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:52.289
Yes, from the times of the Stone Age Man,
the body has been tuned to be aware that it

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.009
has other work to do.

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:58.490
“Are you hunting all the time?

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.039
Who will fetch the food and deliver it home?

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:05.500
Are you fiddling with fire all the time?

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.629
Who will hunt then?

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:09.650
Are you hunting all the time?

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.481
Who will take care of the children?

00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:16.020
Who will protect your wife from being dragged
away by a competing alpha male?

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.710
Who will give birth to kids?”

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:26.139
There were conflicting needs on the human
body and the psyche.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:33.680
And so, when you did something for too long,
it was the evolutionary trigger, .. perfected

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.700
over many thousands of years..

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.719
You need to be told “Hey, you have been
doing this for too long..

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:46.390
You have forgotten that other thing…”
— and, no disembodied spirit will do that

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.390
for you.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.620
Instead, it will manifest itself as fatigue.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.500
That was the root cause, the origin, of fatigue,
it seems.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.940
What do I take away from this?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.100
Well, monotony at the workplace.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.120
Irrespective of the domain you are in, if
you continue doing the same thing over and

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:14.860
over again, with not much variety day to day,
hour to hour, burnout is imminent.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.800
There has been much more research done on
this topic.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.579
I did look around extensively on this matter.

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:27.650
They ask a question and answer it themselves,
in one of the research documents I encountered.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.310
They ask, “What do you think leads to burnout?

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.240
Do you think it is physical effort?

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:39.390
Have you sweated it out, used up your muscles
much, tired yourselves out?

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.390
No!

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.389
That doesn’t lead to burnout.

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:48.370
In fact, like I just said, most work today
is NOT physical!

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.110
There are machines.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.450
There are robots..

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:58.170
That do the job for you!

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.520
Is it mental strain?

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.490
Do we make the brain work too much?

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.110
Make it think too often?

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.730
They measured it, it seems..

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:16.620
How much energy, how many calories more does
a person who does a lot of numerical calculations,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:23.430
lot of estimations, lot of gambling decisions
like in a business, how much more does this

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:36.620
person burn, versus this other person watching
Netflix, or chilling out in a beach..?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.110
Believe it or not..

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.740
It is the energy equivalent of a peanut.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.760
That is all!

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.350
The brain uses only the energy derived from
that of a single peanut, when calculating,

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.010
estimating, gambling, guessing..!

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:56.290
So, surely, mental strain may not be the reason.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.180
Okay, .. is there a timeline fear?

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.180
Tension?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.130
A sword dangling from above?

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.130
A clock ticking?

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.279
The fear and the need to finish something
by a set deadline?

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:09.420
Is that fear the reason?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:17.410
Having to do something for too long, having
to finish something in a short while..?

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.040
Could that be the reason?

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.060
Nope.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.110
Not that either.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:34.350
After a lot of evaluation, a lot of research,
probably 15,000 people across various domains,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:42.470
they did surveys, they did psychoanalyses,
and they have arrived at one overarching reason

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.790
why that could be the reason for burnout.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:55.020
They have declared that this could be the
most important reason for burnout.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.640
Guess what that is?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.880
Observe that person.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.620
That is it!

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.520
The feeling that you are not in control!

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.720
The agency..

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720
the autonomy..

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.680
Irrespective of whether I am struggling or
enjoying, the ability to change that is in

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680
my hands!

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.380
I am the one who brought this upon myself!

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.380
I can, with some effort, change the course
of things!

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.500
When you lack that sense of autonomy, they
say burnout sets in!

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.680
This lady has delivered an amazing TED Talk.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.899
Gloria Chan is her name.

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:35.199
Beautiful TED Talk!

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:40.010
The talk’s title is “Work is not family”!

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.000
Many companies, I myself, we have committed
this sin!

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.760
When talking to our teammates, we exhort,
“Welcome to the Family!

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.199
We are all like close-knit family!”

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:54.600
we would drone on!

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.610
Yes, surely nice to hear.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.770
Builds team spirit.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:10.420
But, if overused…, if we use it in the wrong
places, inappropriately, it can lead to some

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:17.160
activities, some ways of thinking that will
spiral directly to burnout.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.660
Do NOT say that, says Dr. Chan.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:28.632
Just think about it, if you did a favour to
a family member, would you ask for money?

00:13:28.632 --> 00:13:30.190
Would you get paid?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.110
Would you even open the topic?

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.740
Would you let them talk?

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.600
Won’t you slap them immediately?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:43.040
But, at the same time, if your CEO were paying
you your salary, how do you react?

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.410
Right there, don’t you see the differentiation…

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.422
Well, we talked about money.

00:13:49.422 --> 00:13:51.870
I thought we should draw a few distinctions.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.110
On one side, we have Time.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.339
On the other side, we have Money.

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:00.850
How different are they?

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.360
How similar are they?

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.550
First, let us look at the definitions.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:15.170
Time is the amount of hours you spend on a
job.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:22.130
Money is the return-gift you get for having
spent the Time at the job.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.050
Can you replenish it?

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.690
If you lose money, you can gain it..

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.889
In fact, sometimes, you lose money to gain
more money!

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:33.889
Principal.

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:35.829
Seed money!

00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:42.730
But, when you lose time, you don’t gain
it back, do you?

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.080
What is the Value of Time?

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.730
The Value of Past Time is Zero.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.060
Only Future Time has any Value at all!

00:14:51.060 --> 00:15:00.040
If we don’t use the Present Time well, it
too will become Past Time.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.040
Money?

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.180
Over time, it actually reduces in Value.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.800
They call it the Time Value of Money.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:14.000
If you have hundred rupees today…, you can
actually equate it to two hundred rupees tomorrow.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.899
Even if you give me ten thousand rupees five
days from now, I may be able to do more with

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:22.100
the hundred rupees you give me right now!

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.130
It is all in the hands of the person who uses
the money!

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.880
That is Value!

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.230
What about Earnability?

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.790
You can earn money.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:36.870
You can put some effort, earn money, give
time, earn money!

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.870
Can you give money and get time?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.890
Very hard.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:48.339
In fact, it is nearly impossible to procure
Real Time back in your hands.

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:51.790
What about the Spending Pattern?

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:57.750
Whatever you are doing or not doing, you are
spending time.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.490
You have spent ten minutes of your time.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.480
Thank you for it..

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.480
Watching this video.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.699
You are not going to get it back.

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:09.699
But, Money?

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:13.339
I can choose to not spend it.

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.940
You can change the Spend Pattern.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.490
Spend more later, spend lesser now..!

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.490
Storability?

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:26.410
Let us preserve some of it now, let us use
it up later…

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:31.759
You can do that with Money, can you do that
with Time?

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:32.820
Just running past you…

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.720
We saw so many comparisons.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.620
Did it ring a bell?

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.399
Did it wake you up to a grim reality?

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.570
What is more valuable?

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.680
Time or Money?

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.610
And, all the time, what are we doing, at work?

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.850
Giving Time..

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.560
Taking Money..

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.290
Do you see the paradox there?

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.290
The irony?

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:02.269
In literature, in English literature, there
are proverbs like these!

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:10.030
“Better to light one candle than to curse
the darkness.”

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:17.260
Talking about the same candle, there is another
proverb like this.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.439
“A candle loses nothing by lighting another
candle”!

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:27.839
Can you tell which candle lit the other two?

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.299
No way!

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:37.799
They are all burning beautifully together..

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:44.919
If you spend some more time thinking about
this candle, you will encounter another phrase.

00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:46.640
“Burning the midnight oil”.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:54.790
In the olden days, when the sun is down, people
burned the midnight oil, whenever they had

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.790
to overwork.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:01.360
But, wait, there is an even worse case.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:08.180
If you thought burning the midnight oil signified
burnout, you will need to meet this phrase

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.919
in English: “Burning the candle on both
ends!”

00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:18.309
Imagine lighting a candle on both ends.

00:18:18.309 --> 00:18:26.440
You are allowing yourself to be consumed at
great speed.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.760
Burning the candle on both ends.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.020
Is this efficient?

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:37.450
How will they even hold on to it?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.140
Is this giving the correct amount of light?

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:47.110
Or, is some illumination lost because two
light sources are so close to each other?

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.220
One’s light being wasted on the other, and
so on..

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.430
Has somebody performed any experiments, I
wondered.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.430
Yes!

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.430
Lo and behold!

00:18:54.430 --> 00:19:00.250
There is a physics experiment that actually
derives something very interesting!

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:08.060
A physics professor lights both ends of a
candle, and demonstrates practically, about

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.940
the effects of Newton’s Laws and Angular
Momentum!

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.470
But, unwittingly, it is teaching us a lot
more too!

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.990
There is a bigger lesson.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.990
Listen!

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.580
“The experiment is ready to go!

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.749
The experiment teaches us about combustion,
and Newton’s Third Law of Motion.

00:19:28.749 --> 00:19:35.070
A candle that is balanced between two glasses
will rock or seesaw up and down on its own!

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:40.679
If one end of the candle burns more quickly
than the other, the lighter side of the candle

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:44.282
moves up, the lower side of the candle will
angle such that the flame melts the wax, causing

00:19:44.282 --> 00:19:45.282
it to drip down…

00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:46.282
We are starting to see the wax starting to
drip.. and we are starting to get a little

00:19:46.282 --> 00:19:58.520
bit more of a rocking motion here.. the weight
is altered as the wax drips.. one or two drops

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:04.730
on the left, and a whole bunch drips on the
right, and that is what gets your weight transferred,

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:10.530
the mass going back and forth, and getting
that seesaw action!

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:20.090
Try different candles, peel off the other
end to get to the wick, make sure you don’t

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:26.390
peel off too much, you want to have that weight
so you can see it rock…

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.540
That last little piece right there… is pretty
cool!”

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.679
Seesaw!

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:38.390
When I saw this, instantly, the philosophy
from that stuck out.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.390
You cannot balance..!

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:45.480
When people are talking about the impossibility
of the Work Life Balance, how are we going

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.440
to balance Work 1 and Work 2?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.679
No way!

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:55.380
The burning of the candle on both ends, is
NOT a sustainable activity!

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.020
Please realise!

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:08.850
We thought, in the times of Covid, this is
amazing for introverts!

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:13.970
All I had to do was face a computer, sit at
home, nobody to disturb me, nobody to ask

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.049
me to speak up, we thought.

00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:23.080
But Covid time, lockdown time, and work from
home time, that is so prevalent these days,

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.909
is hard even for an introvert.

00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:32.250
That “Always on Record Mode”, “Always
on Presentation Mode”, “I am being put

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:37.390
on show” is really damaging to the psyche.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:43.679
And, when you look at them as individual little
boxes, so much of them is hidden from view,

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:51.130
their nonverbal cues, their body language,
is hidden, and we are not able to guess what

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.240
their reactions actually are.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:22:06.000
And so, Morra Aarons, she is also a TED Speaker,
she says, create an office space at home!

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.241
Even if you remodel your home, if you are
doing two works in the same place, if you

00:22:12.241 --> 00:22:22.580
are working from the kitchen as well as cooking
in the kitchen, learn to create the environment.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.980
She also says, you need personal space.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:32.130
Once in a while, have a routine, a ritual,
where you put an invisible tent around yourself:

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.600
husband, wife, child, boss, team member..

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.610
No, My personal space!

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:46.919
Also she recommends that we should try to
manage the room.

00:22:46.919 --> 00:22:52.980
In a real room, if a person is too talkative,
we ask them to take a pause, and let the other

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.980
people speak.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.260
Similarly, we should do the same in an online
room too.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.520
You should take the additional responsibility…

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.850
each person..

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.470
To silence the talkative people, let the others
speak up..

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.410
Everybody must be given that opportunity,
she says.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:15.080
And, also, instead of saying you would do
everything only via audio / video, go for

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.010
asynchronous!

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.520
Can I record a video and send you a message?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.159
Can I send it as a typed email?

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:23.659
They were golden!

00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:27.669
They have been around for forty-five years
now!

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:32.110
Try those asynchronous modes of communication,
she says!

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.620
I saw this book recently.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.260
The title sounded so interesting..

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.500
Oh, before that, the author’s name sounded
so interesting!

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.700
Om Swami!

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.400
I am going to read this book and find out
what it is all about.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.429
But, look at the title.

00:23:46.429 --> 00:23:48.520
Mind Full to Mindful!

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:54.670
“Embrace the present moment” is an advice,
a golden piece of wisdom given to us by almost

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.900
every Wise Sage.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:01.280
We are full of the Past and the Future.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.030
We forget the Present.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:10.789
That mindfulness practice too, is useful to
reduce burnout, I think.

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:12.760
I had a friend.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760
A colleague.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760
Girish is his name.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.610
He is not with us now, but he left behind
a very interesting thought..

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:25.039
We were having a conversation, and he said,
“I wish…” and that still remains in

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:28.000
my mind as if it was yesterday.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.610
“Do you know how a company should operate?”,
he began.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.940
“We need to enforce two rules.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.130
The first rule is everybody should be forced
to take a vacation.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.310
You HAVE to.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:46.980
Lock your computer up, deactivate your account..

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.600
Go!

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.640
And, the second rule is even more powerful.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.620
The second rule, it comes with an expiry date,
your salary.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:03.100
If you are given some amount of money, you
need to spend it off!

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:09.320
You keep saving it for the future, you stop
being considerate of the Present, you struggle,

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.049
you sacrifice, all in the hope of some distant
future probability.”

00:25:13.049 --> 00:25:14.580
Such were his rules!

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.580
Sounded interesting!

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.730
I don’t know where he is now, but beautiful
suggestions!

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:26.120
When I make a video, I make a thumbnail too,
you know that by now.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.610
This is how I started it.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.720
But, I changed it to something like this.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.690
Do you see the difference?

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.520
In the one above, you are ABLE to see the
difference.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.840
It is getting warmer!

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.270
But, here, it is a gradient!

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.090
And, that is the problem with burnout!

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:50.330
When it starts hitting you, you don’t realise
until it is too late.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.490
I hope it doesn’t happen to you and me.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.870
You should keep looking for those early warnings.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.990
Looking for those early warnings?

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.990
How?!

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.309
Do you remember this speedometer?

00:26:02.309 --> 00:26:03.860
While driving a car?

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:09.270
You get a green zone too, if you drive in
that green zone, you will be able to save

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.330
much, you are told.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:19.490
The problem is you can only go faster and
faster and faster… but you are sacrificing

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.510
something else.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:27.610
As you go faster and faster, yes, there is
a trip meter.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:35.230
How much farther you can go, how far you have
come… that meter that shows that data.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:43.120
Every car driver knows, he sacrifices, she
sacrifices, the duration for which they can

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:48.260
keep on driving when they go beyond a particular
speed limit.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.320
You sacrifice distance for speed.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:58.309
Oh.. there is a big daddy meter above, that
is even more important!

00:26:58.309 --> 00:27:00.789
Lifetime distance driven!

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:02.380
Do you want to go far?

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.799
Or do you want to go fast?

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.320
That is the Closing Thought!

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:14.000
I heard that it is an African proverb, but
not really from Africa!

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.809
“If you want to go fast, go alone.

00:27:18.809 --> 00:27:23.580
If you want to go far, go together!”

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.659
So, probably, the best cure for burnout, is
that togetherness!

00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:31.860
Get a partner.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.860
Get a husband.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.860
Get a wife.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.860
Get a manager.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.190
Get a friend.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.980
Get a colleague.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.620
Share.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.054
Probably they are waiting for 
you to ask!

00:27:43.054 --> 00:27:44.724
Avoid burnout.

00:27:44.724 --> 00:27:46.393
Thank you!
