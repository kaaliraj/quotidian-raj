00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:07.009
A few years ago, this was a big rage on Netflix.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.290
Orange is the new black!

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.520
That “new black” is a reference to fashion
clothing.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.250
Black is a colour that goes with any other
color!

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.250
Orange?

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.250
The color of jail-uniform.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.290
You may have heard of this too — Data is
the new Oil!

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.130
Once upon a time, they used to say “Oil
is the new Gold”.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.900
And, now, if you have data, you are almost
all-powerful, that is the message of that

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900
phrase.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.550
Data, is the new oil!

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.960
This one, our Seth Godin called it “Small
is the new big!”

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.600
He said startups today can actually, … really
thumb their nose at a very large enterprise..

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600
With agility!

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.920
He penned a full book on that philosophy!

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.500
Recently though, I came across this book.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.320
This book is called The Book of Beautiful
Questions.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.490
And, guess what the message of this book is?!

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.729
Mr Warren Berger, the author, says:- “Questions
are the new answers!”

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.729
Shocked?

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:32.970
Shall we explore it a bit more?

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.270
Namaste!

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230
Four hundred and twenty one!

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.550
The King of Questions.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.740
Or the Queen!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.230
We have talked in quite a few episodes about
Questioning and the importance of it.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:03.610
But there were a few things that I wanted
to dwell deeper on, and that is what we are

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.500
going to do today!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.209
Are you able to make sense of these words
here?

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:18.400
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.939
Yes, Harry Potter, the first book, the Sorcerer’s
Stone!

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.159
In that book, there is a mirror that is featured.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.159
The Mirror of Erised.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:36.370
And, it doesn’t just show an image of whoever
stands in front of them, but, instead, shows

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.689
their deepest desires, what they wish for
deep in their heart.

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:53.810
But, I remember something from this scene
that is EVEN MORE lovable than this beautiful

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.989
plot twist.

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.169
A conversation.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.129
Between Dumbledore and Harry Potter.

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.189
“Professor Dumbledore, Can I ask you something?”

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.019
And the professor would respond with, “Didn’t
you notice?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.049
You’ve already done that!”

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.989
(There is a question sitting right there in
the “Can I”, you see!)

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.629
“But, my dear, you may ask me one more question!”

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.949
Whenever I recall that scene, I tell myself,
this is the most important task for any teacher

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:23.959
towards their student!

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.889
To encourage the student to ask one more question!

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:38.480
It’s almost as if Dumbledore is giving Harry
the permission for lifelong learning!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.480
Ask One More!

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.499
That scene is etched in my mind!

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.370
There is a famous website called Stackoverflow.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.239
Many programmers, developers, engineers, visit
it regularly!

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.359
It is almost as if it is their internal Google.

00:03:53.359 --> 00:04:00.319
If Stackoverflow is down, these guys may even
want to take a break, they will feel like

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.569
their arms are tied behind their back!

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.569
Such a website!

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.819
Why is it so important?

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.829
Well, this is like Quora, you can ask any
question in tech-matters, and you are likely

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.380
to get a good answer, very soon.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.060
There are many answering sites like this one,
but why is Stackoverflow so famous?

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.980
The answer lies in the community.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.880
The way they have set it up, they even have
a set of guidelines on how to ask good questions!

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.760
When I look at those guidelines, I get the
feeling that these are more generally applicable

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760
too..

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.280
They can be used as guidelines for asking
questions in real life too!

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.950
Just take a look at these!

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.950
The first guideline?

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.950
Provide a context!

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.820
If you are going to ask something of somebody,
give them the context.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.040
Why, who, when, where, what, … How did that
question come up?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.240
Give them that context.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.979
What domain, what surrounding environment,
is this question a central part of?

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.080
The person you are targeting must first understand
that!

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.600
Don’t just hit them like a bolt from the
blue!

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.740
The second requirement we have is, “Tell
us why you are asking that question!”

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.760
That is because, more often than not, newcomers,
beginners, newbies, they ask questions that

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.710
don’t actually require just an answer…
the answerer has to spend time wondering why

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.710
such a question came up in the first place,
and try answering the bigger problem “upstream”.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.310
Sometimes, the question has to be unasked,
they say!

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:44.710
So, tell us why you are asking that this question,
because, sometimes, we may have to drill deeper,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.900
bark up the tree, and fix it for you.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.370
And then, they say, Share the Research!

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.110
“Where all did you go before coming here?

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.520
What doors did you try knocking down?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.890
What responses did you get there?

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.330
What attempts did you make?

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.480
What didn’t apply?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.500
What results did you see?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.500
What went wrong?”

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.500
Why are they asking this?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.390
Why are they asking you to tell what went
wrong and what else you tried before coming

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.840
to them?

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.130
That’s because they want you to earn the
right to ask a question.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.320
In Stackoverflow, you can’t just sign up,
and start asking a question!

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.510
You need to earn your chops!

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.030
You are wasting my time, aren’t you?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.470
I am an answerer..

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.240
You are wasting my time, and so, have you
spent an equivalent amount of time trying

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.900
to get at the answer yourself?

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.080
Give me proof!

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.200
Are you able to see that some of these can
actually be applied to real life too?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.470
If you want to broaden the scope that we just
saw from Stackoverflow, you can go to a book

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.320
titled “The Art of Asking!”

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:06.250
In that book, the author talks about seven
things you need to check, through introspection,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.240
before asking the question.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.290
What are those seven things?

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.530
What data are you going in search of?

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.660
What is it you are looking for?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.830
And.., are you specific enough?

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:32.360
Are you on a fishing expedition or are you
here, looking for this, because of this, … are

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.590
you specific?

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.400
Then, are you specific as well about the time?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.810
I need it by this time..

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.600
If I get it AFTER this timeline, it is as
good as useless…This is the reason I need

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.620
it by this time, etc..

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.300
Is there a timeliness to it..?

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.790
Should you have asked this question earlier?

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:56.120
Or should you have waited for a better opportunity
for this question to be asked?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.260
These are questions you need to ask yourself?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.450
Who are you asking it to?

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.150
Is this the person who owns the answer?

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:11.770
Is this the person or group of persons who
are the right people to answer it for you?

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:17.200
Don’t shoot the messenger — remember?!

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.930
What are the implications?

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.630
Because you have asked this question, what
are the side-effects?

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.370
What are the after-effects?

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.660
Did you spend some thought before asking this
question?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.979
How about, what manner you are adopting to
ask this question?

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:39.519
There are SO MANY different ways to ask the
same thing!

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.419
How was the movie? — is a neutral question.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.620
Wasn’t it amazing?

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.329
— Is a loaded way to ask it.

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:46.689
It was no good, was it?

00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:47.839
— Is a pre-loaded negative question!

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:50.810
Are you asking it the right way?

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.699
And finally, this is my clincher…

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:59.829
what is the response you have for a kind of
answer that might come!?

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:03.600
If the person says I don’t know, do you
have a response?

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.240
If the person gives an answer, which doesn’t
look like a good answer, what is your response?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.720
That.. those are the seven things you need
to keep in mind.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.899
You need to ask yourself!

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:20.939
When we talk about “asking yourself”,
I am reminded of this MacGuffin Quotidian

00:09:20.939 --> 00:09:22.350
we did — in Q322.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.350
Kuberakkuppai.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.350
The MacGuffin.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:32.819
In it, we talked about something unique and
specific called Rubberducking.

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:33.819
What is that?

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:40.660
Well, if you are planning to approach a genius,
or an expert, or a busy person, before you

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:46.379
go with your question… a professor even
implemented this as an experiment, outside

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:47.699
his office room..

00:09:47.699 --> 00:09:52.730
Before you reach his desk, there is another
desk where there is a rubber duck or a teddy

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.949
bear.

00:09:53.949 --> 00:10:00.470
The student or the person in the quest for
the answer, is supposed to sit at the desk,

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.529
look at the rubber duck, and tell the problem
to the duck!

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:08.769
Does it look insulting??

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:09.769
Nope!

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:16.540
It respects you, it respects the expert, because
the answer comes out, more often than not!

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.990
During the time you take to explain it carefully
to the duck, .. you will stop halfway, for

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.509
suddenly you are going to realise that the
answer has dawned on you!

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:31.709
And, there are scientific explanations too,
why rubberducking really works!

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:34.160
There are four reasons!

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.930
One, you tend to slow down when you talk.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.310
When you verbalise.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.449
Thoughts run very fast!

00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:43.029
They are the horses of your imagination.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:44.029
But, speech?

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:45.550
They are tortoises in comparison.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.749
They will move very slowly.

00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:55.410
When you slow yourself down, because the mouth
and the tongue is slowing your play of words

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:02.800
coming from your thoughts, automatically,
remember System II thinking from Daniel Kahneman?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.839
That takes over, and System II, we all know,
is the subconscious.

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.490
Much smarter!

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.220
And answers that have been staring us in our
face all along, answers that have been ignored

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.970
till now, will finally come in front of you!

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.000
Secondly, there is this ELI5 effect.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.490
Explain Like I’m Five effect.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:29.749
To a little child, without using any jargon,
when you make it dead simple, you realise

00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:34.800
the answer is actually hidden in the words
of your question.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.800
When talking to an expert, you don’t do
that.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.910
You don’t oversimplify.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.269
The third reason is, you are talking to a
computer!

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:53.199
And, that is why, when you are facing a programming
bug, you are stuck.. unable to solve it.

00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:57.529
What is the point talking to a human being
about a problem that came up when you were

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:00.750
talking to a computer?!

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.480
Talk to another inanimate object instead!

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.149
That is another reason why it works.

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:09.100
Talking to an inanimate object…

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.699
what is the biggest benefit in doing so?

00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:13.730
They don’t interrupt you!

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.540
Most of the time, when you talk, the other
person is waiting for an opportunity to talk.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.019
The other person is waiting to find mistakes
in the way you talk!

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:28.679
When you talk to a rubber duck, it has infinite
patience, it is listening to you, and it is

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:32.430
ready to make you spill the answer yourself!

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:38.129
So, these are the four reasons why they say
rubberducking works so well!

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:46.420
So, probably, before you go out with a question,
go IN, with that question!

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:52.300
Seth Godin, in this book — This is Marketing
— has this to say.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.279
He says, “People don’t want what you make…

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:03.399
(I hope you remember the quarter-inch-drill-bit!)

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:06.810
That’s not what they are coming to you for!

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:11.079
They are coming to you for loftier emotions.

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:12.240
Like?

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:20.480
Like belonging, connection, peace of mind,
status symbols,..

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:30.389
You need to look at your product as simply
a vehicle or a device to trigger those emotions

00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:31.639
in your customer’s mind.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:35.429
So, don’t get lost in the tactics.

00:13:35.429 --> 00:13:40.529
Losing sight of the true interest the customer
has!”

00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:49.689
And, he goes on to say, “Ask these two questions
all the time, about the product you are building.

00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:52.410
Simple straightforward questions.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.899
Who is it for?

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:56.040
And, what does it do for them?”

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.420
A few days ago, on Whatsapp, I received this
interesting message.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.759
You must have seen it too.

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:02.910
Policemen in Netherlands.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.910
In Eindhoven.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.910
Do you remember?

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.910
A story accompanied this photo.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:11.230
The story went thus:- “After a woman was
taken to the hospital with hypoglycemia (low

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:19.080
blood sugar), two policemen stayed behind
to prepare dinner for the five kids who were

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.399
still in the house.

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.839
Afterwards, they also did the dishes.”

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:29.529
The policemen could have thought, “My job?

00:14:29.529 --> 00:14:40.949
I am 

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:56.089
a policeman, I am here to chase thieves, and
maintain law and order..”

00:14:56.089 --> 00:14:57.869
Who am I for?

00:14:57.869 --> 00:14:59.269
What does it do for them?

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:02.279
— Those two questions from Seth Godin.

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:08.300
If they had deliberated deeply about it, they
may have arrived at..

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.810
“Who am I?

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:16.709
I am here to protect and to serve.

00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:17.709
What is “protect”?

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:21.749
Doesn’t mean one needs protection only when
there’s a knife to the neck!

00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:26.620
Protect can also mean a life-threatening health
situation with nobody else around to help!

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.100
That is Protect too.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.100
Children!

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.290
Providing dinner for them!

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.329
That is to Serve.

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:36.000
Cleaning the dishes!

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.360
Probably Serve!

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.749
So, ask those two questions — Who is it
for?

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:44.360
What does it do for them?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:52.129
If you look at a Teacher-Student relationship,
there are three levels again, in questioning.

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:56.170
At the first level, the ANSWER is important.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.420
Square root of two — If that question is
asked, the answer..

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.129
So, those kinds of questions are asked because
the answer is important.

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:13.050
The second level is the kind of question that
is asked because the QUESTION is important.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:20.899
If the square root of 16 is 4, and the square
root of 4 is 2, .. what is the square root

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:25.750
of 2… suddenly the question becomes important.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.220
Why?

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.259
It is not a proper nice fraction.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:33.259
It is irrational.

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:38.939
When that thought strikes you, you are dragged
in the direction of, “Hey, What is irrationality?!”

00:16:38.939 --> 00:16:47.329
So, here, the question is more important than
the fifth decimal after the decimal point

00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:49.449
in the expansion of the square root of two.

00:16:49.449 --> 00:16:50.449
Is it not?

00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:51.589
There is a third level.

00:16:51.589 --> 00:17:00.410
And, the third level is the kind of question
that is asked because the PROCESS of questioning

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.439
is important..

00:17:01.439 --> 00:17:02.439
Question everything!

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:09.020
It is the person who asks SUCH questions goes
on to the square root of zero, and asks, what

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.579
is the square root of -1??!

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:20.260
So, question everything, is what leads to
true wisdom!

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:26.689
If we hook these back to our favourite words,
Questions asked because the ANSWER is important

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:28.930
— is the WHAT.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.130
What is the square root of sixteen?

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.440
Questions asked because the QUESTION is important
— is the WHY.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.170
Why are irrational numbers different from
rational ones?

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:47.280
Questions asked because the PROCESS is important
— is the HOW.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.090
Where the aim is only to ask questions, and
hope clarity arrives.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:59.730
On Netflix, there is this beautiful series
called Tales by Light.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:05.690
Photographers talk about their various adventures.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.780
There is a particular episode titled Himalaya.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:15.890
In The Himalayas, in Bhutan, monks, Buddhist
monks, how they improve their understanding,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:20.860
how they expand their learning about Buddhism,
is beautifully picturised.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.220
It almost looks like they are fighting, doesn’t
it?

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.300
A monk is seated.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.640
Another is standing in front of them.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.640
They argue about complex concepts.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.430
Simple philosophies.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:46.890
And, what is so beautiful is, after this session
is over, they change places.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:56.440
Whoever was talking FOR a particular topic,
takes a completely different viewpoint, and

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.960
starts fighting against!

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:03.800
A great way to lower your ego, the senior
monks say!

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.400
The process.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.790
The act of Questioning.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.550
Asking because ASKING is important.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.120
Not because I am in search of anything else.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.220
Asking is what I believe is my guide.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:26.540
If I do that, I am confident that freedom
and deliverance await me on the other side!

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.860
Closing thought.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.070
This guy, Warren Berger, has written two books.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.380
One, we already saw, The Book of Beautiful
Questions.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.870
But, before that one, he had written another.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.820
A More Beautiful Question.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.380
Some questions that were asked in the “More
Beautiful Question” book, required explaining.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:54.910
And, that’s why I wrote the second book,
the author says.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.710
In the foreword for the books, he makes a
comment: “There is an entomologist…

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.200
He researches about insects and flies.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.810
Then, there is an archaeologist..

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.280
She researches about old buildings and artifacts.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.280
But… questions?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.660
Is there a person who researches them?

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.220
Is there a term for such people?

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.220
Nope.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.460
Couldn’t find any.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.610
So, I decided to concoct a word all by myself.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.890
I decided to call myself a Questionologist.”

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:35.000
He closes by saying, (and it pains me to hear
it!):- “I called myself the Questionologist.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.270
And started going around with a visiting card
saying that.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.570
I started printing books that introduced me
with that title.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.070
But, guess what?

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:53.100
Nobody asked me why I was calling myself a
Questionologist!”

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.820
What a problem!!

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:02.960
Let us meet again next week!

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.000
Thank you!
