00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.650
Namaste!

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.800
Love!

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.950
Hate!

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.730
A game called About Love, Hate, and the Other
Ones…

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.110
I LOVE that game!

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.180
Watch a scene from this gameplay!

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.100
This character keeps saying “I hate you”!

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.870
This other character keeps saying “I love
you”!

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.649
I love you, I love you!

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.049
One person pushes the others away because
of hatred, while the other draws people towards

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.350
them with their love..!

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.649
A game, just using these mechanics!

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.979
Love, Hate!

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:04.500
In fact, if you google for “Opposite of
Love”, you will see words like hate, loathe,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500
detest.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.960
From the Oxford Dictionaries.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.572
But, my question is, is it really?

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:16.810
Is Hate the opposite of Love?

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.150
My dad used to scold me much!

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.490
I will really “get it” from him!

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.980
After all is said and done though, he will
call me, hug me, and tell me: “That kid

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.690
going on the street?

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.800
That stranger kid?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.640
Who is making all those mistakes?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.820
Do I even care?

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.580
I don’t care!

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.670
So, I am not giving that person advice.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.550
I am not scolding him.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.860
You, my son, I care for you.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.690
I scold you BECAUSE I love you!”

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.250
As a kid, I didn’t get the logic of that
argument too well.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090
Apple launched an amazing ad quite some time
ago.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.390
Part of the “Think Different” campaign
launched by Steve Jobs, decades ago.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.260
It is a long advertisement, running for nearly
30 seconds.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.049
The message would be something like, “You
can quote them, disagree with them, glorify

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.680
them or vilify them.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.489
About the only thing you can’t do?

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.180
Is ignore them!

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.049
You can love them, you can hate them, but
you cannot IGNORE them!

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.150
Because they are the people who are going
to change the way the world is going to operate!

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.090
They are the challengers!

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.362
They are the rebels with a cause!

00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:37.870
So, the opposite of LOVE, many of us wrongly
think it to be HATE.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.590
But no!

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.620
The opposite of LOVE is INDIFFERENCE.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.879
Like rain off the back of a domestic buffalo.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:53.540
It is like saying, I don’t care whether
it is Rama Rajya or rule by Ravana himself!

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.540
Why would that be?

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.049
Well, the greatest gifts one can give?

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.819
There are two gifts that every person can
give!

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.760
Attention and Time.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.360
I am choosing to not distract my brain into
focusing on other things, and I am dedicating

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.849
my attention towards you.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.840
The other is, Time.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.319
My time, instead of spending it on something
else, I am keeping all that away, I am with

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.319
you!

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.879
So, watching a movie, reading a book, listening
to a song, spending time with a wife, a husband,

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.659
a kid, a friend… buying a product, all of
these are about time and attention.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.659
Just these two gifts!

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.659
Greatest gifts!

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.659
It is not money!

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:38.659
These two gifts!

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:46.489
So, only if you are giving these two gifts,
can you either LOVE or HATE.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:56.930
The others, who say, “I don’t respect
you enough to even think of giving you these

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.819
two gifts” will just act indifferently.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.010
That is why, we see the trio, Love, Hate,
Indifference.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.819
That is why NOTA was born too.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.040
It is good for a politician to win.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.889
It is okay for a politician to lose too.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:19.989
But, when a voter chooses NOTA, none of the
above, choosing to vote neither for one politician

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.130
nor for the other?

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.930
I don’t even approve of this system, I don’t
care who wins.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.320
That is their stance.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.430
Love me or hate me, but spare me your indifference!

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.670
I am here, in front of you!

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.060
Towering above you!

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.380
Can’t you feel my presence?!

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.160
Are you going to ignore me?!

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
That is that indifferent attitude.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160
They have researched about this matter.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.300
Around ten years ago, there was this research
done about the brain.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.970
In a university in the United Kingdom.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.010
Two parts of the brain, marked in red here,
they are called Putamen and Insula..

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.760
They tracked which parts of the brain lit
up in magnetic resonance imaging, when a person

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.740
was REALLY HATING something.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.880
They tracked which parts of the brain lit
up when a person was REALLY ROMANTICALLY LOVING

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.880
something.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.880
Surprise!

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.350
Both the regions were the same!

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.190
It is the same protective, antagonistic attitude,
that is triggered in extreme hate and in extreme

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.190
love!

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.510
That is the finding of that research.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.930
Many people fall for this common myth.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.460
They think there is LOVE at one side of the
spectrum.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.770
And far away on the other side, there is HATE.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.770
Two extremes.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.970
A person is either here or there.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.110
But, that belief has been proven to be unfounded.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:48.710
The current understanding is, Love may be
an extreme, Hatred may be the other extreme,

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.690
but they are actually quite close to each
other, and the third thing that is far away

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.500
from both of these is the Indifferent Attitude.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.950
If you do some research about Apple, for example,
some customer research, the fellow who LOVES

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.270
Apple, if you ask them why, they may quote
two reasons.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:14.270
Pick the other person, who really HATES it,
if you ask them why, they may end up quoting

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.240
the VERY SAME two reasons!

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.490
Similarly for Ilaiyaraaja’s music, the same
reasons that make a person like it may end

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.680
up being the reasons somebody else doesn’t
like it!

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.920
That’s the beauty there!

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.740
So, if you want to convert your customers,
the one thing you need to do is — let them

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.430
love you, let them hate you, but just ensure
they are not indifferent towards you.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.710
Just ensure they don’t say “I don’t
care if you exist.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.880
Or, if you don’t exist!”

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.490
Thiruvalluvar himself has talked about it.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.580
In Kural 360, he has touched upon the concept.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.070
Kaamam veguli mayakkkam ivmoonran naamam kedakkedum
noi.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.280
That is, “Don’t love, don’t hate, don’t
be ignorant.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:09.580
If you are going to be stuck in either of
these three, you are going to be defeated

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.330
by the diseases of life.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.570
If you want to escape from these three, do
not love, do not hate, don’t stay ignorant”.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.590
Thus went the interesting twist he gave to
it.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:27.770
So, beware of the indifferent customer, indifferent
lover, indifferent son or daughter, indifferent

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.790
friend or enemy!

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.280
Thank you!
