00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:08.910
In the Western countries, there is this two-party
game. There is this Liberal, and the Conservative.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.400
They would use terms like Democrats and Republicans.
One is modern and progressive, and the other

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:24.070
is traditional and conservative. In fact,
Churchill made this very interesting observation.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.360
He said, "If you are not a liberal at twenty,
you have no heart. And, if you're not a conservative,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:41.250
when you grow older, forty, you have no brain"!
Which is the right attitude to have? Should

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:51.090
we have both??
(Intro Music)

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:07.610
Namaste!
This person's name is Jon Postel. Jon Postel

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.840
is so famous as the father of the internet
(What is the Internet? An interconnection

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.930
of networks..) He is so famous as the Father
of the Internet that they even made a meme

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.211
out of this "professor teaching" photograph.
There is actually something like this! It

00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:39.480
said, "If the Net does have a God, it is probably
Jon Postel". So, what DID he do, why did he

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.750
become so famous? Well, to get at the answer,
you will have to roll back time to forty years

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.070
ago. The time when the internet was just being
born. A time when even the Web wasn't born

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.790
yet. There were all kinds of different networks
all over the place.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.100
This is actually the number of networks. There
was an LCSNet, an EDNNet, a ClarkNet, an ARPANet,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:11.420
a COMSat, a Nullnet, a FiberNet, a BITNet…
Each talking its own language. Each, thinking

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.980
they are the best! And, somebody else is coming
along and saying, let's all work together,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.010
who should give in, why should we, aren't
we better… that was the bickering that was

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.600
happening all around at that time, and Jon
Postel came up with a beautiful principle.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:40.660
Today, it is even called Jon Postel's Law.
He called it The Robustness Principle. What

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.380
does Robustness mean? In plain terms, this
is what it is.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.560
He said, "Be conservative in what you, and
be liberal in what you accept from others".

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.930
When a network tries to communicate with another
network, let what you speak out be a little

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.390
rule-bound always. But, if the others break
the rules, bend the rules, fragment, deface,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.380
and twist it in any manner, try and be liberal
and understand it to the extent possible.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:19.320
This simple principle can be pinpointed for
the real reason that made the internet possible.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.010
Some of the greatest principles have this
unique quality. They are applicable outside

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.340
their original domain. Beyond what it was
originally applicable for, beyond where it

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.200
was originally proposed, these principles
seem to transcend, they become applicable

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.540
and useful elsewhere too, they snap into place
like a glove, that is a hallmark of a great

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.801
principle.&nbsp;
For example, take a look at this page. This

00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:59.930
is a web page about web pages. Incidentally,
this web page is the oldest web page on the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.890
World Wide Web. In the 1990s.. When Tim Berners
Lee was architecting the original web, this

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.140
was the first page he created for the web!
Oldest web page. HTML 1.0. If, even this oldest

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:20.090
page is viewable today, by modern browsers,
it is only because of this Robustness Principle.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.600
Send me anything you want, I will liberally
accept it, and I will somehow manage to show

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.500
you something that might make sense… but,
when I show you something, when I output something,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.740
it will be grammatically correct, accurate,
conservative. That is the robustness principle.&nbsp;

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.490
When it comes to English, people always wonder.
Why is it so popular? Wherever you turn, you

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.850
see that English has become the most powerful,
the most popular. Did you know there are as

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.780
many as 350 different languages and dialects
that have contributed words into the English

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:11.740
vocabulary? By one measure, as much as forty
percent of the words in the English language

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.000
are borrowed words, it seems. Dig a little
further, explore the Latin and Roman roots

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.810
of the language, and you realise that eighty
percent, a full eighty percent, that is, four

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:38.120
out of every five words in English, are borrowed!
Liberal in accepting from others, conservative

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.600
in what you do.
Which is why it pains me a little bit, when

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.300
I look at Tamil. I see a lot of efforts underway
to modernise Tamil, to make it relevant to

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.830
today's day and age, and to proudly tell the
world about its ancient heritage and greatness.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.370
But, when a programmer is programming, if
that programmer encounters "Payanpaattu Niralaakka

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:11.430
Idaimugam", I don't know if that is adding
value to her. She sees API, and API makes

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.720
sense even if she is not an English speaker.
But, payanpaattu niralaakka idaimugam, sounds

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.720
a little too contrived. Done just for the
sake of it. Why not we be liberal in what

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.240
we accept from others, conservative in what
we give.&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:41.800
&nbsp;This image, many of you may recall. It is
a freeware tool, called IrfanView. It is probably

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:52.670
one of the most famous freeware tools on the
web. To watch, view, render, play, any kind

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:57.340
of visual media. Could be an image. Could
be in one of many formats. Just look at the

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.729
list. So many different formats. You can choose
any of those formats, throw any version of

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:12.410
those formats at it, as many as 75 or 80 different
formats, it says, No problem, I can render

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:18.100
it. Liberal at what it accepts from others.
That is one of the reasons for its fame. If

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:28.110
it is so globally popular, it is because its
creator, Irfan is his name, he took the effort

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:35.160
to make it accept anything that is thrown
at it. Conservative in what it gives out.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.400
If you try Save command on it, there may perhaps
be three formats to save the image in. But

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.870
what does it accept? Seventy-five / eighty
different formats.&nbsp;

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:51.500
You would have bumped into this everywhere,
by now. QR Code. Quick Response Code, it is

00:07:51.500 --> 00:08:00.100
called. You have it in PayTM. You Pay. PhonePe.
Google Pay. You find it inside everything.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:09.030
Did you know that you can actually hold your
phone upside down to scan a QR Code? The three

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:15.240
large squares in three of its corners, and
the little square in the fourth corner are

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.910
enough to tell the camera that is scanning
it what orientation it is in. Even if you

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:29.610
scan it completely upside down on purpose,
"No problem, I will adjust". It contains error-correction,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:37.469
it contains a sense of robustness. It is liberal
in what it accepts from you and me. That is

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:47.199
why it is famous.
On Google, if you search for a word, perhaps

00:08:47.199 --> 00:08:52.129
"Quotidain" - instead of Quotidian, have
you noticed that it doesn't say that this

00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:58.360
word doesn't exist? It instead switches to
the most common equivalent, probably you committed

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.230
a typing mistake, in your eagerness to watch
Quotidians, and it agrees, and says no problem,

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:12.720
I will show this to you, and if you really
wanted that, take a look. Robustness and liberality

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:20.010
in accepting whatever you throw at it.&nbsp;
You can stretch this same concept into team

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:28.970
management and family interactions too. In
a family, in a group, in a team, in a company,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:35.100
in an organisation, each person, they will
come to you with their own biases, their own

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:45.170
agendas, their own points of view.. If you
have to shepherd all of them in one direction,

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.430
if you have to understand each of their opinions,
and judiciously, meaningfully, respond to

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:56.459
them, then, it makes sense to accept liberally
whatever they come up with. One of them may

00:09:56.459 --> 00:10:01.999
draw it out for you. Another may speak it
out in a loud voice. Another may want to send

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:10.649
it to you only in writing. One more person
may speak volumes with her silence! Be liberal!

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:18.350
But, when you finalise, and come out with
your message, your conclusion, your summary,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:24.550
make it so that it follows a certain grammar,
and everybody around understands what you

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:30.639
are trying to say.
Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity - in

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:35.709
Kolkata - there is folklore that its walls
sport a quotation by her. A poetry. Beautiful

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:42.580
poetry. Many would have surely heard about
it. I am not going to read through it word

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:53.300
by word. But, for example, it says "If you
are kind, people may accuse you of ulterior

00:10:53.300 --> 00:11:01.820
motives. Be kind anyway." Similarly, forgive
them anyway. Be honest anyway. And so on and

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:09.369
on. The poem is titled "Anyway!". A beautiful,
emotionally loaded message. This is what life

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:17.610
is. This is how the world is. Be conservative
in how you treat them. Be liberal in what

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:28.179
you accept from them. That is the recurrent
theme. Postel's Law. A concept that goes far

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:36.290
beyond everything that we have seen till now.
A concept that is probably worth its weight

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:41.569
in gold. No wonder it is the God of the Internet
who has given us that law.

00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:47.989
As a closing thought, I was researching about
this, and I stumbled across something very

00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:55.889
interesting. While recalling the memory of
Mother Teresa, let us not forget the contribution

00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:02.949
by Dr. Kent Keith too! He is still alive,
but, when he was a college kid, way back in

00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:11.920
the seventies, at Harvard, he had come up
with this poem, this Anyway poem. It is he

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.449
who had originally penned it. The same repetitive
theme - Anyway, Anyway, Anyway, he had

00:12:16.449 --> 00:12:21.899
published it in his college magazine. And
then, he had forgotten all about it, and become

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:26.489
famous for other things. Many decades later,
in a meeting, somebody had brought this up

00:12:26.489 --> 00:12:29.850
and wanted to read a poem by Mother Teresa.
And, it immediately flashed in his mind that

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:44.369
these were HIS words! What did he do? He was
conservative in saying - I recall having

00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:53.230
written this poem. He didn't sue the Mother!
He was also liberal in assigning credit to

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.779
the great Mother Teresa. Did the great Mother
Teresa choose to publish this poem in the

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:05.820
walls of her orphanage? Wow! I feel so humbled
and proud! And he had moved on!

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:15.610
So, be conservative in trying to steal credit.
Be liberal in giving away credit.&nbsp;

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.079
Thank you!
