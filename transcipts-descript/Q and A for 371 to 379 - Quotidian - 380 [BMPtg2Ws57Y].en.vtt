00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.070
Namaste!

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.310
Three hundred and eighty!

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.310
Once again, an opportunity to look back, questions,
opinions, complaints, … accusations!

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.680
Let us see!

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.060
I was unwell..

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.610
I have missed the videos you had sent me..

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.340
I will ensure I watch them regularly from
now on.. said a friend.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.980
This is just a sample of some of the unexpected
love that our viewers are showing me.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.410
Almost like a family member, almost like a
big brother, or a friend, it is truly heartening,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.660
when I read the messages they send me.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.180
Another person hit me with this!

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.449
This gap.. seems to have become a bit too
long.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.880
It would be much better if you did this a
bit more frequently…

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.880
And, guess who this was?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.390
The same person, who, not too long ago, said,
“You are sending it daily!

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.100
And, I am not able to handle the load!”

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Same person!

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.470
I don’t know what to do!

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.600
Seriously!

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.950
Another friend wrote to me and said, “This
is more manageable.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.990
Your original schedule was a bit unfair on
those who joined in a bit late.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.650
But now, thanks to you, I am able to catch
up.”

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:43.430
So, yes, it is a push and pull between consistency,
regularity and accommodating the distracted

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.430
world we live in.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.860
“There is too much stuff out there, I can’t
handle you daily!” says a group, on one

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.860
side.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.149
And, another group, on the other side, demanding
that I give them more!

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.570
There is a good dynamic tension, if you know
what I mean.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.329
One person complained about the Mother Teresa
pose that I had used in one of my thumbnails.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.920
“I personally feel it’s wrong, do you
really know who she was?” — and he went

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.620
on to bring a political / religious touch
to the conversation.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.010
Please get this.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.520
There is no connection or correlation whatsoever
between this Quotidian series and those concepts.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520
At all.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.910
So, you need not be concerned or worried that
I will talk politics or religion.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.110
I don’t know much about it.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.960
I am not interested in that.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.650
If that’s what you are here for, you are
in the wrong place.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.450
Here is another comment.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.880
“In Quotidian 370, you had talked about
a productivity trick, and I have been waiting

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.920
since then, but you haven’t announced it,
why…!” they wanted to know.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.959
I think it was Mahatma Gandhi, they used to
tell this story about him.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.691
There was this little boy who ate a lot of
sweets.

00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:03.829
His Mom brings the kid over to the Mahatma
and asks him to give the boy some good advice.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.700
But, Gandhiji asks the Mom to bring the kid
over after fifteen days.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.950
And, promptly, after fifteen days, when the
child is brought again, he advises the boy

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.150
with a simple and short “Dear Child, Do
not binge on sweets!”

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.250
The mother asks him respectfully, “Why couldn’t
you tell this on that day?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.690
Why did you make me wait fifteen days?”

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.060
To which, the Mahatma is supposed to have
responded: “The advice is easy to give.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.150
But, the implementation…

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.030
To follow that advice is hard.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.080
Am I able to follow my own advice?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.840
I am struggling with it myself…

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.190
I wanted to test it out myself first.”

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.380
Exactly the same sentiment here.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.260
I am testing it out.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.670
I hit upon something very interesting.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.040
But, before I share it with you, I am testing
it out.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.980
Closed beta phase, you could call it.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.610
Davos wrote to me and commented about my dress.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.590
“What’s up with your dress, something
fell on it?

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.190
Is there a story behind it?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.919
It looks a bit sweaty..!”

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.979
Yes, I am shooting it in a place where there
is no good airconditioning.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.720
And summer is approaching, you see…

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.400
You may be in Davos, .. lucky you!

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.800
Rohith Kumar asked me — “How can I become
like you… bookreading?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.110
Or meditation?

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.580
Or what should I do sir?”

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.320
First of all, I am not some bigshot who deserves
being asked questions like “How should I

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320
become like you”…

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.430
Secondly, if you would allow me to use your
own words and play around a bit…

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.590
it is not “bookreading” OR “meditation”..

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.730
Look at it as “meditating about the books
you read”.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.960
I will repeat.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:56.830
Rather than read ten different books on a
specific subject, read one book on that subject

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.830
TEN TIMES.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.340
Recently, I read a book where I chanced upon
this beautiful, interesting, advice.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.120
Because, every time you read that book, something
more will sink in, and, a new dimension, a

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.410
new perspective, you may hit upon.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.090
Rather than browse around in a desultory,
superficial fashion, probably it is better

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.040
to dwell deep and analyse well.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.260
Rajavelu told me about this thumbnail, and
said he couldn’t understand this thumbnail.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.130
Looks like there is a knife through your heart,
there is a lot of bleeding…

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.770
I understood the video, once I watched it,
but the thumbnail, I couldn’t grasp it…

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.770
he said.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.940
Oh, one little bit about these thumbnails,
my dear Rajavelu.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.570
I just try to pick something in the video,
something that I have spoken, something that

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.270
I have shown, and picturise it in an interesting
manner.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.570
That’s all.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.990
A little creative liberty there.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.790
So, if you look at this video, for example,
there is this story of a guy who has a chip

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.910
embedded near his heart, and that chip contains
a code…

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.850
And that was the reason for this thumbnail.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.680
Shine and Glow — the poet or poetess that
that person is, shared with me something really

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.190
interesting about beauty.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:23.860
She referred to the natural fact of the watermelon
not hanging down from up in a tree as something

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.860
truly beautiful!

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.860
Very interesting!

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:34.730
Blender Forever helped us all by saying, “Oh,
here are the upcoming numbers and the corresponding

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.730
dates.”

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.840
Q375–8th February, Q376, Q377, and so on.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.680
That’s when I realised that probably some
of you missed what the whole game was about.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.590
Why is it seemingly random?

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.460
When will the next Quotidian be released?

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.021
Is it not happening everyday like in 2021?

00:06:55.021 --> 00:07:00.350
Answers to such questions can be had if you
watch Quotidian — 369.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.950
I had explained it quite extensively there.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:08.990
I have explained there about when we are meeting
next.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.970
And you will understand that it is revolving
around the concept of Pi.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.970
That 22/7…

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.970
Or the irrational 3.1415…

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.889
The dates come based on that special sequence
in the value of Pi.

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:28.180
So, you will learn that the next meeting would
be on the 21st of March, and the one after

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.500
that on the 23rd of March.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.950
Sumitra asked me — I am still searching
for a leader..

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.380
I have seen many BOSSes.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.270
But, I am still looking for that leader.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.660
I want to turn that question back at her.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.680
I want to ask her — Have you been a good
follower?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.340
You keep asking for a leader..

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.860
But, have you been a good follower first?

00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:03.139
I think it was Vivekananda, Swami Vivekananda…
who said: “He who wants to lead or command,

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:05.020
must know how to obey”.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:11.190
I am thinking of publishing a Quotidian about
this very topic.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:22.340
What are the qualities that represent that
ideal second-in-command, that ideal person

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:29.620
who serves a leader, that ideal follower,
let’s see..

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.090
Arunkumar Jothilal said: I went around googling
for it, and that’s when I learned much.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:39.389
I looked at the etymology for the word and
noticed that the original meaning comes from

00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:40.630
Old English.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.630
Yes!

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.829
This is an amazing habit that you’ve got
going there.

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:46.070
It is a great hobby.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.110
Very interesting stuff…

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.921
When you look deeper into inscrutable matters,
inner meanings, and original etymology, it

00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:54.760
will suddenly plop on your lap unexpectedly!

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:07.170
Also, one more thing you can try is “The
same word, what was in French, what was in

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.170
Spanish”.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.720
That would be very interesting too.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.740
Try it!

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.089
We saw that Need For Speed.

00:09:14.089 --> 00:09:15.529
Should we go fast?

00:09:15.529 --> 00:09:17.339
Or… should we go slow?

00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:19.140
And that’s when this happened.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.330
We were trying to login to Facebook.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.650
And, Facebook showed us this beautiful prompt.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:32.010
It talked about how your account could be
secured, introduced a few steps, and had a

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.020
progress bar that slowly went, “Checking
your app passwords”.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:43.350
Don’t we know about how powerful the Facebook
servers are?

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.890
Don’t I know that there are not too many
App passwords to be checked?

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:53.470
But, if it rushes too fast, we wouldn’t
know what Facebook is doing..!

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:59.550
And, if it does it very fast, we will wonder
did it even do it at all?!

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:07.690
For THAT reason, consciously, artificially,
on purpose, it runs a slow progress bar, “See?

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.920
I am checking your passwords carefully, do
you get that?”

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.890
it seems to say.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.730
That was really really beautiful!

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:22.980
A friend pointed out to me about that guy
from Silicon Valley..

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.300
The guy who squats in front of his manager,
“Hmm, give me the stuff I asked you for!”.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.000
He referred to this persistent character in
the Raja Harishchandra story, by name Nakshatreyan,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.300
and wondered if he was the same kind of guy.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.300
Yes.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300
Correct!

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.870
It is Nakshatreyan!

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:43.899
He also told me that the number of Shlokas
that Lord Ganesha struggled to understand

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:44.899
the meaning of…

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:48.500
Seems there is an exact count of that — 8192!

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:57.310
Those were the number of shlokas that were
unusually hard so that Vyasa had time to cook

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.360
up the next one.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.460
Smart!

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.390
Surya Krishna wrote a long note to me.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.590
Please find the time to read it at leisure.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:11.460
But, it was basically about “Many people
have said many things about your Quotidians!

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.550
But, I would like to tell you about your thumbnails.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.110
They are really interesting.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.110
Thanks a lot.”

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.190
And he continued, “This video had a thumbnail.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.030
A shaved head sprouted a hair style!

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:28.420
You had a beautiful girl to pose along with
you too!”

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:36.360
That was when I realised that probably you
are all too young, or probably I am too old,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.660
and I am referring to a very old movie..

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.920
In fact, the first movie featuring John Travolta.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920
Called Grease.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:51.980
Perhaps it was this movie, Grease, that was
one of the first teenage love movies that

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.460
became such a roaring hit on the big screen.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.810
Watch it if you get the time.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.110
An interesting movie with a lot of good songs.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.580
And, it was from this movie that I picked
up the idea for the thumbnail.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.580
Why?

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.580
Well..

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.580
Grease.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.580
That means Frictionless.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.580
I hope you get the connection.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.730
Varadarasan appreciated me for the concept
of the Desire Path.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.970
And, he brought in a deeply philosophical
analogy from family life.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:23.170
He quipped that it was applicable even at
home where the wife and the mother-in-law

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:30.600
can actually work it out if only there was
an accommodation of the Desire Path.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.839
I thought about it a bit more.

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.839
Such an interesting thought.

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:35.990
Let us take it further.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:42.670
And that was when it occurred to me — If
we were to implement the Desire Path at home

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:48.660
soon after the wedding, we should pack off
the mother-in-law and the father-in-law, or

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.630
rather the boy’s parents on a honeymoon.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.990
Please leave the house.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:13:00.840
By the time you are back, the house would
have a Desire Path.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.740
Of this girl who had just come in.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:09.460
And that is how things should be, if you want
marital bliss.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.080
Think about it!

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:17.270
Vignesh Shankar told me — Now I get what
passion really means.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.870
You launched one video every day consistently,
now I understand.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.870
You have a commitment.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.680
You want to pass it on.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680
Yes.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.680
Yes.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.680
Yes.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680
Yes.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680
But..

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.160
There was one more revelation that I had.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.370
This thing they repeat often “Do it with
passion”, “Do it with passion”… many

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.360
people have given many definitions over the
years, to this Passion-word.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.360
I got one.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.620
One could even say I learned it the hard way.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.920
And, this is MY definition for passion.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.720
And it goes like this.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:58.010
It says, “It is the ability to be at it,
even when you are not good at it, yet!”

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:08.180
Even if you are not an expert at it, even
when you are still learning the ropes, the

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.940
feeling that you will get it some day, that
you will become an expert at it some day,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:18.950
and I have the stamina and willpower to pull
through till that day, probably that is passion!

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:24.330
Probably that is the pain, suffering, struggle,
the Jesus Christ reference that we saw earlier?

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.740
To be at it even when you are not good at
it yet!

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.730
That perhaps is passion!

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.480
One friend commented to me that this word
Mentor — I didn’t know that it was really

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.320
about a person…

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.750
Thanks a lot, that’s so useful, he said!

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.210
I am gonna burst his bubble a wee bit, I am
sorry.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:54.230
Because, the information I gave you was not
“complete”.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.740
I had told you the story of Telemachus, the
son of Ulysses, and this person called Mentor,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:05.290
this old man was assigned to take care of
the boy and the story went well, or so we

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.290
thought.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.800
Sorry, the story DIDN’T go well!

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:15.029
That old man was a drunkard, he wasted time,
slept all day, Telemachus suffered without

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:16.790
a mentor!

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:26.680
And, that’s when one of the favorite Gods
in Greek Mythology, favorite Gods of Ulysses,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:33.120
the Goddess of Learning, Literature, Arts,
Warfare, a direct daughter of Zeus himself,

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:44.110
Athena by name, she, one of the skills she
had was the ability to shape-shift.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:51.580
She became the old man, Mentor, and mentored
Telemachus!

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.870
So, all the women out there!

00:15:53.870 --> 00:16:02.250
You can be truly proud and happy that the
first ever mentor was a woman!

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:08.640
In fact, if you roll back in time, I talked
about this on International Women’s Day,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.370
Happy International Women’s Day!

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.370
Thanks then!

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.180
We are at the end of 380!

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:25.170
In the next episode, 381, we will talk about
those good qualities that a subordinate should

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.560
possess to do great things with an amazing
leader!

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.489
Thank you!
