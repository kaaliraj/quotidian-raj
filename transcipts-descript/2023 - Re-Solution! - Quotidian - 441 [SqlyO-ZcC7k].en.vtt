00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:19.770
2023 is upon us. One more year. What is this
guy doing? New Year Resolution? To Exercise??

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:29.190
To exercise his right to eat burgers any time
he wants..!! What is the problem with New

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:47.680
Year Resolutions? How can we do them differently?
That is what we are going to address today!

00:00:47.680 --> 00:01:03.329
Vanakkam! Resolution.. Re-Solution? Are we
searching for a “solution”, really? What

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.530
do we look for every time a New Year comes
around? How do we even get ourselves to think

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.760
that we can achieve something that has never
before been achieved by us?

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:24.630
It seems they did some research and tracked
the progress of about a hundred people. About

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.080
their New Year Resolutions. They start on
January One, and one week later, that new

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.189
habit of hitting the gym, getting up early
in the morning, the promise not to touch non-veg

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.180
ever again, perhaps quitting smoking finally
once and for all, whatever, one week later,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.509
are you still at it, they wanted to know!
Thousands of people were surveyed, but if

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:02.299
you were to consider a sample size of a hundred
people, seventy seven percent (ONLY) continued

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.790
past one week. Already, one fourth of them
have given up.. But, that’s good news. Seventy

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:16.239
seven percent are continuing even after a
week has gone by.

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:24.240
But, do you know the bad news? The bad news
is the same group was tracked TWO YEARS from

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:35.169
the date of that New Year Resolution. How
many of you are STILL AT IT, two years from

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:44.060
the day you started? To jog daily, for example…
Are you still at it two years later? THAT

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:54.239
is the number. Less than one-fifth of the
people who take on resolutions actually continue

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.080
seriously at it.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:05.300
And, it has become so “pandemically” bad
that they have even instituted a World Quitters

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.920
Day. The Second Friday of January. Every year,
the second Friday of the first month of the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.360
year is called the Quitters Day, for that’s
when, most of the pretenders and wannabes

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.890
throw their hands up, and tear everything
up and swing back to their old, original,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.360
dull and boring, limited self.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:42.299
A friend of mine by name Kapil actually recently
drew this beautiful cartoon. On New Year Day,

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:52.460
he wakes up at 5 am. Cycles. Runs. Does weights
in the gym. But… you know what’s going

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:00.209
to happen.. On 5th Jan, he wakes up only at
5:30 am, cycles, runs, but doesn’t turn

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:08.310
up at the gym. On 9th Jan, 6:30 am, doesn’t
run either. But, by the time it is 10th Jan,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.930
(13th Jan is World Quitters Day by the way!),
10th Jan he is still in bed and all those

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:25.790
resolutions are forgotten. Is there a scientific
reason? Can we derive a few reasons why this

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:37.250
could be happening? I see three! The first
thing is he has taken on a chain! Did he accept

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.169
one challenge? Only one? Already a late-riser,
which means he is already troubling himself

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:54.260
too much by forcing himself to get up that
early. Then cycling, then running, then weight-lifting.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.800
Chaining. Start one at a time. Also, when
you start one at a time, when you take on

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.479
that one, it should be atomic. Try lifting
just the rod alone without any additional

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:18.240
weights! Or, just go to the gym, climb the
stairs, watch, look around, come back, that’s

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.639
exercise enough for you. Start atomically.
The third mistake is, he is all by himself.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:37.100
We will come back to this later in the talk
today. Lonely. All by himself.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.390
The Atomic Habits book. We have seen this
earlier too. By James Clear. In that book,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:52.190
he talks about how to strengthen and cement
and make a habit permanent. He gives four

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:00.100
beautiful tricks. Each related to the other.
The first thing he says is, “Make it easy

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.790
for the hands”. So, for example, if your
intent is to stop junk food and start eating

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.110
fruits instead, try and choose a fruit that
doesn’t require too much preparation, cleaning,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.479
and presentation! If it requires all that
mess before you can eat it, it is not easy

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:26.840
on your hands! And probably you may not get
into the habit. The second advice, “Keep

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:36.050
it attractive to the eyes”. Do you already
like the jackfruit? (Well, it fails the first

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.770
test, sorry!) Do you already like bananas?
Use that! When setting up targets, instead

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.250
of obsessing over your fruit intake, specifically
a particular fruit intake, why not just make

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:52.460
it easier by generalising it to Fruits, and
take your favourite fruit until the habit

00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:02.289
is cemented? Keep it attractive to the eyes.
The third advice? Keep it satisfying to the

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.531
heart. You switched from junk food, didn’t
you? While coming to eat fruits instead? Have

00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:13.509
you ever felt a warm feeling in your heart
when you gave money to the shopkeeper and

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:24.270
brought home a pack of chips?! No! On the
other hand, you go to the lady at the street-corner

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:33.550
and buy some fruits, and without bargaining,
you give her a little tip, “Keep the change!”,

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.789
… you are adding an extra bonus there, you
are also warming your heart. So, keep it satisfying

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:51.349
to the heart! And finally, keep it in front
of your face! Hide the unhealthy snack. Far

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:55.630
from your reach. Locked up somewhere. If you
really need it, you can fetch a ladder, get

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:02.759
the key, and unlock the junk! But have these
fruits on the dining table, right at the third

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:12.830
level in the fridge, have stickers that remind
you that fruits are there.. In front of your

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.650
face! E. A. S. I. Easy!

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:25.970
This person is Jack Butcher. He runs a beautiful
website, has a Twitter account and an Instagram

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:35.760
account. His specialisation today (he has
been an ad man!) is he visualises concepts

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:43.320
in very simple terms and makes you really
think. Take a look at these pictures. The

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.550
three pictures that I am going to show you
are all pairs.. Of This Versus That. I thought

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:56.560
these three sets were relevant for the New
Year Resolution thing we were talking about.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:07.579
Days Versus Decades. This is how the days
are going to be. Do not expect Perfection

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:18.280
in your Quest. Have a Quest FOR Perfection.
This is Quest For Perfection. Need to keep

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.391
getting better. Must reach great heights.
Etc. But, that is not how the days are going

00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:30.810
to be. There will be Ups. There will be Downs.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:40.600
Here is another. Aiming High Versus Aiming
Low. If you aim low, even if you HIT your

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:51.660
mark, where are you?! If you aim high, even
if you miss your mark, where are you?! So,

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.000
you tell me, where are you going to aim?!

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:08.670
The third set I want to show you, from Jack
Butcher, is this one. Get Going Versus Get

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:16.490
Good. Too many among us make this mistake.
If I start it, I should do it only if I will

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.930
do a really good job. Else, not at all. If
it is not really exceptional, soon after I

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:32.860
start, I would rather stop. Instead, the author
says, focus on just getting out of your bed!

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:41.040
Just get out of your bed. The gym will wait
for you. Then, just walk to the gym. Don’t

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:48.940
even knock the door. Just walk to the gym
and come back. Then, enter the gym, walk around

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:59.889
inside the gym, then.. touch the metal, feel
it, move things around, learn how to operate

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:08.600
things, look around at the other people, say
hi!, then, .. probably set it at the lowest

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:17.410
setting and spend thirty seconds pulling the
wires. That’s how you improve. You have

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:25.210
to Get Going, and once you get going, Newton’s
First Law, once you overcome the inertia,

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:32.940
Getting Good is BOUND to happen. The problem
is when we focus on getting good before even

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.630
we really get going.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:46.589
Do you remember this story? We have talked
about this extensively. That jar. The rocks.

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:54.399
The gravel, little stones. And sand. We talked
about how prioritisation was so important.

00:11:54.399 --> 00:12:00.110
I am going to give you three twists. Think
about it.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.019
Here is Twist Number One. Whoever said that
all this has to be stuffed into this single

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:13.990
jar?? These have to be placed in a jar, is
that not it? Well, let me bring my friend’s

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:21.800
jar, let me bring my colleague’s jar, let
me bring my maanger’s jar! Who stopped you

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:30.050
from thinking like that? This is what they
call the Growth Mindset. Don’t be set into

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:35.050
a box. Nobody drew that box around you. It
was of your own making.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:42.840
Here is another Twist. Who told you that you
can’t get yourself a Bigger Jar? How did

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.930
you end up with THAT Jar? You wake up at a
particular time, you go to bed at a particular

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:57.029
time, you have a particular set way of work,
probably a suboptimal way.. Do you know how

00:12:57.029 --> 00:13:03.110
much time you waste in a day? Who is keeping
track? If we do that perhaps, we will know

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:08.940
we actually have access to a larger jar!

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:17.680
Okay, here is the third Twist. Who told you
that you need to fit in all those rocks? Rocks

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.350
aren’t a simple matter. Whether you place
them in the beginning or tag them along in

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:31.800
the end, it is a tough job. So, choose one
big thing, not multiple big things. The smaller

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:40.180
things can be a few more, you can handle them.
But, focusing on one big thing itself is hard.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:46.170
Don’t take on too many rocks. Also, have
you wondered if you could get yourself a hammer?

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:53.110
If you encounter a rock, perhaps you can pulverise
it into sand, and the whole game changes,

00:13:53.110 --> 00:14:00.480
did you notice?! That is the mindset I want
you to have, when listening to this story

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.480
again.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:09.880
Do you remember, we called that guy “Lonely”?
I did that because I felt that they failed

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:16.880
to involve the most powerful force in the
game. Which is the Power of Others. What will

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:23.320
others think if they come to know that I have
set this as my goal?? — If that is what

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.660
your fear is going to be, probably it is not
a goal worth pursuing in the first place.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:36.730
You have a goal? Others should be proud. Others
should be happy. Others should thank you for

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.029
having that as your goal!

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:44.649
There are many reasons why this really works
out, the first one being the spiritual realignment

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:50.279
of the universe, in response to your request!
If you boldly declare it to the universe,

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:56.470
it will change shape and create a path, at
least that’s what they say, and will help

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.310
you to your dream.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:05.730
But, probably that’s not a yarn for people
like you, but THIS? You will surely agree.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:13.190
If you have an accountability partner, for
example, “Hey, I will pick you up on the

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.410
way to the gym, let us do it together, you
stand at the street corner”, if you tie

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:24.029
something like that with somebody, would you
dare miss one day’s Gym? He will skin you

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:29.452
alive the next day! Why? You have made another
person wake up, and stand and wait for you

00:15:29.452 --> 00:15:36.930
in the cold in the middle of the road! So,
having an activity partner really helps!

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:47.140
There is another reason why the Power of Others
is very important. Instead of doing it just

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:52.620
for your own sake, if you start doing something
because you want somebody else to possibly

00:15:52.620 --> 00:16:02.660
benefit from your improvement, it is a greater,
loftier, better WHY. Take this example itself,

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:10.950
of the person going to the gym, cycling, running,
waking up early. Will Smith in his autobiography

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:21.050
says, his obsession with fitness, his bullying
attitude, his anger, do you know where it

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:29.320
came from? It came from watching his Dad repeatedly
physically abuse his Mom. And, when he was

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:39.279
about 13 years old, Will Smith’s Mom leaves
home never to come back. So, Will Smith decides,

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:45.790
“I am going to get strong!” — When you
have something like that, “for the women

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:56.240
in my family, for my sister, for the girl
down the road, to protect them,..” you will

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:02.000
be able to manage this much easier than “I
am doing this so that I can show my biceps

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000
on my Instagram account”..! The Power of
Others.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.730
I am going to introduce this little beautiful
website and App to you. It is called HabitShare.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:27.590
Available on iOS and Android. It is just a
beautiful social task tracker. If you have

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:35.919
set a goal, this will help you achieve it
repeatedly, and not just that, it is going

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:44.120
to let you introduce some friends into the
same game. And, they can watch your progress.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:52.110
And they can encourage you along. They can
complain, criticise, warn. The best of all?

00:17:52.110 --> 00:18:00.720
This App is completely free! I myself am a
slave to this App. I invite you to join up.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:07.340
By the way, I have to share this as a closing
thought. All this while, we have been talking

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.970
about New Year Resolutions. And, I am quite
sure a particular special friend of mine would

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:18.299
have had this thought surely! And, for that
specific reason, I am placing this Calvin

00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:28.510
and Hobbess comic strip for them! The Tiger
asks Calvin about his New Year Resolutions.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:37.441
And, this is the wisecrack response, from
the boy! “Resolutions? Me?? Just what are

00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:44.320
you implying? That I need to change?? Well,
Buddy, as far as I’m concerned, I’m perfect

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:53.039
the way I am!” So, … this is another stance
to have! You probably don’t need resolutions!

00:18:53.039 --> 00:19:04.250
You are already very good, keep it up! Enjoy
life! Jan 1 is just another day! Thank you!

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:18.510
We will meet soon! I think it is on January
3rd. Bye bye!
