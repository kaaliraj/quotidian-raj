00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.630
In Canada, there is a city called Quebec.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.260
There, there is an annual festival.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.510
Festival du Cochon.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.120
In Sainte-Perpetue..

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:22.200
In that place, it is a pig festival…

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.991
And, the specific act that you see there is
“Wrestling with a greased pig”!

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:34.820
A fully greased pig, lolling in muddy slush,
you roll around along with it, and wrestle

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.820
it!

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.750
What a tradition!

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.350
We were talking about DonkeyPits, weren’t
we?

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.600
Just in the previous episode..

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.510
As I was researching about it, this was one
important advice I came across!

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.120
“Never wrestle with a pig”.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.250
“Oh, you are in the DonkeyPit?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.580
Let me also get into DonkeyPit..!” — never
attempt this.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.580
Why?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.360
Because, the pig has experience, remember
that.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.430
And, you both get dirty, remember that!

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.200
And, the pig is going to enjoy it, remember
that!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.350
They will bring you down to their level and
beat you with their experience!

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.562
— when dealing with a DonkeyPit!

00:01:25.562 --> 00:01:28.710
That is the challenge!

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:44.360
You cannot become a DonkeyPit yourself!

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.290
Namaste!

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.140
This is the second of two parts, about DonkeyPits..!

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.140
We were talking about pig wrestling.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.070
Don’t ever wrestle with a pig, said Robert
Sutton!

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.720
What else did he say?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.550
He says, “Many people continue to stay..

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.670
You have identified that this person is a
DonkeyPit.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.330
But, why do you continue to stay?

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.330
Could be a spouse.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.510
Could be a friend.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.760
Could be a manager.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.290
Could even be the boss.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.650
Or even a cofounder.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.300
Why do they continue to stay?

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.129
In economics, there is this concept called
the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:44.010
Having done this far, having sweated it out,
having put in this much effort and time, I

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.390
don’t think it makes any sense coming out
of this relationship..”

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.420
Sunk Cost Fallacy.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.600
You must surely remember the recent movie
called “Love Today”.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.440
In that movie, towards the end, the last few
minutes, there is this scene at the beach.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.890
I am sure you remember.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.069
They both talk about it.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:21.360
That guy says, “I had a perception about
the girl I’d fall in love with…”

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.220
But he finishes off with, “Well, the perception
is true, but I want it to be you”.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.700
A very beautiful ending.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.270
In this context, such an ending is amazing.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.470
But, this is the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.590
All of us start with expectations, and then
reality hits us, and that’s when we say,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.030
“Enough is enough!”

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:53.829
Good, most of the time, Great in this case,
but, also, Sutton says, Sunk Cost Fallacy,

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.970
it is a fallacy, remember, it prevents you
from realising, “Hey, why am I stuck in

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.939
this DonkeyPit, with this DonkeyPit..?!”

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.780
Get out of it!

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.450
Snap out of it!

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.750
There is a plate.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.200
There are many cookies in that plate.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.419
Each one takes one.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.150
There is a group of people, a party, a team
meeting, whatever..

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.820
Or.. it need not even be a plate.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.290
It need not even be a cookie.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.430
It could be the Winnings.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.430
The Profit.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.580
It could be the Awards that we have won.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.830
What is the right behaviour for a leader?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.580
Forget the leader.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.860
Look at ANYBODY for that matter.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.310
What’s the right etiquette?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:47.571
If there is only one biscuit left on the plate,
you shouldn’t be the person to pick that

00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:48.571
last one!

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:49.571
Won’t they say this?

00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:50.571
Didn’t our mom and dad train us with this
advice?

00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:52.009
Don’t eat that last biscuit.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.620
Some of us do that trick… break into two
halves and take one..

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.970
Our Simon Sinek, we have met him earlier,
he has written a BOOK on the subject — he

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.540
says, “Leaders Eat Last!”

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:14.580
We hear a lion roaring and all the way from
Africa comes a lion to ask us this question,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.889
“Hey, you know what the Lion’s share is?

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.960
All my wives and children (I have more than
one wife, mind you!) all my wives and children,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.290
they hunt and then they call me, they don’t
dare touch it!

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:38.610
I will take the lion’s share.. that still-beating
heart, still-warm bloody muscles, I feast

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.240
on it sumptuously, and the rest of the bit
morsels, I give it to the others.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.620
I am the leader!

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.220
Want to ask me something?” asks the lion.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.310
How do you reconcile these two?

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.330
Well, we are not in the jungle, and we are
not just a mammal.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.520
We are a primate!

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.840
We evolved from HERE!

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.850
And, what do these people do?

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.229
These monkey people!?

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.690
They do… monkey business!

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.210
They have a book on that subject!

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.210
Exclusively!

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:20.020
What can we learn just observing the social
lives of these chimpanzees and gorillas!?

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.220
Three important lessons.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:33.080
Lesson Number One is, “Keep your friends
close, but those enemies, somehow form a relationship

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.090
with them, keep them closer!”

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.660
Tip for you, in case you are stuck with DonkeyPits!

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:48.180
Yes, friends are important, but you need to
know what your enemies are doing.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.510
What those jerks are up to.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.780
So, bond with them.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.890
Learn from the chimps.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.210
Here is one more.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.330
The Second Lesson is, “It is good to be
feared.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.180
The spine-chilling effect your presence can
have.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.180
Yes.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.759
But, even better than that is, .. it is GREAT
to be liked!”

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:17.720
That love far surpasses the fear or the respect
factor.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.060
How do you get that love?

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.310
You get by eating last.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.270
You get, by sacrificing your meal.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:33.669
Seeming to give away the best that you have
earned so that the others who can’t win

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:39.379
it by themselves, benefit because of your
relationship with them.

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:41.169
I can pluck one more.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.650
I can hunt one more.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.650
You can’t.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.419
So, I am giving my best to you.

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:52.009
What a lesson if you are going to work with
DonkeyPits!

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:59.840
And, finally, it is also about having some
kind of common enemy…

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.199
Remember covid?

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:05.990
All countries, including warring ones, declared
truce!

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.039
They got together.

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:14.259
When there is a common enemy, internal skirmishes
are forgotten.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:25.700
In the same way, identify a much larger, a
real problem out there, that person AND you,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:34.660
the DonkeyPit AND you, you will see a greater
purpose, a common cause, to band together

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.660
for!

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:44.070
If a lion approaches, the chimps, even ones
that were fighting just moments ago, will

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.290
band together, one will hand fruits to the
other, the other will aim it at the lion.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.950
That is how they survive in the plains of
Africa.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.330
What beautiful lessons!

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.930
He goes on to give two more lessons.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.700
I find it hard to believe..

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.470
can anybody even try such approaches..!

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.471
But the guy is famous.

00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:07.471
Dr. Sutton.

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.540
Is a professor at Harvard.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.170
He says, “Reduce Social Distancing!”

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:17.740
No no, not the covid mask kinda distancing!

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.660
He says, “Distancing comes when you have
disparity in pay.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:31.470
If you have too much of a skew there, … just
like we saw in the birds on a tree cartoon,

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:39.240
similarly, when the disparity grows larger,
the fight, the tendency to act like a jerk,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.730
the problems, start surfacing!

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:47.690
In the Society, the Social Distancing must
be reduced!

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:55.630
The way he recommends it, he seems to question
even the difference in salary, person to person!

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.890
Why should they even be different?!

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.519
Sounds almost communist!

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:01.600
But.. interesting!

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.600
He also underlines one more beautiful recommendation.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600
I really loved it.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.640
We have seen it earlier in the Adam Grant
book “Give and Take”.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.580
He says, “Yes, you are rewarding..

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:23.510
When somebody receives and somebody else gives,
yes, you reward the person who gave a lot.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.170
As the Great Giver.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:32.160
But, you should also reward the person who
gets!

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.579
Because, that person has had the courage to
ask for it!

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:42.589
Asking for help is SO important.

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:48.100
In a team, if there is to be a lubrication,
a smoothness, a friction-free interaction,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.070
it is not enough if there is a Giver..

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.040
There has to be a person who knows how to
ASK too!

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:01.990
When you have both kinds of people, those
sitting inside DonkeyPits, will find it very

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.380
hard continuing in that DonkeyPit.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:09.130
Water Isaacson wrote the biography of the
great Steve Jobs.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:15.200
In that biography, there are multiple times
where one wonders if the author is alluding

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:25.270
to the fact that Steve Jobs has been the greatest
DonkeyPit of them all, without being explicit

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.589
about it..

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:35.399
He is an amazing visionary, no questions about
it, he changed the world of technology and

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:41.620
business and entertainment, not just once,
but multiple times, I love him, but beyond

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.399
all that, what a DonkeyPit he has been!!

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:51.480
But, wait, there is a redeeming factor in
that book.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.380
Towards the end, in the Afterword.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.779
The author writes, “I asked Steve.

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:04.920
My manuscript is ready, do you want to give
it a quick glance…?

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.100
He was still in the hospital.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.190
Not too bedridden and sick.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.279
I asked if he would like to see it, because,
that’s what I do.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:17.139
When I write a biography, I respect the person.

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:23.600
For which, Steve responded with, Don’t show
it to me..!

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.390
The only reason I wanted you to write it?

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.839
Something had to be there that my children
can relate to..

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:33.209
What kind of person was the?

00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:35.639
Why was he such a person?

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:38.010
DonkeyPit or not..!

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.139
That explanation has to be given by somebody..

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:43.820
For when I am done, when I die, people won’t
be silent.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.329
They ARE going to write their versions.

00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:51.050
Here is somebody who has worked with me, lived
my life along with me, to whom I have shared

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.110
my most private secrets, … Somebody who
has understood that and penned this, will

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.900
probably say something closer to the truth..

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.220
So I asked you to write this!

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.600
Don’t show it to me!

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.750
I know there will be parts in that book that
I won’t like!”

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.339
Isn’t that amazing?

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:16.080
I think he has redeemed himself, in that one
line.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.190
Recently, Hervé Renard, Saudi Arabia’s
coach.. for the Football World Cup team.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.190
Before the halftime whistle, they had been
thrashed soundly by Argentina.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.399
During the half-time break, this is what happened
in the room.

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.220
And then, history.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.290
Argentina LOST to Saudi Arabia.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.920
What happened?

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.190
In that dressing room?

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.899
They even had a translator!

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:35.400
“Take your phone, you can make a picture
with him if you want!

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.449
You are in front of the defence!

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:38.550
You have nobody?

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.389
You have to follow him!

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:42.220
With ball, you were good!

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.380
Did you see what you did?

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.010
Don’t you feel something?

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.550
Don’t you feel we are able to come back?

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.310
Don’t you feel it?

00:13:51.310 --> 00:14:09.710
Come on guys, come on, this is a World Cup!

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:18.240
Give EVERYTHING!”

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:36.660
He gave an excoriating motivational speech..

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.660
If Messi comes, you want to have selfie with
him, or do you want to defend against him?!

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.509
This galvanised the team, these people performed,
and defeated Argentina!

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:50.550
This is scientifically proven!

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:59.170
Usually mild-mannered people, coaches for
example, when they momentarily, occasionally,

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:06.670
once in a while, temporarily, blow their top,
people watch, people listen, and they follow!

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:13.139
If THIS (soft-spoken) person, if he himself
is reacting like this, there has to be something

00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:15.420
that has really gone wrong.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.130
Let us go back to the basics, let us fix it,
let us do it for our man.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.930
For him!

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:24.930
Scientifically proven!

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:33.050
So, I am not saying, “Don’t be in the
DonkeyPit at all”, that is the Closing Thought

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.050
too.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:40.300
Aristotle is supposed to have said, “Anger
is an easy emotion.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.529
Anybody, anywhere, can get angry about anything!

00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:53.699
But…, to be angry with the right person,
and to the right degree, and at the right

00:15:53.699 --> 00:16:03.029
time, and for the right purpose, and in the
right way..!

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:16.769
That is not at all easy, doesn’t come naturally
to all…

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:18.269
So, yes, practice measured anger.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:19.779
Not from inside a DonkeyPit!

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:20.779
That’s all!

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:20.980
Thank you!
