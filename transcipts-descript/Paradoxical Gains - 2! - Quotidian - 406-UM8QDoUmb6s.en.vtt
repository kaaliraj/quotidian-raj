00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.160
This thing called Zen Buddhism… followers
of it simply LOVE paradoxes.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.990
Take this, for example.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.910
There were these four or five monks who were
passing by a temple and they saw a flag.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.630
It was moving in the wind.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.180
One guy commented: “The flag is moving!”

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.430
The other guy, wanting to show that he is
probably superior and more enlightened, said,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.190
“The WIND is moving!”…

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.210
The third guy came along.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:52.899
“Not the flag, Not the wind, your MIND is
moving”, he said.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.190
The guru, the wise teacher of these all, he
came along finally.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.120
He said, “Wind, flag, mind moves.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.620
The same understanding.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.240
But, when the mouth opens, all are wrong!”

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:19.940
Do you understand the paradox there?

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.570
Namaste!

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:37.170
Paradoxes, and gains from paradoxes!

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.400
If you are trying to be a leader, if you want
to be a leader, if you ARE a leader, Part

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.400
Two!

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.690
Where did we close out yesterday?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.570
We have seen two!

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.610
There are six more to go!

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.900
What are they?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:00.939
Paradox Number Three:- It is that beautiful,
delicate balance between visibility and of

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:01.990
course, invisibility.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.700
It should seem like it is there..

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.819
It should also seem like it is not there!

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.959
I don’t know what YOU think!

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.239
But, this guy bears an uncanny resemblance
to Rahul Gandhi!

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.330
I am using this picture here because I was
looking for a waiter…

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.060
at a star hotel.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060
He is special, for a reason.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.030
One of the most important trainings that are
given to this person is… how to be available

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.500
the moment you are needed, AND, how to just
vanish into the wallpaper, when you are not

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500
needed.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.310
You SHOULD NOT poke your nose into an intimate
conversation between two people, asking them

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.730
if it would be mineral water or normal water.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.890
But, at the same time, when somebody is trying
to refill his glass from a bottle, and the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.459
bottle is empty…, and even before he looks
up and asks for a refill, “I knew you would

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.530
want this.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.709
Here is some water.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.380
Here is something else you might like” — That
is a great quality.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.380
Visible.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.830
As well as Invisible.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.160
Also, Visibility is about showing the path…

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:27.180
Invisibility is about having shown the path,
step off it, and watch and help the others

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.761
pay attention to the path, not you!

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:36.280
If you observe a swimming coach in action,
you would learn perhaps the very same lesson!

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.390
“Come on over!

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.440
I am there to help” — She would call out
loudly to the fearful child!

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.370
She will seem to be angelic, the most helpful!

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.480
But, at the crucial moment, it would seem
as if she has deserted you!

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.910
“Oh my god, she has left me to die!

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.910
I am drowning!”

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.510
That is the feeling you would get.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.910
But, we know.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.310
We always know.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.310
Before the child, before the learner, really
drowns, really gets into some serious trouble,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.909
the coach will be there, Invisibility would
have turned to Visibility.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:27.860
Being there when needed, giving way, and becoming
invisible so that you can empower the rest.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:37.639
The Fourth Paradox that the book talks about
is the balance between Stubbornness and Open-mindedness.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.339
You need to have an open mind, but you also
need to be steadfast and bullheaded with your

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.339
grip.

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:46.559
How on earth is that going to be possible??

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:47.559
Yes!

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:52.259
We have actually talked about it in some earlier
Quotidians.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.749
In fact in 352, we specifically talked about
Light but Heavy.

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.969
I am sure you will remember.

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.919
We had broken it down into four quadrants.

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.180
Strong opinions, Weak opinions, Strongly held,
Weakly held…

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.749
And, which is the winner among these?

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:19.399
Strong convictions, strong opinions, but held
lightly!

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:23.479
Why is it so special though?

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:30.189
It is that metal hand, that robotic, all-powerful
metal hand holding an egg.

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.229
It can of course grip even harder.

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.169
But, if it does, it knows the shell will break!

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.639
That knowledge is key!

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.580
This person’s name is Paul Saffo.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.259
The original futurist, you could call him.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.960
He created The Institute for the Future.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.449
He was the person who made this phrase super-popular.

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.120
Strong opinions, weakly held.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120
Why?!

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.960
Why is it so important?

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.520
Well, it is important to have a strong opinion.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.520
Because?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.469
For a weak opinion, you don’t need to do
much research.

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.089
Only if you research hard and deep, your opinion
will strengthen.

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.830
You must have spent a lot of time obsessing
about it.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.119
And, so, that is why you are stubborn.

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:17.569
It is a very strong opinion you are holding
on to.

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.610
At the same time, you have to encourage conflict.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.629
You have to find out what other people think.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:29.289
“You tell me”, “You go ahead, share”,
“What do YOU think”, you should go around

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:30.289
asking for opinions.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.289
Invite conflict.

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.289
Ask them.

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:33.289
Challenge them.

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.580
“Can you break my fortress down?”

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.819
Why?

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.210
I will become a member of your fortress!

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.210
Open-mindedness!

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.849
I am going to jump right over!

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.499
It is almost like climbing up a ladder!

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:50.839
The rungs of a ladder are not made to hold
on to your weight for ever!

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:58.979
They are made only to hold on to your weight
for that little time, before which you will

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.319
climb to the next rung!

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.319
Stubborn!

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:07.659
As well as Open-Minded!

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:15.940
The fifth, conflicting, paradoxical balance
— That’s about Personal and Collective

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.940
approaches.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.649
Treat everybody the same, hollers one philosophy.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:24.189
Treat each person uniquely, claims another.

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:25.969
Both are needed!

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.909
Treat everybody equally…

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:35.889
Treat everybody individually too!

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.080
Classic case from cricket.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.589
These two, they used to play for the same
IPL team.

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:44.459
Dinesh Karthik and Gautham Gambhir.

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:50.619
And, as captain for both these players, was
our Virender Sehwag.

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:55.219
And, both of these were going through a dull
patch in cricket.

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:58.810
How did Sehwag address their problems?

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.679
Sehwag had a private meeting with Gautam Gambhir.

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:04.800
And challenged him.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
Taunted him.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800
Mocked him.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.969
“What nonsense are you doing?

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:11.699
My grandma can play better cricket than you!”

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:17.429
Next match, … feeling righteously hurt,
deciding to “show Sehwag what he is made

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:25.679
of”, Gautam Gambhir, like a tiger, like
a wounded tiger, fought back, came, hit a

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:26.679
75!

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:32.570
On the other hand, knowing that the same approach
wouldn’t work out well with Dinesh Karthik,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.570
what did Sehwag do?

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.419
He took Dinesh Karthik aside, “Hey, what
are your strengths, what are your weaknesses?

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:45.130
Let’s try to leave those balls that kinda
tempt you in your weaker side.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.630
Let us focus on your strengths”.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:55.251
That was the “deal” that Sehwag struck
with Dinesh Karthik, and once again, that

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:58.199
approach worked with Dinesh Karthik.

00:08:58.199 --> 00:09:02.540
This wouldn’t have worked for him, that
wouldn’t have worked for this guy!

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.560
This is the famous “Shoes for people”
conundrum.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.670
Such a large shoe for one person, such a petty
shoe for the other??

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.569
How is it fair, you may wonder.

00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:19.279
But, that is only until you realise, one of
them is probably Lebron James, and the other

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:24.139
is that little kid born just a year ago!

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:27.090
You will have all KINDS of people.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:34.470
“To treat everybody fairly” DOES NOT mean
“To treat everybody equally”!

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:40.930
So, you need to have that Personal approach,
while having that global Collective.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.050
They even call it the Big Picture.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.139
In your mind.

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:46.139
Paradox.

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:47.139
Hard.

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:50.000
But, that’s the challenge.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.290
The Sixth Paradox is that classic, world-famous
balance between being a Teacher while also

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.389
being a Learner.

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:06.350
Some people would actually quip — “You
can Teach only if you are a good Learner”.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.589
And, they have also said — “I am able
to Learn a lot, only because I Teach regularly”!

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:16.089
That’s a paradox, right there!

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:23.079
One example, for this Teaching / Learning
dichotomy, would be this concept called The

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:24.389
Skinny Chef.

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:30.649
Would you want a chef looking like this to
come around and hand you a menu?

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:33.100
Wouldn’t you look at him quite doubtfully?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:40.639
For, you don’t seem to be a person who has
cooked well, and eaten heartily, …

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.620
… like this guy!

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:48.589
Only if you are looking like THIS, I would
be comforted by the thought that I would be

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:50.950
happy and hearty like you, if I eat the food
you cook!

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.959
Are you eating your own dog food?

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:56.430
You are going around, teaching everybody what
to do…

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.740
Are you following that yourself first?!

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.129
Are you walking the talk?!

00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:02.730
You want us all to learn.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.240
Are YOU learning?

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.449
That is the question.

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:16.439
And hence, the Teacher ALSO has to demonstrate
that they are a Learner.

00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:18.050
Same stands for a leader.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:26.339
A leader has to demonstrate, when he is Preaching,
that he is also Walking the Talk.

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:30.569
So, the Teaching / Learning dichotomy.

00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:32.379
The Seventh Paradox.

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:34.190
What is that one going to be about?

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.370
It is about setting very High Standards.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.370
Okay.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.920
You have set very high standards.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.790
What if we can’t match up to those standards?

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.740
Be Gracious in your Forgiveness!

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.300
Learn to Blissfully Forgive!

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.769
Expectations should be SKY HIGH!

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:03.050
Take the case of these incidents.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:14.370
In 1979, Three Mile Island was a human-error-triggered
nuclear disaster in America.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.730
A peace-time nuclear accident.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.240
Human error.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.139
1986 — Not more than seven/eight years later.

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:27.499
In Chernobyl.

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:30.339
A worse accident occurred.

00:12:30.339 --> 00:12:31.339
Again?

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:32.399
Human error.

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:36.439
So, my contention here?

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:40.589
Okay, you haven’t set High Standards.

00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:42.850
Human errors have crept in.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.100
But, what repair did you do?

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.040
How did you ensure it won’t happen again?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.379
You jailed that guy perhaps.

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:54.189
Fired him from his sorry job.

00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:55.269
But, what happened?

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:59.050
When somebody else replaced them?

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:04.089
Did you ensure nobody can make that human
error once again?

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:05.540
That is the always-rising standards.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.110
That has to be set up.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:15.180
If, even inspite of all that, if somebody
screws up, it is a slap on YOUR face.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.480
You haven’t put a great enough process in
place.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.110
Remember that!

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:27.980
So, always keep raising your standards, while
being Gracious in your Forgiveness, because,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:34.560
you see that as an opportunity to learn, you
see that as an opportunity to raise your standard

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.490
EVEN HIGHER.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:43.309
The Last Paradox — is the difference between
these two similar sounding words.

00:13:43.309 --> 00:13:45.559
Timely… and Timeless.

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:47.809
What is timely?

00:13:47.809 --> 00:13:49.309
Perfectly timed.

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:53.750
The right thing happening at the right time.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.540
Giving the right advice at the right time.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.029
What about timeless?

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:00.029
Eternal!

00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:03.009
You can look it up any day!

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:07.629
“Thou shalt not lie” — is eternal advice.

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:13.660
Those ten commandments — each of them — you
don’t need to ask Moses what the expiry

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.000
date on each of them is..!

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.170
Beautiful advice.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.519
Take these two examples!

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:24.809
You know what happened with Steve Jobs.

00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:28.589
Steve Jobs had very few maxims.

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:33.740
One of them, the love for minimalism.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.680
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.910
Even today, more than ten years after his
passing, what does Apple still strive to do?

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.220
How do we make things simpler, and more elegant?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.709
He has captured that for eternity!

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:55.170
Can anybody from Apple ever say, “The soul
of Apple has changed, we don’t believe in

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.970
that ‘simple maxim’ anymore!”?

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.720
It is a timeless advice.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.339
A thousand no’s, for a single yes!

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:13.019
If we say a single Yes, please remember, we
have rejected a thousand other, less amazing

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:14.019
alternatives!

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:16.899
Timeless advice!

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:20.860
On the other hand, look at the case of this
person!

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.260
He is Winston Churchill.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.170
They even called him the “Winningest Premier”.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.180
Such a powerful, charismatic leader.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.930
The person who led Britain during its “Finest
Hour”..

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:39.779
Such a person, who played such an important
role during the World War, the person who

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:48.860
was among the very few who actually thumbed
their nose at Hitler, and actually, eventually,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.420
won over him!

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.509
The war is over.

00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:53.509
Victory has been had!

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:55.889
A good name in hand.

00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:57.690
Elections come along.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.949
He is standing for re-election.

00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:02.220
What would one expect?!

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.129
He has past achievements.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.040
He has personal glory.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.949
He has celebrity status.

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:10.329
What more would one need?!

00:16:10.329 --> 00:16:13.769
He must have had a landslide victory!

00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:14.769
No!

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:19.579
“What plans do you have for the next four
years, they wanted to know.

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:22.569
Are you going to buy a thousand airplanes?

00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:24.069
A hundred army tanks?

00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:28.240
Or, … are you going to lay new roads, rebuild
the damaged school buildings and uplift the

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.559
education status, .. You are not a peacetime
thinker.

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:32.320
You are of a different ilk.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.389
We don’t want such a person.”

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:35.389
they wondered.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:38.070
He lost, he lost miserably.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.350
So, one also has to be timely.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.160
Changing with the times.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:51.220
Timeless, as well as timely.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.670
That brings us to the Closing Thought.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.670
Paradoxes.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.670
Paradoxes.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:56.670
Paradoxes everywhere.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.519
Here is one that is a personal favourite.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:05.060
There is a beautiful scene like this in “Alice
in Wonderland”.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.380
The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party is in progress.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.880
The Hatter would be asking Alice: “Do you
think I’ve gone round the bend?”

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:22.010
And, Alice would promptly respond: “Yes,
I’m afraid so.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.010
You’re mad.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.010
Bonkers.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.829
Completely off your head.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:32.390
But, I’ll tell you a secret.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:44.590
All 
the best people are!”

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.280
What a paradox…!

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:55.940
So, you may be seen as cranky, crazy, but,
you are well on your way to being a great

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:05.260
leader!

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.580
All the best!
