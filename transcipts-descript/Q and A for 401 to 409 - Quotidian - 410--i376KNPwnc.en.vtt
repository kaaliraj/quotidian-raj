00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:23.900
Raj:- Namaste! 410! Like last time, we have
a colleague this time from Zoho, she’s actually

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.920
an ex-student of the Zoho Schools of Learning.
From the School of Technology. Shruthika is

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.190
her name! She volunteered to do the host role
this time. She will take us through comments

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.290
and opinions that we have received till now.
We will share our responses, if any, about

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.290
them now!

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.340
Shruthika:- Hello everyone, a good day to
you all! Thank you, Raj, for the introduction.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.810
I am really honored to do this. It is going
to be a great journey. I hope you guys have

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.550
fun watching this too! Thank you!

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.489
This is from Q 401, Some Signals. Arunkumar
Jothilal says “I like this in 37, from their

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.680
website. Hours aren’t equal. An hour isn’t
an hour. It’s a collection of minutes that

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.110
add up to an hour. And 60 uninterrupted minutes
is a higher-quality hour than an hour chopped

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.680
into four 15-minute sessions. Uninterrupted
hours lead to quality time, quality work.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.150
Days chunked into tiny blocks of time are
a terrible way to work”.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.860
Raj:- I read a blog post by Seth Godin, recently.
Inspirational blog post about how, many of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.700
us make the classic mistake of looking at
the future as some undefinable gooey mass..

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.610
The past, the Now, and the Future. But, we
forget to realise that the future is actually

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.900
made up of days which is made of hours which
is made up of minutes.. And, if you waste

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.229
the minutes, you have lost the day, you have
lost the future! Many of us don’t realise

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.401
that! So, like Arun Kumar points out, it is
the tiny chunks that matter after all! Thank

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.659
you, Arun!

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.770
Shruthika:- This is from Davos. The same Quotidian
401. “Jeff Bezos mainly talks about how

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.530
sleep plays a major role in your life”.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.420
Raj:- And, I would like to actually thank
Davos for this… Recently, I found out that

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.670
Davos has joined the Zoho Schools of Learning!
One can’t really say which was the cause

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.830
and which was the effect. But, if, in a small
way, I have influenced somebody out there,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.260
he is from Agra… he came to know about this,
and he dug a little further, and eventually

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.511
he ended up joining Zoho Schools, well, it
is really fulfilling and comforting. Thank

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.099
you!

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.069
Shruthika:- This one is from Q 402. Victory’s
Defeat. This is from Sumithra Palanisamy.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.250
“Awesome how players do post mortem how
we won, the people who watch that should look

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.250
for how they won instead of celebrating…
if a person win, we generally have higher

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.250
expectations on them to have more wins from
there on, … that makes them more stressed

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.640
and they lose and sometimes they feel the
winning is a problem… What abhinav Bindra

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.601
said was true. I think it suits for you, sir,
“You don’t need to do Quotidians, but

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:10.010
you just WANT it”.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.670
Raj:- Right… So… I agree.. But, there’s
been this other situation too.. If we stop

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.900
with a Want alone, “Let me not do it today”
is something that can creep in. So, only if

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.410
you bake it into your routine, something like
brushing your teeth or having your bath, only

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:42.120
when you make it a “I need to do it”,
that is when some good habits probably stick..

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.599
The WANT should slowly make way to make it
a NEED. It HAS to be done. There is this beautiful

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.510
book, someday we will get to it in Quotidians,
called “The Difference Between Should and

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.710
Must”. Should is something you want to do.
Must is something the world expects you to

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.180
do. So, have the Should in place, firmly.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.430
Shruthika:- So, this one is from Q 402 as
well. “The Burden of Winning — so much

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.150
behind the scenes! Winning is not a destination
— well explained! That scene was amazing

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.220
sir, what can you give for the next generation?
Nailing! Why did we win? If we remember this,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.900
we can keep our life light and happy. Thanks
for sharing!”

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.810
Raj:- Thank you! Isn’t that Shine and Glow?
Yes, thank you! Recently, in Netflix, I was

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.550
watching a program detailing Michael Jordan’s
great wins, and then his retirement… In

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.189
one episode, his coach and his manager tell
him, “You did the right thing. You followed

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:48.380
your heart..” All that is fine. But, after
all that, what does winning give you? Winning

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.809
gives you the opportunity to wow the society
around you. The neighbourhood that you are

00:04:54.809 --> 00:05:02.729
a part of… Those fans of the world. Pushing
their excitement and joy to the next level.

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:10.539
Winning, is an opportunity you get to win
again! Performance is an opportunity you get

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.430
to go back on that stage again. If you look
at it like that, that is when it becomes a

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.309
process. It is not some destination. “I
thank the world for giving me an opportunity

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:26.499
to do this again!” And, that is the definition
of winning, according to something interesting

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.020
I read recently!

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:38.499
Shruthika:- Thank you, Raj san. So, this is
from 403. Defeat’s Victory. This is from

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.770
Shashank Krishnanand. “Great video on this
topic, Raj! Thank you for sharing. Dropping

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.129
another quote relating to this that I think
of often: The longer you live, the more you

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.300
fail. Failure is the mark of a life well lived.
In turn, the only way to live without failure

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.639
is to be of no use to anyone. — Brandon
Sanderson in The Stormlight Archive series”.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.669
Raj:- The Stormlight Archives. I came to know
about this series very recently. Shashank

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:07.860
is another colleague. So, the longer you live,
the more you fail. Wear your defeats as badges

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.560
of honour. If a person comes, saying “Do
you know where all I have lost? Do you know

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.270
how all I have been battered?”, with battle
wounds all over his body, people would see

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.089
him, dread the sight of him, and run away
from the battlefield! In those olden days,

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:32.960
in armies, they used to have this guy who
will not fix his wounds, it seems. Why? Well,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.550
if somebody has withstood so much, and has
still made his way back to the battlefield,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.460
he must be a really accomplished fighter..
And, if they have such a person in their army,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.061
oh my, how powerful this army should be, … let
us not meddle with these people! So, they

00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:54.409
used to have badges of honour, it seems..
And they are living scars.. The wounds that

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:59.869
you have suffered while fighting with your
enemies. So, beautiful!

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:03.921
Shruthika:- Okay! That was something really
interesting to hear. Something that I have

00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:08.389
not heard before. It kinda wowed me to be
honest…

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:14.259
This is from Quotidian 403 as well. Arunkumar
Jothilal says, … Defeat’s Victory is greater

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:15.699
than Victory’s Defeat…

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:23.150
Raj:- Well, I am not sure… Like anything
related to life, there’s this cyclical thing

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:30.521
that’s involved. Is it happiness? Is it
sorrow? Only in the depths of sorrow, can

00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:37.050
you really feel happiness, they say. If somebody
is all the time happy and smiling, like you,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.710
right…, we really don’t know whether we
are enjoying it to the fullest, only when

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.919
you suffer.. you appreciate the shade only
when you walk in the hot sun… So, I don’t

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.830
really know what the right formula is, but
one thing I know, defeat and victory, both

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:59.779
are to be experienced, probably in equal measure,
for a Life to be lived fully. All the best!

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:04.999
Shruthika:- I definitely agree with you Raj.
Even though I am just nineteen, I used to

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:11.649
go to dance competitions in school, and, I
think both played a big role in it, many times

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:17.180
we did lose, and that motivated us to go far,
and every time we won, we had this fear of

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.490
people having expectations on us, and we pushed
ourselves even more.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:26.180
Raj:- Correct! Do you remember, I often used
to say, “Sometimes you win. Other times,

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:34.340
you learn!” So, it is there! There is something
for you in both victory and defeat.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:43.320
Shruthika:- This is from 404, Not Found. This
is from Viswanath Subramani. He praises your

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.730
videos, and he says…

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:52.000
Raj:- I haven’t encountered this person
till now. I had made a comment about the 18

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.350
steps at Sabari Mala. Probably he is religious,
and he has done this Yatra many times. He

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.829
had given a lot of interesting tidbits about
how the Yatra happened in olden days, how

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:10.990
it has changed these days, what the mandala
actually was about, and how fastidious they

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.980
were in following those guidelines. I don’t
know if there is a similar concept, a religious

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.329
pilgrimage so elaborate in its protocol and
principles, anywhere else in the world.

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:27.990
Shruthika:- This is from 404 too. From Ramkumar
Ramaswamy. “Trivia. Amid the serious laundry

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.459
list of HTTP error codes sits an inconsequential
but rather amusing code, 418, which stands

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:38.149
for ‘I am a teapot. Therefore, I cannot
brew coffee’, created as an April Fool’s

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:43.660
prank in 1998. And, status code 451 stands
for “unavailable for legal reasons’, a

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:50.779
grim nod to Ray Bradbury’s science fiction
novel, Fahrenheit 451, which focuses on censorship”.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:53.810
Raj:- This 451 is really interesting. This
author, science fiction author, Ray Bradbury,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.069
has written a book called Fahrenheit 451.
And, 451 is supposed to be the temperature

00:09:57.069 --> 00:10:09.240
at which paper burns. So, in that science
fiction world, a dystopian society, people

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.860
are revolting, people are getting ideas, people
fight against the dictators only because they

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:21.420
read. Only because they develop their knowledge.
And, so, ‘let us burn them all’, decide

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.650
the management, and start the inferno! 451!
That is the name! Fahrenheit 451, paper burns!

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:39.089
So, look at that code number. 451! Unavailable
for legal reasons! These scientists, who put

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:46.720
the web together for us, 404, we saw that
room number, they have had a ball, they have

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:54.150
truly enjoyed! Which is why, we saw in another
Quotidian too, unless you are enjoying your

00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:01.459
work, unless every day at work is like you
are in a playground, like you are in a pit

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:10.699
filled with coloured balls, like you are in
a shower, enjoying, exhilarated, thrilled,

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:15.480
… the best work will not come out of you.
And, that’s true! These scientists, after

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.370
all, created the internet for us, didn’t
they!

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:28.220
Shruthika:- Right… So, this is from 405.
From G K Balaguru. He gives you a heart, Raj

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.220
san!

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:35.290
Raj:- Oh! G K Balaguru. The reason I dropped
his post into today’s video is, … well,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:42.000
just two months ago, he made a post, a comment,
saying, “I am going to watch every video

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.639
of yours from now on”. Many have said that,
… some don’t do it though… (You belong

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:55.089
to the latter category, I guess!), so, this
guy went a step further, and from then on,

00:11:55.089 --> 00:12:01.300
from that day on, almost like marking attendance,
every time he finishes watching a video, he

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:07.439
would leave a black heart! I came to know,
later, that this Balaguru is actually a student

00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:12.860
at Zoho Schools of Learning. So, the flock
is really growing and I am really happy to

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:20.829
see some of my students get into this game,
and some of the players become students! So,

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:22.470
it is really heartening!

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.339
Shruthika:- Hats off to your consistency,
Balaguru!…

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:26.569
Raj:- Mine..? Also??

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:31.490
Shruthika:- Definitely, definitely, Raj san.
So, we’ve been with him since Quotidian

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.499
started, and we’ve spoken about this in
class, and he has said, “And from now on,

00:12:35.499 --> 00:12:39.980
every day, I am going to post a video, and
now, I follow the Pi pattern”. It is amazing

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.600
how consistent he is and …

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.560
Raj:- Thank you thank you thank you!

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.339
Shruthika:- This is from 405. Simple is better
than complex, complex is better than complicated.

00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:53.920
Just thought it is right for life too, not
just for the programming environment.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.990
Raj:- And, this comes from a non-programmer.
And, again and again, I have noticed this,

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:06.769
you could say, this philosophy, again and
again. So many things that are given as advice

00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:13.970
to developers, are actually great pieces of
advice even to non-developers living a life.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.970
Would you agree?

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.009
Shruthika:- I definitely agree! Yeah!

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:24.410
Raj:- Keep it simple. Don’t repeat yourself.
… You start wondering, hey, is this something

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:32.610
coming from Gauthama Buddha, or is this coming
from Linus Torvalds..? Because, they say,

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:39.120
the world of programming is a microcosm. It
is actually a reflection of the big bad world

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.300
around you itself. I see that a lot. Thank
you!

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.180
Shruthika:- This is from 406. Paradoxical
Gains. Neil Neero says, “With Gambhir, it

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.990
is K L Rahul and not Dinesh Karthik”…

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:56.910
Raj:- Yeah, yeah, so, I apologised, it looked
like Karthik to me but it was actually K L

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:05.170
Rahul. But…, you know what happened…?
I had written my apology, but Neil comes,

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.959
follows up with, “Yes, at a glance K L Rahul,
DK, Ajinkya, Vikranth, Dhawal, Jayadev, Varun,

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:15.999
Shreyas, .. all look similar!” I am not
sure if he was mocking, or if he was trying

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:21.730
to help me with information… Apology given,
please take it boss!

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:28.839
Shruthika:- This is from 407. Living Forever.
From Logesh. “Dissatisfied little needle

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:35.230
swinging like a mad pendulum between the three
Times… I don’t know why I like this line

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.230
so much!”

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:44.149
Raj:- Actually, you know what, my friend,
usually, when you like something soooo much,

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:50.879
sooooooo much, bordering on love, and you
are asked “WHY”, you won’t be able to

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:56.480
say it. In fact, you can even call it the
Grammar of Love. If, faced with the question,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.839
“How much do you like something”, you
are able to give explanations, scientific

00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:06.010
derivations etc, you are actually not liking
it too much! It should transcend that world

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:11.420
of Reason. I don’t know why, but I want
to keep looking at it, I want to keep listening

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.440
to it, that is the indication of probably
the next level, the Black Belt of Love. Earworm,

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:23.569
they call it. There is a word like that in
English. Some piece of music that just sticks

00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:28.701
to you. Go to the bathroom, you keep hearing
it. It echoes as you travel in the bus. You

00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:35.779
will not be able to stop humming it in your
mind. It is almost as if a worm is caught

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:43.410
inside your ear. So, it is an earworm. This
is probably a sentenceworm. Be blessed!

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:49.980
Shruthika:- So, this is from 407 too. By Blender
Forever. “There are a few quotidians that

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.589
just completely suck me in like a black hole
and this is one of them. Here is a quote by

00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:59.759
Confucius, that resembles the content of this
episode. We have two lives, and the second

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.600
begins when we realise we only have one”.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.100
Raj:- Isn’t that amazing? Yeah.. By the
way, Blender Forever is even more amazing.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:16.860
He has been a long-time follower and commenter
at my channel. He is, I think a hacker too.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:25.860
And he sent me, this. It is a website, which
is like a calendar for Quotidians. You go

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:32.689
to that page any time, any day, it will tell
you when the next Quotidian is! Also, if you

00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:41.339
go back in time, all older Quotidians are
linked! So, a great interface… a labour

00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:48.450
of love he has created. I don’t know what
his real name is. I don’t know his face.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.660
But, I hope some day he will … I am saying
it is him.. what if it is a she…

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.660
Shruthika:- Could be…

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.680
Raj:- Could be YOU! Not you? Not you!

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.670
Shruthika:- I am going to keep it a secret…!

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:05.780
Raj:- So, we don’t know who this person
is… thank you! Thank you for doing this!

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.890
Shruthika:- Thank you so much, Blender Forever,
I am sure it will definitely be helpful for

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:16.520
all of us. This is from 409, a torrent of
ideas. Lakshman says, “Perfect Ten, Another

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.480
Idea. All the ten ideas could be a Quotidian
topic. Thank you!”

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:27.329
Raj:- He has leaked my secret! While I am
working on one, I have a parallel chat channel

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:32.610
with my colleagues… Hashtag FutureQ! is
what I call it. It means, we have begun here,

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:39.130
there is much to share about this, no time,
I will probably address this in a later Quotidian!

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:44.390
You have stolen my trade secret, Mr. Lakshman!

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:50.649
Shruthika:- So, we have come to the end. I
would like to add a small note here.. So,

00:17:50.649 --> 00:17:56.780
it is really fascinating how you come up with
ideas. I was watching Victory’s Defeat and

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.780
Defeat’s Victory…

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.870
Raj:- Oh, that, The Winning Way…

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:06.190
Shruthika:- As an intro, you were talking
about Kobe Bryant, and his record, how many

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.410
shots he had missed… and I was wondering,
what would this intro lead me to… and I

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:17.760
saw the topic and later I saw the connection,
and it was like, oh my god, this is so amazing!

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.890
And the way you fish out for ideas everywhere,
I have seen this in our classes too, when

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.059
we do our bookreading sessions, you sometimes
read some stuff, and say, Hey, this is a great

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:29.059
idea for Quotidian!

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:31.340
Raj:- Oh, you remember that too!

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.649
Shruthika:- I was really fascinated with all
that…

00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:45.549
Raj:- Oh, okay, I will actually let you in
on a secret here. What you see as a Quotidian,

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:53.830
is not conceived linearly. Probably the idea
for the 14th slide comes, and I share that

00:18:53.830 --> 00:19:01.710
with my colleagues, and we create something
that’s woven around it, something from somewhere,

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.060
something from somewhere else, and one of
them says, this doesn’t look good, and all

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.029
that, and that’s how it develops… In fact,
you know what is the last thing that’s done

00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:12.470
for a Quotidian? The Intro!!

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.470
Shruthika:- OHHH!!

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:19.659
Raj:- What do I do..? We need to attract these
folks! We can’t play a song in the beginning,

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.330
spin around like Doordarshan, and still hope
to hold on to the fleeting attention span

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.010
of our viewers! We know you will leave! That
is why, right off the bat, like it happens

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.289
in Vijay Sethupathi movies, … they kill
him in the first scene, usually. And then,

00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:31.570
the story develops, whaaat? The hero is gone
already? But then, he comes, and comes again,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:39.600
and comes again and again, like in flashback
sequences till the very last scene.. He will

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.279
be there right through the movie, but the
first scene, he will die! And so, I thought,

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:51.380
similarly, I should introduce something that
has an indirect tangential connection to the

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:59.150
whole theme, and that is conceived last, not
first! Yeah! Alright then, so, we come to

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:14.640
the end of 410. Coming soon is 411, and until
then, Namaste!
