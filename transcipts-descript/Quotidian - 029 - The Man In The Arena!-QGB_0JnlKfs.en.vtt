00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.320
Namaste!

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.000
A secret, may I?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.200
I almost gave up!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.970
It is the twenty-ninth day today.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.630
But… as you can see in this chat conversation
with a friend, I almost gave up.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.740
Not because i didn’t have fun thing to share,
any junk to share… but… lack of time..

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.960
other sorts of pressures..

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.109
I almost gave up.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.500
I was not in mood.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.470
I was thinking about this, and that’s when
this really beautiful poem titled

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.070
“The Man In The Arena” came to mind — by
Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.280
The United States of America.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.390
In one of this speeches, he recites this.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.280
In that poem, a small snippet, it is a long
one, please read it in full, but look at that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.699
last line, it is especially good.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.489
The person who tries and loses… actually
wins over the person who never even tries

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.100
in the first place.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.190
If he fails, at least he fails while daring
greatly, so that his place shall never be

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.430
with those cold and timid souls who neither
know victory nor defeat.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.900
The ones who sit in the stands, eating popcorn…

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.860
what does HE know?

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.000
We keep mocking that Dhoni was run out in
the World Cup semi final, but has this guy

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.890
in the stands taken a single run?

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.350
That is the point.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.960
Thanks to Covid, one can see quite a lot of
scenes like this..

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.470
Nobody in the stadium.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.780
There is only one man in the arena, and he
is in the stands!

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:51.130
But, … on the Internet, there was this meme
that went quite famous for a while.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.350
Wrung my heart, really.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.250
The size of your audience doesn’t matter.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.510
Keep up the good work!

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.510
This was the accompanying picture.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.440
But, it would have been tolerable if it had
featured a boy, playing his flute.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.440
Practising.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.090
But, actually, the picture that came was this.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.740
There was only that one cat.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.960
Would have been his pet cat.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.540
Probably waiting for the boy to finish playing
and feed the daily morsel.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.110
There is nobody else to listen.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.720
But, if there is nobody else to listen, do
you still practise?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.700
Do you still play to an audience of one?

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.310
Or, are you greedy?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.480
Why was I out of mood?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.550
Because I didn’t get two more comments?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.490
That only three hundred people had watched
my video?

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.430
That was the question in my mind.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.850
This is Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.330
The first people to climb Mount Everest.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.800
When I was thinking about this, I kept asking
the question in my mind.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.820
Are they the first people to climb Mount Everest,
OR…. were they the first recorded, documented,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.230
photographed people to climb Mount Everest.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.590
So, the most important climbing equipment?

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.590
Not the pickaxe!

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.790
Not the snowshoe!

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.790
Camera!

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.710
You need proof that you summitted, yes?

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.310
Think about that!

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.590
Meet Raji!

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.510
She’s a good friend of mine.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.040
And, she’s been doing this for five years
now.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.350
She has seventy six cover songs, that she
has sung, animated pictures, background music,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.350
and karaoke.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.810
Five years, she has been doing it.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.350
That is the link you have to go to, to listen
to those songs.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.090
And, she didn’t stop there.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.190
Last year, late last year, she started a Kolam
series.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.950
The Rangoli series.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.470
And she has crossed one hundred kolams.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.500
She has got more kolams out there than subscribers.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.490
She hasn’t got her hundredth subscriber
yet.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.760
She has got more kolams.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.720
More videos.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.730
https://bit.ly/rajikolams is the link you
have to visit.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.810
So, I asked her.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.990
What motivates you?

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.930
What happened when nobody comes?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.959
I don’t even look at that data, she says.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.870
I do it because I like doing it.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.530
I do it because there is something inside
me that wants to come out.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.610
Incidentally, I record it.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.240
That’s all, she says.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.650
There used to be this old saw that went, “If
a tree falls in a forest, and…if there were

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.290
nobody around to hear it.. will it make a
noise..?”

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.900
A question like that.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.910
A paradoxical puzzle of sorts.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:54.520
As I dwell deeper on that question…, I am
reminded of this flower.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.600
The Edelweiss.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.530
The National Symbol of Switzerland.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.750
A fragrant flower.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.970
A beautiful flower.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.650
Grows only in the peaks of the Swiss Alps.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.890
You can see them growing ONLY THERE.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:17.230
What is the point, in a place where nobody
is there, a place nobody frequents, why does

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.520
such a beautiful flower grow there…, well,
if the flower has a mouth, it would perhaps

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.780
say:- “The place I am in, I take a peek.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.090
I see the beauty of the world that surrounds
me.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.100
I enjoy it.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.280
Without my knowledge, almost uncontrollably,
my joy and my pleasure pour forth as a beautiful

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.030
blossom” — who knows!

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.090
The outpouring of the joy inside the soul!

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:58.840
By the way, I didn’t tell you..

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.660
The Raji that I introduced?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.699
She is my sister!

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:04.909
Thank you!
