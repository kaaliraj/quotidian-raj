00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:09.080
A book titled “Great Boss, Dead Boss”
— a friend recommended that I read this

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.780
book, he told me he had found it interesting.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.849
I haven’t read THAT book yet.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.519
But, along very similar lines, I read another
book titled “That Boss” / “This Boss" and we are going to see a few excerpts from that book!

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.239
Namaste!

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.542
“Nalla Mudhalaali, Enga Mudhalaali” — isn’t
that how that popular song goes?

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:52.760
So, there is this book, called “Good Boss,
Bad Boss”.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.020
We have seen this author before — Robert
Sutton.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.940
We saw him in the “No Asshole Rule”.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.470
We have seen a few excerpts from that other
book.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.590
The same person who wrote that book, he has
come up with another interesting book..

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.140
This book was so interesting, any random page
you jump into, just pick any page you want,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.760
and voila, you would find four useful tips,
you would find one interesting story, you

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.240
can internalise it, implement it, that day!

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.420
Whether you are a Boss, whether you are working
under a Boss, or whether you are going to

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.190
soon become a Boss, there is a lot you can
learn from this book.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:50.400
I am going to just cherrypick a few interesting
aspects from this, and share them with you.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.320
Do you remember this scene?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.420
In The Mahabharatha?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.970
Author Shri Jeyamohan has been retelling this
story under the title “Venmurasu”.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.540
I have been reading it with my Mom, one chapter
a day.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:14.430
And, very recently, we passed through that
really disheartening phase, where Draupadi

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.140
is insulted in public.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.560
I really don’t know if it was Draupadi who
was insulted, or all of Indian Culture.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.960
But, that is what happened.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:29.510
A couple of chapters after that, after all
is said and done, and after much regret, much

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.200
fighting, much anger, at the end of it all,
when they are introspecting about it, Dharma,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.440
Yudhishtra, makes a very interesting observation.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.910
He says, “I have committed unpardonable
sins.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.450
I shouldn’t have gambled.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.820
And, more important, I shouldn’t have placed
my wife as the wager.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:59.640
But, even from such a disaster, I think I
am able to garner a little benefit.”…

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.900
He continues.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.670
“I learned what people really thought about
me.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.940
Eldest brother among five.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.480
I am the king of Hasthinapuri.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.680
Everybody had already labeled me ‘Dharma’
(The Righteous).

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.790
I could do no wrong.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.150
I am the big boss.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.790
I am the incarnation of God himself.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.970
That is what they called me.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.610
Praised me no end.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.860
And, made me float in false pride.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.990
And, only when this happened, people opened
their mouths.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.650
The subjects in the court started commenting.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.950
My younger brothers, who never ever crossed
my line, the line I drew, they shouted at

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.950
me.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.940
Only then did I realise all the mistakes I
was committing.” he says.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.010
“My wife too.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.940
I have never seen her talk back at me like
that.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.380
That is when I learned.”

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.950
So, as a boss, this is something you are going
to find very difficult.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:20.370
What is it like to work with a person like
this guy, or this woman?

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.310
Find a way to somehow understand that.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.830
More often than not, you are seen as a jerk,
says Robert Sutton.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.051
How are you going to avoid that perception?

00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:38.051
Take care!

00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:39.570
There is this book called The Inner Game of
Tennis.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:49.200
And another book, exactly like this one, featuring
another sport, called Zen in the Art of Archery.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.710
In both these books, the essence is the same.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.110
The focus is not on hitting the ball with
the racquet or piercing the target with the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.110
arrow.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.110
No.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.810
That is NOT the focus.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.640
The effort that you have to spend is in the
little things.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:15.880
The positioning of the feet, the planning
of where to move to at the same time the opponent

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.870
is swinging his racquet, realising what surface
we are playing on, sensing the direction and

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:30.760
speed of the wind, being perfectly relaxed
when the bow is pulled taut, being perfectly

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:41.410
balanced, if you focus on all these the right
way, if you do these perfectly, you don’t

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:48.230
even need to see the ball, or see the target,
if you release, it will hit the target!

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.810
Both the books echo this same philosophy.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:59.250
Do the process very well, the results will
automatically happen.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.340
The little advice that I would like to take
away from this?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.449
As a boss, you don’t need to always float
in the clouds or always have big dreams, and

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.490
think of motivating your team with some lofty
goals.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:24.610
Little things done well, day to day things
done well, they will perform the magic and

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.740
surprise you — says Robert Sutton.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.890
The thousand little things matter more than
that one big thing.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.020
Many people make the mistake of forgetting
about these thousand little things.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.420
In Baahubali, do you remember Sivakami Devi?

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:49.290
“Idhuvey En Kattalai, En Kattalaiye Saasanam”…

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.120
Are you going to be assertive like that?

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:59.199
When are the times you are going to allow
other people to probably have second opinions?

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:05.510
And when are the times you are going to rule
with an iron hand?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:11.300
Probably that is the hardest art to master
— says Robert Sutton.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:20.240
If you look at the robot hand, you have to
hold on to it, you can’t let it slip.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.000
You can’t hold on too tightly too.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It might break.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.210
That is the logic which is the hardest to
do when doing the algorithms for the grip

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.009
of the metal fingers of a prosthetic hand,
it seems.

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:36.240
Management is pretty similar.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.100
How do you manage?

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.580
How do you convince people?

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.800
How do you persuade them?

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.930
Without making them feel you are ruling with
an iron hand…

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.460
You have to wear a velvet glove. — he says.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.320
Some of you may remember this story.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.759
A person is having a conversation with God.

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:03.680
Of how he noticed the footsteps of God walking
alongside him, as he walked his life path.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.840
He thanks God for the company, but then, he
complains.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.520
“I was very sad, devastated, at a point
in my life.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.979
Suffered too much, battered, struggling, all
alone.

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:12.370
Where were you at that time?

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.360
I could see only one set of footprints in
the sand.” he asks God.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.160
His response is poignant, though.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.650
“I was with you all along,” He says, “…and
seeing you suffer too much, I decided to raise

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:31.870
you over to my back and carry you along for
a while”.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.870
This…

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.099
Being the Human Shield is something every
manager should master.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:47.019
Or, even worse, they could be barbs from from
top management.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:49.720
How are you going to be that Human Shield??

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.610
How will you be the protective fort, how will
you be the human shield, to protect, and ensure

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:03.439
they get to do their work without distractions
and disturbances — that is an art you have

00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:08.089
to master if you want to be a good Manager!

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:11.910
He then talks about two important phrases.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.889
The first one is “Creative Incompetence”.

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:18.629
We have seen about the Imposter Syndrome.

00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:19.629
Incompetence…

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:21.559
Probably I don’t know how to do this.

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:24.350
Probably I will never be able to do this.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.379
Others don’t know this yet, but I am not
actually competent in this…

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:30.720
That Imposter Syndrome — Try turning it
around.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.279
How about looking at yourself as incompetent
in something that you are actually proficient

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.279
in!

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:41.519
That is the path to learning constantly.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.670
Becoming better every day.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.839
So, start with a stance that says “Am I
such an idiot that I don’t know I am an

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:49.660
idiot”?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.509
That is the phrase he uses.

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:55.569
Be feeling always, that you are incompetent.

00:09:55.569 --> 00:10:00.559
That is Creative Incompetence.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:01.559
That is another tip he gives.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:09.199
The second very useful phrase that I gathered
from this book was something called Malicious

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:10.199
Compliance.

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:11.199
What is Compliance?

00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:17.240
Ok, is this the process, is this the rule?

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.592
Okay, I shall do it as you say.

00:10:19.592 --> 00:10:20.592
Malicious?

00:10:20.592 --> 00:10:21.610
Something that could lead to trouble.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.680
Something that could damage.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.089
So, in this picture here, the brother wants
his sister to save a little bit of everything.

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:31.779
And, her sister is performing malicious compliance!

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:33.839
In a small paper plate, she lines up small
crumbs of bread, corn, pea, ham, … Isn’t

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:38.800
that what you wanted me to do?!

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.839
Malicious Compliance.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.600
Here is another example.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:50.499
If you break this seal, it automatically means
you have agreed to the End User License Agreement…

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:51.499
says the cover.

00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:58.899
But, our genius has sliced the bottom side
open, and extracted the CD..!

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:01.040
What is this trying to convey?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.529
What does Malicious Compliance really mean
here?

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:10.739
It means, as a boss, sometimes, you MAY have
to follow processes.

00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:17.600
You MAY have to do some routines and some
regular stuff.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.089
And it is actually detrimental to your team.

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:22.370
It is being an obstacle.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.730
How are you going to escalate it, and report
it to top management?

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.470
You cannot say “I won’t comply!”

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.480
So, comply to the letter.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.829
Do exactly as told.

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:41.839
Demonstrate the dangerous side-effects of
doing so, to your top management!

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.600
Make them understand!

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600
Beware!

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.829
This is pretty risky behaviour!

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:49.660
This is when I should also be adding “Don’t
try this at home”!

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:56.019
But, I thought this was a very powerful phrase,
to absorb from this book.

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:57.029
Malicious Compliance.

00:11:57.029 --> 00:12:01.679
There was this king called King Canute.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:04.839
Many many many years ago.

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:06.410
In England.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.779
The courtiers used to praise him too much.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:11.379
You are the best.

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:13.379
You are the greatest.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:15.110
You are the world’s most amazing king.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:20.759
One day, he asked them to take him to the
seashore, and took all his subjects along,

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:24.819
and he asked to be placed on his throne, at
the water’s edge.

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:26.279
And he asked, “What do you guys think?

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:28.389
That incoming tide, .. twice a day..

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:32.299
Do you think I can stop it by ordering it
to stop?”

00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:37.189
And the courtiers responded with, “Of course,
nothing or nobody can violate your word.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:39.110
Of course it will stop!”.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.430
Okay, he said, and tried stopping it.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.899
It didn’t work.

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:49.430
The water slowly came in, high tide, and wet
his feet.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:56.769
He turned around towards everybody and spoke,
“All ye dimwits, do you understand now?

00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:58.899
There is only one God..

00:12:58.899 --> 00:12:59.990
Up above.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.529
I am not all-powerful as you think”.

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:13.450
So, one of the things a manager has to tell
himself or herself is, “Be bold enough,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:18.670
courageous enough, strong enough, to face
any criticism.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:27.190
But be also, realistic enough, practical enough,
humble enough, to know you are not all-powerful”.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.930
Again, it is a toss-up.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.720
When I hear the word “Toss up”, I am reminded
of Quotidian 371.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:40.790
In this, we saw about being liberal or being
conservative.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:48.170
Another beautiful lesson from this book is
“Fight as if you are right, listen as if

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.170
you are wrong!”

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.689
What you give outside, what you receive inside.

00:13:53.689 --> 00:13:54.869
Listen as if you are wrong.

00:13:54.869 --> 00:14:01.560
When you are giving out your opinion, of course
you will have to be bold, you have to be insightful,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.619
you have to be pretty confident about it.

00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:06.529
But, have you done talking?

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:08.660
Are you receiving opinions from the others?

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:14.429
Start then from the vantage point of “Probably
you are wrong!”

00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:22.619
In the Viet Nam war, when the Americans were
fighting there, they had all these funny acronyms.

00:14:22.619 --> 00:14:25.510
Situation Normal All Fouled Up.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.889
(There is another word too, for F..

00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:28.920
Be my guest!)

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.509
Situation Unchanged, Still Fouled Up.

00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:35.860
Totally And Royally Fouled Up.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.100
Fouled Up Beyond Belief.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.529
Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:45.509
There is a BOHICAL — I will let you Google
for it yourself!

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:48.649
So, mistakes will always happen.

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:51.490
Situation Normal — All Fouled Up.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:58.939
So, how does a manager handle, when somebody
in their team commits a mistake?

00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:05.619
Mistakes can happen in one of three ways.

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:06.619
The first way?

00:15:06.619 --> 00:15:08.249
Well, it could be an Accident.

00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:09.249
By mistake.

00:15:09.249 --> 00:15:10.249
Unexpectedly.

00:15:10.249 --> 00:15:14.139
In that case, try to understand if there is
a Process Failure.

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:20.699
The person who did the mistake is not to be
blamed completely, if it were an accident.

00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:24.179
Check if you can put a process in place to
ensure such an accident doesn’t recur ever.

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:27.559
That should be your focus.

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:31.629
What is the other reason a problem could have
happened?

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:35.639
He may not, she may not, KNOW how to do that
work.

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:36.639
Inability.

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:39.339
I don’t have the capacity to do it.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:43.250
I am not skilled enough.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.240
Are they to be blamed for it?

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.769
It is you, as the manager, who should take
the Training effort seriously!

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:52.089
Before delegating, teach!

00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:55.929
That is again pointing back at you, the Manager.

00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:57.699
Oh yeah, there could be this third reason.

00:15:57.699 --> 00:15:59.630
There could be Evil Intent.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:05.679
Just to get you a bad name, just to denigrate
the company and its brand, there may be miscreants

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:07.119
trying to do this.

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:08.749
EVEN THAT, points back at you.

00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:10.689
Because, guess who recruited them in the first
place?

00:16:10.689 --> 00:16:14.040
It was you who handpicked them!

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.170
Interviewed them!

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.989
So, search well, spot well!

00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:22.589
It finally comes back to you.

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:32.389
When you see somebody making a mistake, analyse,
look inwards, and find a solution for that.

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:37.139
And finally, Mahatma Gandhi’s quotation
comes to mind.

00:16:37.139 --> 00:16:42.749
That the Bad is much stronger than the Good.

00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:49.410
It is not about what amazing superstars you
have in your team.. that is going to determine

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.180
how high your team rises..

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.559
What are the bad apples in your team?

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:58.350
What are the ones who are going to bring your
team down?

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:05.040
That little drop of poison that will spoil
the whole bowl of milk… obsess about those

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040
little drops.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.040
Locate them.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040
Remove them!

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.290
Also, it could be inwards.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.390
It is okay even if you don’t have any amazing
good qualities!

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:20.839
But first, chase out those few BAD qualities
you have inside you.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:27.610
That is another way to look at it too!

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.270
What is the closing thought here?

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.620
I have been talking about “boss, boss, boss”
all along.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:40.300
But, frankly speaking, “Boss” is such
a hated word in my vocabulary.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.210
I hate it when somebody calls me, “Boss…”!

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:50.170
Today, while researching for this video, I
started understanding where that hatred was

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.240
coming from!

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:58.320
I went looking for the etymology for the word.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.210
Boss is from a Dutch word.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.210
“baas”.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.420
And, what does that mean?

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.000
A slave-driver.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.450
A master who whips his slaves to obedience.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.100
That is the root-word for “boss”.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.100
Master.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.100
I am a slave.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.100
Bid me.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.630
I will do what you say.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.630
No!

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.830
That’s not what we want to be!

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.900
We want to be leaders!

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.760
And, who is a leader?

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:32.300
He leads the way, into danger, into trouble,
into opportunities and challenges.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.300
He shows the way.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.260
He leads.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:41.740
Prefer to be a Leader, than to be a Hated
Boss.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.159
Thank you!
