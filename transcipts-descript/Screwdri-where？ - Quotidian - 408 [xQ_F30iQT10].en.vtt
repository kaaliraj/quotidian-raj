00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.340
I came across this book very recently.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.280
One Good Turn.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.970
A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the
Screw.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.849
Something really interesting popped out of
it, while I was there.

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:27.670
It says, the Screw, the concept of the Screw,
and something that binds, perhaps wood to

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.219
wood, such a thing, has been around from 200
B.C..

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.350
B.C!

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.729
But, do you know when this guy came along?!

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.079
1500 A.D!

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:55.190
For nearly 1700 years, mankind was just sitting
around with Screws!

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.550
Without a Screwdriver!

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.039
Think about it!

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.910
Namaste!

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.780
Screwdri-where?!

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:24.270
Where is YOUR screwdriver!

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.730
I want to tell you two stories today.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.660
The first one, is from Apple!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.660
Apple..

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.660
Screws?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.450
Well, please don’t misunderstand.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.720
Or, wait.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.980
Go ahead.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.250
Misunderstand this.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.410
For, they perhaps deserve this!

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.470
There were so many different types of screws.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.090
Small, large, star, hexagonal, flat-head,
flanged, there were many different types.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.510
Machines have been around, devices have been
around, metal to metal connections, plastic

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.250
fastenings, have been around!

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.739
But, do you know what Apple did when it launched
the iPhone 4?

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.569
There is this fastening point right at the
bottom.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.709
Two screws.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.709
Near the speakers.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:28.121
Suddenly, one fine day, all new phones that
are manufactured from now on will have the

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:31.430
pentalobe screwhead, they declared!

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.750
What was that again?!

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.069
It resembles a flower.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.069
Pentalobe.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.709
There was no real reason for Apple to move
to the Pentalobe.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.890
Because, if this were the best screw in the
world, well, why didn’t they change the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.889
screws inside the body too to this type?

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:53.889
No!

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:01.120
Or, if this were the world standard in screws,
well, they would have been easily available!

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.349
The screw and the screwdriver would have been
easily available!

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.829
No!

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:14.560
People started realising, or at least, people
started blaming that Apple was choosing this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:26.029
screwhead for the Mac, for the iPad, for the
iPhone, only because they didn’t want people

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.260
to DIY repair it!

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.879
The folks who say, well, let me open it up
myself, let me check things out, oh, it is

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.409
just this thing to be replaced, oh, only the
screen is cracked, oh, it is just battery

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.409
replacement…

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.700
they didn’t want you to touch it.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.870
They wanted you to bring it back.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.709
In fact, when they brought it back, they realised
one more thing!

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:59.669
Old phones, when they pass through Apple Repair,
and come back to the customer, screws magically

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.799
became pentalobe!

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.739
Old screws were removed, and they were moving
to pentalobe!

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.469
These were the headlines that raged then!

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:16.350
Apple “screwing” new iPhones out of simple
DIY repair!

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.840
The pentalobe screws saga: How Apple locked
up your iPhone 4!

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.210
Is Apple working on next-gen screw to keep
users out of devices?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.620
Apple is famous for this.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.150
Long ago, when Apple revealed the original
Macintosh, they had a sealed unit!

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.480
Forget screws!

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.320
This one was SEALED!

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.900
You could not open it.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.800
No user-serviceable parts inside.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.850
Don’t meddle with it.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.850
It is pristine!

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.120
You can see this, in the world of software
too!

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.560
In the world of software, the first iPhone,
didn’t even have an App Store!

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.540
Steve Jobs famously said:- “I don’t want
any Apps built by third party people.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.430
If we need anything, we will build it ourselves”!

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.910
But, interestingly, there was this OTHER Steve,
who cofounded Apple, Steve Wozniak is his

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.070
name, he says:- “There is this inalienable
right called Right To Repair!

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.040
It is unfair to lock people out like this!

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.750
You need to encourage them to do-it-themselves!

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:33.390
If only we hadn’t got it all out in the
open, Apple wouldn’t have happened!

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.280
And, I remember, when I launched Apple I,
along with the hardware, we published full

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.270
schematics and diagrams!

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.080
Anybody else could redo the Apple!”

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.850
Compare that open world to the one today,
where a screw, or even a screwdriver is made

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.960
very hard to get, for no real reason!

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.930
You might have seen this beautiful picture.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.300
Inside the Mac.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.710
Inside the Macbook Pro.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.550
How beautifully laid out, how tightly packed,
neatly setup.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.080
But, did you read the fine print?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.360
There’s a little sticker that says, “Warranty
void, if seal broken”.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:24.520
Sorry, no refunds if you do stuff without
asking me first!

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.230
This is one kinda story.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.920
The second story I want to tell you, is about
a guy from Apple!

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.020
This man is Tony Fadell.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.400
His first great contribution to humanity?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.610
He invented the iPod.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.460
The original classic iPod with the clickwheel?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.940
It was his baby.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.960
And then, remember the other device they brought
out, that looked so much like the iPod?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.070
The iPhone!

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.920
He was part of the team there.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.371
About 400 people were reporting to him.

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:06.900
The crucial hardware design of the iPhone
received big contributions from him.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:14.630
After the iPhone was launched, things settled
down, and Tony Fadell moved out of Apple.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.550
And, do you know what he started doing?

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.670
He started building Nest.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.830
Nest is the company he later sold to Google,
and Nest is basically a thermostat.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.080
Remember the heaters, coolers, and airconditioning
at home?

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:40.300
To set them, to save energy, to add some smartness
to the whole thing, to bring about a connected

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.070
home environment in the long term, he founded
Nest.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.230
(What a nice name!)

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.010
He started it up thus!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:56.130
The story I am telling you now is about Nest
and what he did with it!

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.470
Like everybody else, when he created the product,
he created personas.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:11.660
Users of this product, would probably be a
husband, a wife, a guy and a lady.. he started

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.660
thinking.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.660
Benji, the guy!

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660
(Almost resembles Tony Fadell!)

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.660
And, Beth, the lady.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.470
And, whenever there is a persona, there are
characteristics that are ascribed to them.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.210
He gave these characteristics to them.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.190
The classic characteristics.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.280
He said, this guy is into tech.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.120
He understands tech well.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.140
While, that lady loves beauty.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:40.700
Knows how to appreciate aesthetics and recognise
beauty.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.190
This guy — he loves his iPhone.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.440
If we can do something with an iPhone, if
we can meddle with something, if we can monitor,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:56.550
manage, manipulate something, he is the guy
who puts up his hand first!

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.550
This lady?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.900
Anything new, she is skeptical!

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.710
Anything she hasn’t seen elsewhere, anything
her neighbours don’t have, she doesn’t

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.590
want to risk it!

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.510
He is looking for cool new stuff.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.520
What can I do that is new?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.040
What can I have that nobody else has?

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.990
When can I adopt?

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.190
He wants to be the early adopter.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.880
Unfortunately, in most households, including
mine!, this is true.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.800
She is the decision-maker!

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.140
Will we eventually buy it or not?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.150
Will it come home or not?

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.690
Will we use it daily or not?

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.890
She is the decision-maker.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:46.270
So, with a dichotomy like this, even if Benji
goes to the shop and brings a Nest home, and

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:52.970
says, “We are going to install Nest thermostats
in our house”, if Beth is going to comment,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.090
“What on earth did you buy for the home?

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:04.690
Why on earth is it so complicated to set up”
etc, the lady will have the final say, the

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:10.180
device might not even come home, or, worse,
having come home, it may be returned to the

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.180
shop!

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:17.570
So, Tony started sending samples to the households
that had Beth and Benji in them!

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.970
Please try and let us know.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.370
Tell us if you like it.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.170
Tell us if you DON’T like it!

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.590
And he collected feedback.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.580
He thought, it should be very easy.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.580
Easy-peasy!

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.890
There is nothing hard about it.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.890
The device is simple.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.390
You just need to identify where to place it.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.280
The schematic is given, very beautifully,
simply.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.810
Some four / five wires.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:51.060
You have to connect red to red, green to green.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.320
That would be all!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.730
Screw the top.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.730
Tighten it.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.950
Set it up on the wall!

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.510
That’s all!

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.810
They collected data.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.300
How was the experience..

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.850
He says, it is not about the product.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.390
It is about the product onboarding experience.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.930
From the moment the person watches an advertisement,
to the moment he actually purchases the product

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.510
at the shop, to the trip home, the grand unboxing
moment, and the final moment when we say,

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.490
“Everything is set up now, we can now switch
it on!”

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.690
— this whole gamut is the comprehensive
onboarding experience.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:30.490
He says it is so important!

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.060
This is the final thing you do, you connect
it with your iPhone, and you are all set,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:40.210
and even before you come home, you can start
your A/C.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:48.470
He collected information and realised that
people said it took one hour to complete the

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.470
installation.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.470
“What?

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.470
One hour?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.470
For something as simple as this?”

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.470
— He was shocked, and he dug deeper.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:12:02.460
And, they found out that 30 of those 60 minutes,
they were spent rummaging in that messy drawer…

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.460
every house has one.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.420
I am sure yours is like this too!

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.690
And, in that drawer, they wasted those thirty
minutes..

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.800
Looking for that particular screwdriver to
screw on this particular screwhead.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.800
It is good-looking.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.800
It is small.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.820
And, they are not able to use any other random
screwdriver on it.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.750
They spend half an hour, searching!

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.630
“Oh, fine, thank God, it is not our mistake.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.910
It is his problem…

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.980
Let us tell our customers, actually, in thirty
minutes you can set it all up easily”, was

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.400
NOT what Tony Fadell thought.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.589
He didn’t sweep the problem off the table,
summarily.

00:12:32.589 --> 00:12:35.170
He said, how can we innovate?

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.420
How can we make it a customer-delight point?

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.220
And, this is what he did!

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.339
He invented a screwdriver!

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:49.310
Handy, almost sexy-looking!

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.880
With the required head.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.330
In fact, not just the required head.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.710
He threw in four more heads.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.710
Here, take this!

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.690
Even if you want to hang something else around
the house, use our screwdriver.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.690
Handy.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.690
Branded.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:06.980
With a magnetic grip.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.980
Perfectly snug-fitting.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:15.570
Something that seems to be irresistible, drawing
you to hold it in your hand!

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.740
Here is a screwdriver!

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.230
This cost him money!

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.190
At a time when they were all trying to reduce
the cost price of the product, this was five

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.000
to six dollars of additional cost.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.730
People complained, they didn’t want him
to do it..

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:38.050
But, he said, this is a great opportunity
for brand recognition and customer delight,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:43.430
and surely, every Nest going out will have
this Nest Screwdriver!

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:48.780
Which will be used for other things too!

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.230
How beautiful!!

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:59.820
So, my closing thought is, “Which screwdriver
are you going to use?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:06.970
Apple’s Pentalobe or the Nest Screwdriver?!”

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.120
Until we meet again, thank you!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:16.589
We have encountered some interesting stories
about Apple already.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:20.430
