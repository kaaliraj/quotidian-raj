00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.680
In English, there are these two words — Marketer,
Marketeer.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.049
Many dictionaries say they are the same, you
can use them interchangeably..!

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.520
What do you think?!

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:27.679
For me, though, the “..eer” ending always
reminds me of words like “Commandeer”

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:42.039
(it is a negative connotation — “take
possession of something by force”..) and

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:49.629
“Racketeer” (“a person who engages in
fraudulent and dishonest dealings”)…

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.920
So, I prefer the word “Marketer”..

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.550
Anyway, who is a Marketer, and how should
that person Market?

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:17.860
A person has highlighted it so beautifully,
and that is what we are going to see today!

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:28.670
Namaste!

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.260
Marketing it…

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.579
Marketing needs some good marketing, says
this author!

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:43.799
It has got a bad name, it has lost its original
purpose and intent.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.040
It needs some marketing!

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.590
Who is he?

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.130
Let us see!

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.860
Firstly, take this shoe.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.770
This Nike shoe.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.700
Nike Air is the brand.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:10.729
If Nike shoes went into the hotel business,
.. if, hypothetically, we know how it is going

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.729
to look like.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.650
It will be extremely comfortable.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.440
Extremely trendy, stylish.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.519
High technology will be squeezed into it somehow,
somewhere.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.140
Cost would be skyhigh..

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:34.459
But, if Nike enters the hotel business too,
the Nike brand value will permeate.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:45.100
On the other hand, if we were to go to the
Hyatt Hotels, and look around, take it in,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.510
… and, just guess, imagine, how would Hyatt
Shoes look like?

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.510
Do you think you will be able to identify
the characteristics?

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.450
They call it the “Blind Test”.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.060
Blind tasting.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.799
Two bottles.

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.260
Both having red-colored fizzy drinks.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.300
Which one is Coke, which one is Thumbs Up?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.300
Remember that ad?

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.810
The Blind Test.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.220
Do you think Hyatt will pass it?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.010
Any up-market, seven-star hotel, looks the
same..

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.629
like any other hotel.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:38.230
Hyatt has a logo, Nike has a brand..!

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.640
Seth Godin crystallises it thus..

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.870
Pay attention to this long sentence, I have
colored in some words too.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:58.650
Brand Value — It is just the “Sum total
of how much extra people will pay, or how

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:16.530
often they choose, the expectations, the memories,
stories and relationships of one brand over

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.530
the alternatives..”

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.040
Letterman had a show on Netflix.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.220
The title itself said, “My next guest needs
no introduction”!

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.630
This too is about brand value, I think.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:39.600
A famous speaker, I was attending his keynote
recently, and the emcee was about to deliver

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.860
the introduction about the speaker.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:53.479
This man came on stage and said, “If a speaker
needs an introduction, he’s not good enough

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.300
to be on stage.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.790
If a speaker is good enough to be on stage,
he needs no introduction!”

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.650
That, again, is Brand Value!

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:15.910
Once upon a time, during the Industrial Age,
it was all about “I have created so many

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.400
of these widgets..

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.940
Who do I sell it to, who will want to buy
more of it, who will want to benefit from

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.940
it..”

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.600
That era has well and truly ended.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.280
Today, the approach has to be agile.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.569
What do our customers want, what do they need,
what are they looking for, what is their unvoiced

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.090
need..?

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.100
They are feeling it, but they are not vocalising..

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.100
What is THAT need?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.919
That is where Bruce Lee chipped in with “Be
like water”!

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.690
That agile approach.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.650
It is not about making MORE of what you have.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:03.910
But, it is about making what you have BETTER,
so that it suits the changing needs of the

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.600
customer.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.139
Do you see the difference?

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:19.840
Also, if you are in the business of building
software, ethereal stuff, you have no excuse

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.259
to not listen to the customer!

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.139
Because, you can keep changing..

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.380
It is not like a car that can be changed only
once every two years!

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.520
You can change a software product twice in
one day!

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.750
Are you doing it?!

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.330
We have encountered the “Start with Why”
credo many times before.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.820
Today, the customers, they don’t want to
buy your product.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:54.889
They want to know how you build it, and WHY
you even started building it in the first

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:55.889
place.

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.360
That WHY.. they rip the product apart until
they get down to the WHY.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.949
Every product is wrapped in brown, comes in
an Amazon box.

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:10.919
What they want to know is what is your WHY,
and is that aligned with their own WHY.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:16.190
So, how do we find out the purpose?

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.640
As a marketer?

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.520
As a product envisioner?

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.950
This Venn diagram can help.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.199
On one side, we have “Who you are”.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:34.889
What can you do?

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:37.090
Who are you?

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.509
What are your characteristics?

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:39.509
What are your likes and dislikes?

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:40.800
What are your strengths and weaknesses?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.210
On one side..

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.430
On the other side is “Who you serve”..

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.220
Who are you targeting?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.690
Who do you want to do it for?

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.919
Who do you want to serve?

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:58.170
Who you are..?

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.450
In that overlap is “What you stand for”.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.710
You need to stand for something!

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.030
That is core belief.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.190
That is you WHY.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.480
And that is your starting point.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.889
This is Marketing — is the name of the book.

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:22.379
Seth Godin has authored it.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:23.810
He markets marketing.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.289
That is all I can say.

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:28.160
He markets marketing.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:37.630
I want to pick two beautiful examples from
this book.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:47.170
He starts by saying, “Stop being average
salespeople, doing average things, to sell

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.760
average stuff to average people..”

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.550
Who is this person?

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.550
Music Teacher.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.990
Teaches how to play the piano.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.089
But, for whom? To any kid that comes in?

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:05.050
Or, to kids who want to excel in an examination?

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:11.110
Or, to kids who want to become musicians?

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:19.089
Or to kids of parents who want to inculcate
discipline through music?

00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:20.089
Who?

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:21.180
For everybody?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.120
Are you going to teach music to everybody?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.279
No!

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.390
You need to slice and dice!

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.520
To narrowcast!

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:40.630
There is this beautiful poem by Bharathiyaar
in Tamil.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.430
The translation in English goes like,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.000
“Always Foraging For Food,
Trivial Talks That Do No Good,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.900
Suffering Badly At The Heart,
Actions Hurting Others A Lot,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.850
Growing Old With Greying Hair,
Dying A Victim To Death Unfair,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.480
You Thought My Life Will End In Vain,
Like Those Clowns Whom I Disdain?”

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.550
Imagine as if you are marketing?

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.000
The kind of marketing that Seth Godin hates
and criticises?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.270
You will see a lot of similarities between
the two!

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:16.000
You can’t be that average person doing average
stuff to sell average products to average

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
people!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.760
Get out of that lock in!

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.700
What should you do then?

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.700
You have to do work that matters..

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.880
To whom? To people who care!

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:40.390
There is a small group of people who long
for you, who look forward to interacting with

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.910
you, who are waiting for you to give them
their next thrill, .. for those people, can

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.390
you do work that matters?!

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.130
That is the line..

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.899
That is a marketer’s credo.

00:10:54.899 --> 00:11:00.550
He says, take any two axes.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.410
And they should not be related.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.840
One should not be influencing the other.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:11.519
In this case, there is “Security” and
there is “Speed”.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:15.570
Assume you want to transport diamonds, across
cities.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.660
What will you do?

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:25.490
If you are focused on security, yes, diamonds,
and speed of delivery, you will probably go

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.910
for FedEx!

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:33.410
Okay, you are not bothered about speed, but
you are bothered about security..

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.959
What will you do now?

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:38.470
Probably a three-day-courier..

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.470
DTDC.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:44.779
You are not bothered about security, but you
need instant delivery, probably you would

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:46.410
opt for a bike messenger..

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.440
place it in a box and send it over!

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.700
You are neither in a hurry, nor are you obsessed
about safety, what would you do?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:00.519
You would perhaps place it in an envelope
and stick a stamp on it, and be done with

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:01.519
it!

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:06.940
There are always polarising edges..

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.300
Pick any two axes..

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.620
He gives some examples!

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.630
Is it going to be Speed?

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.630
Price?

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.630
Performance?

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.680
Pick one!

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.199
Pick one more!

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:23.470
Any two axes!

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.610
And there, try and place all your competitors..

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:35.160
Some quadrants will already be crowded, but
some places in those four quadrants will be

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:43.129
empty, and that is where you have to start
your product.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:46.660
Because that, is an underserved community.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:53.540
If every quadrant is already crowded, probably
look for other axes!

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.810
He gives a lot of examples, you can come up
with your own.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:06.449
But the point is, pick two orthogonal axes,
and having picked, identify your competitors,

00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:13.250
place them, and there will be an empty spot,
try and build a moat around that empty spot.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.560
Isn’t that cool?!

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.670
He also goes on to say that customers have
three problems.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:27.399
The first one is, they can’t say whether
it is a need or a want..

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:36.930
Whether they need a painkiller or a vitamin.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:44.610
It is the marketer’s job to identify that,
the differentiation, and help them with it.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.530
The second problem that customers have?

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:52.639
They are terrible at inventing new ways to
solve their wants..

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.420
They know they need something.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.199
They know they desire something.

00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:00.730
But, what new ways exist?

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.380
What new approaches can they invent?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.540
They would never be able to tell.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.490
And, that is why they are consumers, they
are not product creators.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:17.380
As a product creator, as an envisioner, as
a visionary, and as a marketer, what is your

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.380
job?

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:24.781
Invent new ways to satisfy their current needs
and wants..

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:28.170
And, there is a third problem that customers
have.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.959
They don’t want the same thing.

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:37.320
A marketer can’t hope to make something
en masse, and hope to give the same thing

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320
to everybody!

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:45.080
That would just mean they simply haven’t
understood the Geoffrey Moore chasm yet!

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.269
There will be early adopters.

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:49.980
There will be laggards.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.839
You will have to build different things for
different people.

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:58.610
And, probably, you will have to stop building
something for everybody.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:07.780
You will have to identify a narrow niche,
and build something world-class for that niche.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:13.839
These are three discoveries he says customers
simply don’t understand.

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:15.389
I hope marketers do!

00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:19.240
We were talking about “Everybody doesn’t
want the same thing” just now..

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.880
But, he adds a small correction too!

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.990
An addendum!

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.990
Beautifully!

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.199
Remember this movie?

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:26.550
Inside Out?

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.570
Emotions?

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.759
He says, “Customers don’t buy your products.

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:34.980
Stop being deluded by that..

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:41.149
It is not for your product, your widget, not
for your lipstick, not for your bottle of

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.970
perfume, not for your iphone.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:43.970
No!

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:50.000
They are coming for some sort of emotion to
be boosted..

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.370
To be added.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.900
To be extended.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.500
To be probably highlighted.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.070
How many emotions are even there?

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.290
Can you even list them?” — he challenges
us.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:06.790
He calls it the “Basket of Desires and Dreams”.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.980
And he hits us with a list of examples.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.949
Choose from these emotions..

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:16.550
Are there any that have been left out?

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.769
Anything not in this list?

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.910
Probably you will be able to add one or two.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.579
You won’t be able to add fifty more.

00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:32.269
Because, right from the Stone Age, for Man,
emotions are a small number of things only.

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:37.540
They want a community perhaps, control perhaps,
they want freedom, they want friendship, they

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:46.360
want safety, they may even want revenge, but,
.. it stays within this emotions-basket.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:56.000
Whoever they are, whatever they wish for,
will fit right in.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.029
So, stop obsessing about your product.

00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:11.230
Look at the emotional need that a person wants
fulfilled and invent new ways for those old

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.799
emotions to be fulfilled.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.760
And, THAT IS YOUR PRODUCT!

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.919
That’s it!

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:18.250
What is your product?

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:22.679
Your product is a new way for your old emotion
to be satisfied!

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:24.919
That’s it!

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.160
Understand that!

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:35.780
As a closing thought, I want to play this
short video first for you.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.160
1984, Apple commercial..

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:45.790
I am sure most of you will recognise this
ad.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:55.179
Remember that scene?

00:17:55.179 --> 00:18:02.280
That lady running in, breaking that huge controlling
scene?

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.940
Apple won the day in 1984 because of one single
purpose.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:15.720
Lee Clow, the person who designed this ad,
has spoken about it too.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:29.650
He has said, “If you don’t stand for something,
you will fall for anything”.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.750
And, customers won’t like you.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.450
Because, they are looking for the why.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:51.309
I hope you got the message, we will meet again
soon, thank you!
