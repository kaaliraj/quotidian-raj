00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.190
Do you remember this little movie?

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.349
The boy is being “adamant”.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.260
He is seeking attention!

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:32.860
He is putting up a great show, seeking attention
too, in the process!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.930
In English, they calling it throwing a temper
tantrum.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.420
I was looking for that word.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.930
Where did it come from?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.760
What is the etymology?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.930
And…

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.440
I was surprised.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.530
Because..

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.649
it seems the origin is disputed..

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.449
Nobody knows who started this off as a word
in what context and why, even though they

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.310
know about its first occurrences.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.949
Some people say it is probably from an ancient
British usage.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.670
It is clearly mentioned here, “unknown origin”.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.670
See?

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:20.680
Some say, Shakespeare referred to a “ghost
animal” in King Lear called the Tantrabobus.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.290
Some, … if a word ends in ‘..um’, they
claim it must be Latin!

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.740
People say it is from there!

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.909
Some people also refer to Tantra, (don’t
ask me too much about it..!) that Tantric..

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.759
Sanskrit word.. but.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.439
Tantra / Tantric in Sanskrit means weaving,
interweaving, intermingling, spinning, .. and

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.470
has no connection between that and tantrum.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.420
Okay, so you are calling it a disputed origin..

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.810
Let me spin you a new yarn!

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.560
I think this is where it comes from!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.969
A word from our own Tamil language!

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:01.969
Thanthiram.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.470
It is a trick deployed by that child, either
knowingly or unknowingly..

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:28.319
And, this is the subject of our talk today!

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.319
Namaste!

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.739
Four hundred and thirty five!

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.739
Mind the Mind!

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.819
We saw the child throw a fit!

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.310
The mind is playing games.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.910
And, we are going to learn a little extra,
about this “mind”.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.310
This is Aristotle.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.980
And, 300 years before Christ, he gave us a
story.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.270
And, you know what his point was?

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.730
“The heart is the seat of the soul.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.690
That’s where a person lives.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.269
All thoughts reside there.

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.050
That is where the soul lives..

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.340
What is the brain for, then?

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.950
When the heart works furiously, it generates
heat..

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.560
The brain is the radiator that serves the
purpose of ‘cooling the heat generated by

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.560
the heart’”.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.280
The brain, the head, was supposed to be the
radiator, it seems!

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.739
How easily and summarily he dismissed the
brain!?

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.239
Not too long ago, just about a hundred and
fifty, two hundred years ago, mankind wasn’t

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.189
too forward in their thoughts about, … (in
their thoughts!) about what’s going on in

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.189
the brain.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.140
A brain.. is encased in a skull..

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.269
A skull like this one.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:53.769
If you want to understand about a person,
why is he murdering so many people…, or

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.810
why is this person such a genius mathematician,
or.. why is this lady singing so well, if

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.040
you want to find answers for those, all you
needed to do was shave their head and feel

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.840
it, it seems.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.920
You could actually have your fingers go all
over the head, look at the cracks where plates

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.570
interlocked into other plates, the bumps,
the curves, using those, one could judge a

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.380
person’s very character, they said!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.160
Less than two hundred years ago, people were
still believing it..

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.870
It was a science at that time.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.050
Now, it is a pseudoscience, not too many people
believe it thankfully.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.020
But, this science was called Phrenology.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:51.150
So, if one were to judge your acquisitiveness,
how you amass wealth, are you a stingy person,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.720
will you be rich in life, will you be financially
fit, … you will probably have to find out

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.310
how bumpy you are in this part of your head.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:13.780
Similarly, conjugal bliss.., marital bliss,
how well will you be.. a performer, in your

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.080
family life, how will women be attracted to
you, .. how will men be attracted to you..

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.990
if we were to want to find that out, guess
where?

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.479
That is where!

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.470
A belief like this!

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.550
About the brain!

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.830
This too, has been proven to be a pseudoscience!

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.020
Not just this..

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.950
There have been further theories.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.660
These theories are the basis on which this
book is written.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.980
It is called The Whole-Brain Child.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.520
Many strategies to nurture your child’s
developing mind.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.419
To develop the complete brain.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.419
There are many parts.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.419
They all work together at the same time.

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.280
There is a lot of push and pull.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.360
The result of that famous push and pull, continuous
push and pull, that is the performance of

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.940
the child in front of you.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.979
And, how do you engage, how do you understand,
how do you react to that, strategies for that.

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.319
Based on pseudoscience, based on myths.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:25.130
Even if that were pseudoscience, why did I
really feel attracted to this book?

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.100
A colleague was reading this book.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.449
And, she showed one particular phrase in that
book, and that hooked me in.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.330
And, that phrase went like this: Are you struggling
for survival, with your kid?

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.520
Unable to shut your eyes even for a moment?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.420
Is it giving you a torrid time?

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.930
Are you even wondering why you even gave birth
to this ‘monster’?!

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.770
Are you STRUGGLING for survival?

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.139
Wait!

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:59.080
These are the moments that you are going to
help the child learn not just how to survive,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.740
but to thrive.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:11.080
“The moments you are just trying to survive
are actually opportunities to help your child

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.539
thrive..!”

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.000
Wow!

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.030
Something interesting, I thought, and I went
into the book, and, boy!

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.720
Was I rewarded!

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.500
Left Brain, Right Brain, we have encountered
this in Quotidians earlier.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.590
People have started debunking this already.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.030
That there is nothing of this sort..

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.340
That the left brain is all about mathematical,
logical, and the right brain is about creative

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.340
visualisation…

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.400
That all this is a bag of hot air.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.690
Let us anyway take a look at that list.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.319
So, what’s Left Brain?

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.960
Yes, you will be analytical.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.919
Yes, you will be numerically oriented.

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:59.170
And, yes, language, words, sentences, will
just flow!

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.170
Left Brain thinking.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.620
And, what about the Right Brain?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.400
Yes, you will be imaginative.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:13.500
You will be able to think of things that never
were, probably never will be, that’s imaginative.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:20.560
Yes, your emotional intelligence, your ability
to be composed, your ability to think big

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:27.990
picture, to see what-if scenarios, your emotional
intelligence will be high, and finally, you

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.900
will be expressive.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.640
Your ability to express them will be very
good!

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640
Left Brain.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640
Right Brain.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.709
They say some people lean towards the Left
Brain, while others lean more towards the

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:40.709
Right.

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:43.820
A myth still exists like that.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.580
A prevalent understanding..

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.930
They debunked this too.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.180
Sorry, there is nothing of this sort.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.440
It involves itself only as a whole brain.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.830
Don’t be misled.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.769
Don’t go for online tests to find out “Are
you 75% left-brained?”..

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:02.500
All that is just hogwash.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.600
Ok, this was Left Right.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.870
There is a Top Bottom too.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.130
Shall we see that now?

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.180
We have seen this one TOO in Quotidians earlier.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.950
Deep inside, in the bottommost layer, is the
Reptilian Brain.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.880
The Reptilian Brain knows only two things.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.240
It will run towards things that it considers
food!

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.470
It will run away from things that consider
it food!

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.470
Fight.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.470
Or Flight.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.430
It cannot have any emotions, any other kind
of higher level thinking.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.430
Reptilian Brain.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.430
Amygdala.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.480
We have read about this earlier.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.650
Over and above this, at a higher level, there
is the Mammalian Brain.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:53.220
This Mammalian Brain has emotions, has feelings,
an expectation of sorts that if it performs

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.820
the same thing again, the same result will
happen..

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.820
Habituation..

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.820
And Memory.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.800
A recall and recognition about something that
happened earlier.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.360
That higher level of understanding or abstraction..

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.750
ability in your brain.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.490
That is the second stage.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.980
Higher floor.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.760
The first floor brain part.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.250
The Mammalian Brain.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.000
And, finally, the Primate or the Human Brain.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.279
That is the outermost layer.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.170
That is the seat of language.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.260
That is the seat of imagination.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.690
That is where your ability to reason.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.829
Your ability to make decisions.

00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:38.800
Your ability to decide between right and wrong,
good and bad, .. These things feature in this

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800
highermost, topmost plane.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.000
They call it the Triune Brain.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.170
But wait.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.860
This is a myth too, it seems.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.310
Nothing of that sort.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:58.360
If a brain starts thinking, the lizard will
start talking, at the same time the human

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360
brain will be talking..

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:06.440
And, ti is a mad mix of all this that manifests
itself as a human behaviour.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.120
People have done a lot of experiments, and
proved this beyond any doubt.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.750
But, it is a beautiful, prevalent myth.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.720
“You are in the fight-or-flight mode.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.149
Think a bit.

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:20.579
Use your mind.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.010
Use your brain.”

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.920
Won’t we say that?

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.779
That’s how they become prevalent myths.

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:30.950
This book is based on such myths as these.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.670
But, sometimes, I feel, these kinds of myths
are useful.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.800
No need to be too literal about it..

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:43.260
As if the Left brain stretches till 180 degrees,
and the right stretches from 180 to 360..

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:50.250
But, if you understand it conceptually, at
an abstract level, then, I think you are good

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.250
to go.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.930
That’s what I did, when I went into this
book.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:12:02.860
And, some very good discoveries, I made.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.270
Before we go in, let me break down one more
myth.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.470
Remember Daniel Kahneman?

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.660
System 1 Thinking.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.959
System 2 Thinking.

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:12.760
Do you remember?

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.500
We encountered it once again in the “Hare
Brain, Tortoise Mind” book.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.949
There are times when you need to instantly
react.

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:23.149
Gut reaction.

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:27.660
And, there are times when you need to NOT
react kneejerk.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:34.779
We learned that you need to wake up, that
lazy, slow-thinking, but rational side of

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:38.130
your mind and that will give you good results.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.730
THAT TOO, indicate there are “Two Parts”
in your brain!

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.959
So, we have seen many parts by now.

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:47.680
And, what does this book say?

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:58.320
Yes, there is System 1, System 2, Left-handed
thinking, Right-handed thinking, a hare, a

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:05.029
tortoise, a lizard, a chimpanzee, and a human
being too.

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.750
All of them.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.480
Inside your brain.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.570
All clamouring for attention.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:18.050
All begging to be allow them to take control
of your mind.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.829
Imagine a lizard ruling your mind.

00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:23.410
Imagine a hare ruling your mind.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.699
“Do not allow that sort of ruling!” — is
the essence of the book.

00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:31.880
That central advice.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:37.360
The book talks about a particular word — we
have encountered it in Mathematics.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.180
The dreaded symbol — Integration!

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.670
What is integration?

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:46.949
Putting various pieces together into a meaningful
hole.

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:48.960
That is the message of this book.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.670
All of these will be in every brain.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.339
Most of them may be myths.

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:56.990
But they are useful myths.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:03.560
And now, put them all together, and use them
at the right time, in the right context, in

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.650
the right manner.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.350
Integrate!

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.160
Have an integrated approach.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.639
Integrate your child’s mind!

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.920
That is the book’s message!

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.459
Here is an example!

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:25.639
The author says, assume this is the River
of Well-Being.

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:32.720
As you float along in that little boat, … it
is a smooth flow.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720
You are in “flow”.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720
(Remember Flow?)

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.449
As you are in flow, you look to the left and
you look to the right.

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:40.779
And there are two banks.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:47.269
By accident, if you swing towards this bank,
this is the Bank of Chaos.

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:48.509
Confusion.

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:49.509
Total irritation.

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:50.509
No form.

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:51.509
No order.

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:52.509
Total mess.

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:58.840
And, by mistake, if you swing towards this
other bank, that’s the Bank of Rigidity.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.510
Everything ordered.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.420
Everything set in stone.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.619
Nothing changeable.

00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:06.899
Everything perfectly laid out.

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:08.259
No flexibility.

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:13.730
The point is, both of these are DANGEROUS!

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.930
Taking the example of the toy boat itself..

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:21.690
, imagine you have a toy boat, and you are
a toddler.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:30.810
And, if you are going to say, “I will not
let any of my friends touch my toyboat collection,

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:36.540
because they will be adjusting it, they will
not put red next to green, which is how I

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.999
want it.. you know, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow,
those four colors?!

00:15:39.999 --> 00:15:43.670
It will always have to be like that.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.270
You are afraid of Chaos.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.980
Is it not?

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.530
On the other hand, assume somebody takes a
boat away.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.160
And you throw up a temper tantrum.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.959
You turn your world upside down, shout at
the top of your voice from the rooftops, .. what

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:05.040
happens there, you are afraid of Rigidity.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:13.430
So, if you are trying to steer away or steer
towards one of the banks, then, that is the

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.430
problem.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:19.779
As long as you stay in the Middle Path, things
are going to be fine.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:25.589
And, the author gives another analogy too,
in the book.

00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:27.410
Emotionless means “Desert”.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.839
He doesn’t laugh.

00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:30.269
He doesn’t cry.

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:32.170
He is never happy.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.990
We are never sure if he is unhappy.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.279
He looks like somebody caught in a permanent
shock.

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:41.279
Emotional Desert.

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:42.279
Dangerous.

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:45.520
You can’t be parched like that.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.630
Nor can you be flooded!

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.750
All the time hysteric, crying.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.920
All the time extra-jubilant.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.800
Sorry, you need that middle path.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.252
And when will you get that middle path?

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.440
When you live an integrated life.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.880
They give some examples.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.459
Here is one.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:11.140
Imagine a scenario where the child says, “I
don’t want to do my homework.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.360
It is late in the night.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.520
I want to watch my TV.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.030
I don’t want to do my homework”.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.390
Don’t Command and Demand.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.690
“No way, you have to do the homework.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.240
I am locking you up in the room.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.459
The remote will be put away, until you finish
it.

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:28.130
Don’t even dream of it.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.370
Don’t even THINK of it.”

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.580
That is Command and Demand.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:38.820
The child is already upset emotionally, and
if you do this Command and Demand, that is

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.240
not going to help.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.100
Instead, the same scenario..

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.160
Look at the change..

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.650
The woman bows down to the child’s level.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.650
Eye to eye.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.240
Already, she has come down from a sense of
authority.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:58.490
After that, the woman is saying, “I know
how you are feeling..”

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.490
Connect!

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.830
“I know how you are feeling..

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.640
I know you want to watch that important football
match.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.409
But, homework is important, is it not?

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:10.710
Let me do this..

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.980
I will stop my TV time too.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.799
I will work with you instead.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.330
Let us record it.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:20.010
Tomorrow, before you leave for school, let
us watch the highlights!”

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.440
So, the child isn’t achieving what the child
wanted.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.930
But, the child has been redirected.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.150
The mother has connected with the child.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.030
So, instead of Command and Demand, Connect
and Redirect!

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.830
Here is another example.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:45.750
A child has scraped her knee, and bruised
it.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.280
It is in a lot of pain.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.040
“I scraped my knee”, the mother hears
this child cry.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040
“Crybaby!

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040
Is this a matter at all??

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040
This is NOTHING.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.630
Everything will be alright.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.990
Just stop it.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.990
Don’t cry.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.710
Crying like a ‘baebee girl’…” shames
the mother.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.049
That is Dismissing.

00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:05.390
“This is nothing.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.530
Is this a pain at all.”

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.090
That is Dismissive.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.250
Don’t do that.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.830
Instead, what do you try?

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.580
Instead, you want to get into the game and
say, “Hey.. I was watching too.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.860
It must have pained a lot.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.679
I am sure..

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:30.750
For, I had a similar kind of fall when I was
a little child like you.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.120
And, ouch.. for two days it throbbed.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.470
Tell me how it happened?

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:42.659
You were turning, and then you slipped, .. and
then I came in, didn’t I?

00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:47.530
I took you in my arms, I hugged you, did it
feel better?”

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.070
Tell the story.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.840
Ask the child to tell the story.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.180
When the child verbalises it.. remember?

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.500
Right brain emotion, Left brain language.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:04.049
From that side to this side, when a connection
is made.., you come to the Middle Path, say

00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:05.049
the authors.

00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:11.360
So, get the child to tell the story, .. or,
tell the story and make the child a heroine

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.580
in the story, and there you get closer to
Integration.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:23.310
We talked about the Lizard Brain and the Human
Brain.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.820
And the two “stratified” layers.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.830
And, the Lizard Brain is “downstairs”.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.220
And, when the Lizard Brain takes over, it
makes the Human Brain nearly inaccessible.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:36.320
It is almost as if a Baby Gate has been employed.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.380
When the Lizard Brain takes over, you think
like a child!

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.240
You are childish in your behaviour.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.809
Because.., when you were born, that very first
day, your Lizard Brain is active!

00:20:46.809 --> 00:20:53.190
You know how to fly, how to run away, how
to fight, how to show fright, you already

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.190
know!

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.740
But, only as you grow older, you start showing,
demonstrating, higher level attitudes.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:06.900
So, when you allow the Lizard Brain to take
over, be it myth or not, when you allow it

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:12.669
take over, you are becoming a child, locked
in the ground floor, unable to go to the higher

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:16.870
floor because there is a baby-gate laid by
the Lizard.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.590
Here is another example!

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.620
The mom is driving.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.640
Going home by car.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.750
The daughter, in the back seat is angry.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.010
Very Angry!

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.150
“I hate you”, she hollers.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.610
The mother doesn’t even turn back to look
at her.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.860
But says, “Don’t ever say that!

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.539
Do you know how many sacrifices I have made
in your life?

00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:38.539
How dare you say that?

00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:42.030
I will drag you up and punish you by pulling
your……”

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.279
Have you heard conversations like that?!

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:47.930
Thank God you haven’t, because you wouldn’t
have been in that car!

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:54.290
But, these conversations continue to happen,
they only Enrage the child even more.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:22:00.640
Because, again, the Lizard is active now,
and if you are going to Enrage the Lizard,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.990
it knows only about Flight and Fight.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.240
Don’t Enrage.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:12.980
Instead, how about the mother says, “I see
you are angry.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.980
I understand.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:20.809
But, is it because I didn’t allow you to
stay longer in the park with your friends?

00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:22.880
We had to go elsewhere.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.779
I had told you already.

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:30.740
Do you understand that you can’t be in two
places at the same time?

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:37.299
Is it okay if I drop you off tomorrow, give
you some extra time?

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:39.820
What do you think?”

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.710
So, instead of Enraging, Engage with the child.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.400
Give them an opportunity to verbalise.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.919
Why are you mad?

00:22:48.919 --> 00:22:50.640
You are saying you hate me.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.480
It is not that you hate me.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:59.240
You are so angry, but the anger coming from
the right side of your brain doesn’t find

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.130
the right words in the left side of your brain
and it comes out as, “I will kill you!”

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.220
No, you don’t intend to kill me.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.539
Try not to Enrage.

00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:10.279
Try to Engage.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:11.559
Here is another example.

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:13.250
I really like this one.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.830
A child brings a frisbee to mom, at the park.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.720
“Mom, I want to take this home”, says
the girl.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.990
Immediately, the mom explodes.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.750
“This is not OURS!

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.000
Put it back where you found it, you idiot!”
says the mother.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
“Sorry, we can’t take this home”.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.690
But, don’t stop there.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.110
Don’t just answer.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.110
Take it to the next level.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.039
What is the next level?

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.039
Exercise the Upstairs.

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.039
What’s upstairs?

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.419
The child is at the Lizard level.

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:47.880
Upstairs is the Human level.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.970
The reasoning brain.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.030
So, talk to the child.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.360
“I understand that you want to keep it.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.870
I understand it looks good.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.380
But, .. whose could this be?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.040
That child may be no older than you!

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.770
What if she returns, looking for it, realising
that she had lost it here?

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.710
How will that child feel?

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.320
Can you tell me about it?”

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.320
When you engage thus, you are asking the child
to Exercise the Upstairs.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:20.039
Because, if you don’t use it, you lose it,
they say.

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:26.090
Once in a while you have to exercise decision-making,
slow-thinking, system-2-thinking.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.789
And, so on and on, the book goes!

00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:33.190
There are TWELVE such pieces of advice.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.149
I am yet to finish that book.

00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:38.980
Hopefully, we will do one more episode, if
you like this one!

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.200
Let’s see!

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.660
But.., as a closing thought, this is what
I perceive.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.160
The word “PARENT”.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.450
What can a parent do, really?

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.470
Can they do this as well as that?

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.550
Yin as well as Yang?

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.710
System 1, System 2, Left, Right, Lizard, Human,
.. how many!!?

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.659
When I was thinking about it, I saw the word..

00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:07.910
And I realised that there was an anagram sitting
there..

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.289
Do you spot it?!

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:12.289
Do you see that?

00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:13.289
R!

00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:18.730
If we add an extra R, you get PARTNER!

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:19.929
R!

00:25:19.929 --> 00:25:21.120
Are!

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.309
Multiple!

00:25:22.309 --> 00:25:23.500
Plural!

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.070
Have somebody alongside!

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:35.260
So, my lesson, from that, is, it is not necessary
for each of you to exercise every one of those

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.920
sides…

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:44.010
If your mother is going to think like a rabbit,
the father is going to have to think like

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.850
the tortoise.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:47.500
System 1, System 2..

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.960
Left, Right.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.159
Creative, Big Picture.

00:25:51.159 --> 00:25:52.620
Logical, Mathematical.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:26:03.000
If you are like that, during every one of
these stages, the child will be an integrated

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
child.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Thank you then!

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.179
I will meet you again on December 10th.

00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:11.100
In fact, on 10th, we have a double-load.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.140
Both 436 and 437 are coming!

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:23.630
Looking forward to seeing 
you soon!

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.500
Namaste!
