00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.020
Alexandria!

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:12.210
Just hearing that name, one would immediately
imagine a burning library.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.759
It is actually a city in the country of Egypt.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.930
But, about fifty years before Christ was born,
… the claim is it had a copy of every important

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.619
document from anywhere in the world!

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.790
Some people say Julius Caesar destroyed it,
some say the Arabs destroyed it, but the belief

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.170
is that it was lost to fire.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.449
A lot of collected knowledge, a veritable
fount of knowledge, was forever lost.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:01:00.410
The library of Alexandria.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:10.210
Namaste!

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.860
Four hundred and thirtyeight is about Alexandria.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.510
They were saying much had been lost to fire,
weren’t they?

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:29.790
While I was researching on this topic, I came
to know that, YES, there WAS a library.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.970
And, YES, the library was burned down.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.170
Accident or Vengeance or Whatever!

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.950
But, NO, there weren’t many books lost forever..

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.579
There weren’t a lot of people regularly
coming and disappointed because of the burning.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:57.060
Like all libraries in the world, this one
too, had suffered because of lack of patronage,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.460
and had already been slowly turning decrepit.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.750
That is the truth.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.250
The bitter truth.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.640
Anyway, I am not here to talk about the Library
of Alexandria.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.940
I am here to talk about Alexa.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.959
Alexa was the name for the Intelligent Voice
Assistant.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:28.620
Amazon, Jeff Bezos the CEO, he wanted to come
up with a device, a series of devices actually,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.370
that we could have an interaction with, as
a customer, a knowledge-customer, with NO

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.780
interface!

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.470
Interface-less computing!

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.730
Just by way of talking!

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.730
“Alexa!”

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.349
And, this series of devices was born.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.540
He decided to call it Alexa.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.200
And why?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.590
He wanted to say, “Here is All the Knowledge
you’ll want.”

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.069
And, where is ALL the Knowledge?

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.569
In the Library of Alexandria!

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.760
So, that’s the reason he named it Alexa.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.510
And, what are we going to do now?

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.410
We are going to put an Alexa in front of us..
not really, otherwise it will start responding

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.690
to me everytime I mention the word “Alexa”!

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.800
But, I am going to ask Alexa, “Give me some
life lessons!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.290
Can you look at your own behaviour, analyse
it?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.980
What can I learn from you?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.500
This impersonal but personalised voice assistant,
what can I learn from you?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.280
As an employee in a company, as a member in
a team, as a manager of a group of people,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.390
what can I learn from you?!”

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.110
Here we go!

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.129
The Number One thing that you can learn from
Alexa is — “Easy to get started!”

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:09.640
Whether you are designing a product, or if
you are interacting with a friend, or, if

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.359
you are in a team, managing a group of people,
make it easier than easy to get started!

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.889
All you have to do is to bring the Alexa device
home, connect to Wifi, and presto!

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.300
You don’t need to learn anything.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:34.820
No Ctrl-C, Cmd-V, X, Esc Key, Enter, Long
Press, Swipe, Nothing!

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.690
You’ve been talking to people!

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.380
Use that to talk to me!

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:50.190
That sense of comfort, if, as a manager, you
can build among your teammates, … “Talk

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.389
to me like you talk to everybody else..

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.050
No need to learn any new protocol!”

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.560
— you have one great gate opened up already!

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.660
Do that!

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.509
The Second Lesson that we can learn from Alexa?

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.790
Always be listening!

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.180
Did you know?

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.180
Controversial topic!

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.300
If you have set up an Alexa device in your
home, be it an Echo or a Show or a Dot, if

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.729
you have set one up, did you know it is alwaaaaaays
listening?

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.630
But, did you also know it is not violating
your privacy?

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.509
It is not collecting all the private conversations
you have at home, sending it to Amazon, and

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.530
analysing it and understanding what kind of
family you are, no no no..!

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.190
It is always listening, because, at any time,
you might say, “Alexa!”

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.940
They call it the WakeWord.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.870
It is listening all the time to check whether
you are waking it up with its magic WakeWord.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.139
You can say it at ANY TIME.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.139
Unblinkingly, sleeplessly, it is listening!

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.750
The moment you SAY that WakeWord, it is all
ears, listening to whatever you say AFTER

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.750
THAT.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.750
Beautiful!

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.650
Not just that..

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.060
As the activities it carries on under the
hood can easily be misconstrued as violation

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.670
of privacy, Amazon now exposes the Voice History.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:32.030
So, you can actually go online and say, “Hey,
show me all the conversations we have had!”

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.110
What can we learn from this, as a teammate?

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.030
As a manager?

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.450
Always be AVAILABLE.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.340
That doesn’t mean “Eavesdrop!”

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:50.140
That means, be ready, be watchful, observant,
for that WakeWord.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:57.259
It could be “Sir” or “Madam” or “Bro”
or “Hello” or “Akka” or whatever.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.259
That WakeWord.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:08.100
The moment they see a need for you, you should
magically just apparate there.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.419
Can you do that?

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:14.850
Also, remember the “Show me my history”
query from the customer?

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.900
Similarly, do you have transparency about
what conversations you’ve had with your

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.900
colleagues?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.170
Can they look it up in some manner?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.979
That is a good lesson to learn from Alexa.

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:35.250
Here is the Third Lesson.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.009
Learn Something!

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.410
In the world of Alexa, whatever you take out
of the box is..

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.410
Echo.. a product.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.600
It is dumb.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.169
It can’t tell more than a couple of basic
things, and look up on the internet.

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:52.860
But, the magic happens when you allow it to
learn skills!

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.860
You can play a game with it.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.180
You can make it count-down from a number.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.889
You can ask it to tell you more about a song
that’s being played right now!

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:06.080
These kind of skills.. and, if you are a developer,
you can add your own skills!

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.660
From Zoho, for example, for some of its products,
we have added some Alexa Skills.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:16.360
So, this kind of learning, .. opens up possibilities.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:24.879
It is not what is in the box, it is not frozen
and fixed, I can update it “over the air”.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.300
The hardware is just the starting.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.260
There is a lot of soft stuff that I can load
on to it, on-call-basis.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.680
That is how we should live our lives too.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.519
It is not “What you see is what you get”!

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:44.250
What you can’t see is what you may get!

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.580
Provided you approach it in the right manner.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.300
With a growth mindset.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.019
With an always-learning attitude.

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:58.550
If you can keep looking around for what you
can pick up, if you can demonstrate to your

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:04.670
team that you are not just a “Get the job
done” person, but you can actually roll

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:10.519
the sleeves up, get dirty, get DOING those
things.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:15.860
That you can lend a hand too when the need
arises, is something that can change the whole

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.429
perspective about how people perceive you!

00:09:19.429 --> 00:09:21.640
You also need to learn THIS from Alexa.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.690
Sometimes, while interacting with Alexa, .. we
would have just asked a simple, “Who is

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.690
this..?”

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.950
To which Alexa, instead of just answering
with a curt “This is so and so”, will

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.769
embark on a whole wikipedia long-form storytelling
initiative about which movie they acted in,

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:38.380
what television show they are appearing on
next, and so on and on and boringly on!

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:44.290
During such times, a bit rudely, I would interject
with a “Alexa, Stop!”

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.230
At half the sentence, midway, it will stop!

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.070
It will not try to have the last word in.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.470
Remember “Last Word Freak”?

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:58.040
When I say “Stop!”, it won’t say “Okay!”
(and get the last word in!), it will JUST

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.040
STOP.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.890
What an important lesson!

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.269
How many among us still haven’t learned
it!

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:08.000
I have a friend, a Whatsapp friend..

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.810
When I say, “Do not type anything further,
I am not in the mood to continue this conversation,

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:23.810
I have said what I had to say, please STOP!”
and their response to that would be a “Thumbs

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.050
up” emoji!

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.490
(Last Word Freak!)

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.740
Learn when to STOP talking.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.250
That’s the lesson I would learn from Alexa.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.899
It can go on and on too.

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:47.880
The moment it senses that I don’t need its
talking now, it immediately stops!

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.829
The next lesson is, “Take It Easy!”

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:54.930
Freeya Vidu!

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.930
You WILL get all sorts of nonsense questions!

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.900
Look at the mischief overload in that face!

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:05.660
Mom and Dad have left him alone, with the
babysitter, and this boy is… having a ball

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.660
with Alexa!

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.980
He wants Alexa to demonstrate a “fart sound”.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:16.060
He wants to know what noise this animal would
make!

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.399
He orders Alexa to “Self Destruct!”

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:23.860
Try that at home and see what happens!

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.020
Funny thing happens!

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.120
You will receive all sorts of junk like this!

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:37.180
If you are in a position of power, if you
are in a pedestal, you will get dung slung

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.639
at you.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:40.850
Mud thrown at you.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.630
Rotten eggs will come at you.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:52.710
Alexa takes those too, welcomingly, uncomplainingly,
with a half-smiling demeanour, a mock tinge

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:59.880
of surprise, and defuses the situation.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:06.000
It will never get angry, it will never speak
fast, it will not stop talking if you want

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.089
it to continue, … If only we can be like
that too!?

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:19.139
Yes, people may wonder if we are given to
emotional outbursts at all, but, sometimes,

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:24.900
in these choppy seas, it is good to be seen
as a lighthouse set on a rocky promontory.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.240
Like the Vivekananda Rock.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.449
In the middle of the sea.

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:29.480
Unchanging.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.510
Unshakeable.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.970
Anytime, you can bank on!

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.970
Reassuring!

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:39.089
How good will that be!

00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:43.190
I came to know about such a mode only when
researching for this Quotidian.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.870
There is a mode called Whisper Mode.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.070
There are a few people in a room.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.700
Some of them are asleep.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.520
But, you want to talk to Alexa.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:01.800
In that case, if you ask Alexa “Who acted
in this movie” or “Who sang this song”

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.570
or “What are my todos tomorrow”, Alexa
shouldn’t of course start rattling off in

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.640
its default voice!

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.910
The others may wake up!

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.950
Interestingly, there is something called a
Whisper mode.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:21.010
If you turn Whisper mode on, … truly beautiful!

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:27.329
If you … whisper… the command, it will
… whisper… the answer!

00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:29.310
How smart!

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.310
How..

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.310
How relevant.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.310
How accommodative.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.630
Oh, you are asking me softly?

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.160
You don’t want others to know?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.410
To be disturbed?

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.150
Try bringing this over to the corporate world?

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:54.120
A person comes to you, confides in you, … “Hey,
I came to know from somebody that..”

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.750
I make that mistake too.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.990
In my team, sometimes, somebody confides,
and I think just removing the name, removing

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:06.700
some identifying information is good enough,
and I try to make a message to the whole team.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.940
You have to be very careful!

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.420
Breach of Trust may result!

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.820
So, learn to activate Whisper Mode too!

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:27.769
Also, one of the most important powers of
Alexa is its ability to network with other

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:28.769
services.

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:30.240
I can find out about the delivery status of
my pizza THROUGH Alexa.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.590
Is the next delivery from Amazon going to
be delayed?

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:38.720
I can come to know about it THROUGH Alexa.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:47.019
Similarly, that is probably the most important
role a manager should play.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.260
Not Work On Something.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.370
Not Get Work Done.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:58.800
But, Set The Ball Rolling, and step away,
and let that performer perform the magic!

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.750
But, in the act of performing that magic,
if there are any obstacles in the way, .. we

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:10.889
have touched upon Vigna Vinayak earlier too
.. removing the obstacles is the key role!

00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:13.670
Be that one point clearinghouse.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.860
Is the Covid lockdown coming up again?

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.110
You take care of it.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.750
Is there going to be no lunch at the office
cafeteria on Sunday afternoon?

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.750
What will your team do then for food?

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.810
You will have to arrange for some food?

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.899
You take care of it.

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:32.900
Some colleague wants an external monitor to
probably maximise her work and get it done,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.299
she needs an approval, You lubricate it for
her!

00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:41.769
This is probably a lesson you can learn from
Alexa.

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:50.670
Be that one point clearinghouse for all the
headache-y mess that surrounds my work so

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.820
that I can focus in my Flow State.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.650
This is our dog.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.870
Karuppan is the name.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.060
Don’t be misled by the skin color.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.180
It is a white dog named Karuppan.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.089
And, we buy Purina.

00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:08.380
A dog-food from Amazon.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:19.430
We had bought it twice, and the third time,
Alexa woke up, and said, “Based on your

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.790
purchase history, it should be time now to
buy dog food!”.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.760
We were taken aback a little, but then we
told ourselves..

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.779
Okay, this is Amazon after all, and Alexa
is from Amazon too, it is good that it is

00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:36.449
reminding me!

00:16:36.449 --> 00:16:47.649
Similarly, think about forecasting, predicting,
based on previous interaction history.

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:52.380
What can you predict about your teammates,
about your employees, about your colleagues,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.730
about your product itself!

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.160
That doesn’t mean all your predictions are
going to come true!

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.800
Nor should you go about merrily predicting
everything you can lay your hands on!

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.679
But, have some alternate plans.

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:14.049
You have a Plan A. Can we have a Plan B based
on this emergency that might happen?

00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:19.280
That should be an important thing that you
should keep running in the background of your

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280
brain.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.360
Just like Alexa.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.110
And, finally, you need to, once in a while,
take Feedback!

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.610
Alexa does it regularly.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.490
“Was I helpful?”

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.610
“Am I talking too much?”

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:40.730
“That information I replied you with, to
your question, did I respond right?

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.730
Do you want to rate me?”

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:47.700
“That thing you bought yesterday, many others
may want to buy it too.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.970
What should i tell them?

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.130
Five Star?

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.299
One Star?”

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.630
It will ask us!

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.870
Similarly, our managers give us a rating,
of course.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.980
But, that 360 rating?

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.940
Where the colleagues, and those under you
tell you how you are doing, … Nothing compares

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:16.530
to the shining candid truthfulness of such
an amazing moment of truth!

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.309
That brings us to the closing thought.

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:20.309
A frightening thought.

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:21.309
This picture?

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.740
It is not a photograph.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.740
Of course, photography wasn’t even around
at that time.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.970
Nor is it a painting.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:31.970
It is from Midjourney.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.530
You must have heard of it.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:40.440
It is an AI platform that can create generative
art.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:50.160
“The Library of Alexandria”, “Burning”,
“The Last Librarian”, “Oil Painting”

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.210
brought this up.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:59.780
Someday we should talk about this generative
thing that’s happening in AI.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.280
The Year of AI, they call 2023!

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.500
We will surely touch upon this!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.570
Thank you!

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:16.379
See you soon!
