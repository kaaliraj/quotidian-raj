00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:08.400
About two days ago, we saw twenty-four laws
from this book. And we compared it with The

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.509
Ramayana. I thought, there are twenty-four
more to go, why not bring in the OTHER great

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:34.030
Indian epic? The Mahabharatha? Shall we give
it a go?&nbsp;

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:45.100
Namaste! Powers of Kṛṣṇā, this time!
Same book. But, the second half, the second

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.260
set of twenty-four laws, we are going to dip
into the stories of Kṛṣṇā, the stories

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.989
from The Mahabharatha! We are going to see
if we can draw some parallels.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:05.189
&nbsp;Law Number 25:- Re-create yourself! Come
up with a new definition! One husband gets

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.720
one wife. One wife gets one husband. Why should
that be the case always?! Draupadi brings

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.619
that angle to the story. Whether it was an
accident, whether it was a purposeful intent,

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.880
we will not know. There are too many stories
for us to identify which one. But, stories

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.320
like "Draupadi asking for an accomplished
husband multiple times, and being given a

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.430
husband five times" and "Draupadi asking for
a husband with five special qualities, and

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.200
being told that all five is not possible in
one person, so, please take five!" exist!&nbsp;

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:47.250
Law Number 26:- Keep your hands clean! No
better way to recollect this particular law

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.189
except to think about this Yadava Prince.
This King. Kṛṣṇā. He is not even a

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:05.579
warrior clan. He didn't pick up a single weapon.
But, look at the devastation he brought about!

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:13.080
He was the mastermind behind The Mahabharatha!
And if you take a look at what he did wreak,&nbsp;…

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.610
that is amazing! He kept his hands clean!&nbsp;
Law Number 27:- Play on people's need to believe

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.020
to create a cult-like following! Ekalavya
had already learned a lot, using Drona as

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.870
his "virtual Guru". But, cruel and selfish
teacher of Arjuna that he was, he took away

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.280
Ekalavya's thumb as Guru Dakshina! But, that
didn't stop Ekalavya from practising his skill!

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.560
He continued at it! He became an amazing warrior..
without using that important thumb finger!

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:55.000
So much so, that even today, there are warrior
clans in tribal India who pay homage to Ekalavya

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.840
by not using the thumb finger. In fact, even
at the Olympics, archers don't use their thumbs!

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.170
What a coup! Don't you think?!
Law Number 28:- Enter action with boldness!

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.590
I am reminded of just one story. I am sure
you are reminded of that same story too. Abhimanyu!

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.300
How he entered that Chakra Vyooha without
ever wondering whether he knew how to come

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.740
out successfully from it. He never did. But,
that is why we probably remember him. He entered

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.480
with boldness!&nbsp;
Law Number 29:- Plan all the way to the end!

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.760
I never knew such a sidestory existed inside
The Mahabharatha all these years, until I

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.180
did some research about this. Did you know?!
Surprising! Ved Vyaasa, the architect of Mahabharatha,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.110
the poet, the writer, an important role-player,
once met the Pandavas and advised them about

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.420
the destined Game of Dice. He is supposed
to have implored them to please lose! "Because,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.970
the universe is waiting! We need you to lose,
so that you can win later" - he is supposed

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.120
to have said! Wow! Planning all the way to
the end! Is it not?!

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.579
Law Number 30:- Make your accomplishments
seem effortless! Lifting mountains is already

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.860
an old trick. Already done and dusted in The
Ramayana itself! The Sanjeevi Mountain was

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.639
lifted by Hanuman with a great leap across
the ocean. That story already exists. We have

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.800
to do something different! He didn't just
lift the Govardhana Giri! He lifted it effortlessly

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.689
with his "Left Hand Little Finger"! How amazing
is that!&nbsp;

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:50.479
Law Number 31:- Control the options. Get others
to play with the cards you deal! You should

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:57.610
be the master of that destiny! There is a
story that goes like this in The Mahabharatha!

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.780
Both Arjuna and Duryodhana head over to ask
for help from Kṛṣṇā. But, Arjuna sits

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.770
at the feet and Duryodhana sits at the head
of the bed. And, because of that, when Kṛṣṇā

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.560
wakes up, the first person he sets eyes on
is Arjuna, and so he offers them this. "I

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:22.389
am unbiased. I follow Dharma. I can give myself
to one Army. And I can give all my.. the rest

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.729
of my soldiers.. of the Narayana Army.. I
can give to the other Army. And, I promise

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.569
not to fight. I won't take up weapons myself".
He looks at Arjuna and adds, "I saw you first.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.570
So, I will give you the option to choose first."
Arjuna immediately, respectfully, says, "Be

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.509
with me, My Lord. That is all I need!". And,
Duryodhana just can't believe his good luck,

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.949
and he runs away with the Kṛṣṇā army!
We know what happens later though but that's

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:57.139
the thing… control the options, and get
others to play with the cards you deal!&nbsp;

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:04.020
Law Number 32:- Play to people's fantasies!
Remember the Kṛṣṇā Leela? That Raasa

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:17.879
Leela? That Maya? Where, to each Gopika, based
on that Gopika's desire and dreams, Kṛṣṇā

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:24.659
appears. Not only did Kṛṣṇā appear
to each Gopika, he did what they wanted him

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:33.960
to do! Not only that! He appeared as if he
was only with that Gopika! What a complete

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.990
fantasy!!
Law Number 33:- Discover each man's thumbscrew!

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.669
Each person has a "breaking point" button.
We just have to locate that button and press

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:56.659
firmly there! A great warrior named Jayathratha.
And, his boon was, whoever beheads him, whoever

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:04.199
causes his head to fall down on earth, will
die, with that person's head exploding! What

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:09.779
does Arjuna do? With great celerity, he releases
an arrow, severs his head, and lifting it

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:21.749
up in the air, drops it on to the lap of his
meditating father! And he drops it, not knowing

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:27.479
what it is… He dies, and Jayathratha dies.
Know each person's thumbscrew!

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:36.419
Law Number 34:- Be royal in your own fashion.
Act like a king to be treated like one! All

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:44.029
the pictures, all the movies, all the TV serials,
all the books that I have read… fail to

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:49.660
acknowledge this little bit. "Hey.. They've
been banished to the jungles for thirteen

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:56.199
years.. And, on top of that, one year of living
incognito. A widow. Five able-bodied males.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:02.759
Two guys who look like twins. A guy who resembles
a living breathing mountain. Another who always

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:09.330
speaks the truth and does the "right thing".
If they go together wherever they go, can't

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:17.220
even a common man identify that these are
the Pandavas and Kunti Devi? So, that's what

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.530
happened. They were royal in their own fashion.
Even if they weren't clad in princely attire,

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:32.419
people knew who they were.&nbsp;
Law Number 35:- Master the art of timing!

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:41.280
Drona is undefeatable. And, they plot against
him. Ashwattama, his son, cannot be killed.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:48.650
But, they kill an elephant called Ashwattama,
and loudly, Bheema declares Ashwattama has

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:54.090
been killed. Drona is not able to believe
it.. Drona looks at Yudhishtra - who never

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:59.550
lies - "Yudhishra? Is Ashwattama dead?
Is this true?" "Well, Ashwattama Hataahataha…

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:06.980
Narova Kunjarovaa"… drags Yudhishtra, meaning,
"I am not sure if it is a human being or an

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:15.320
elephant"… And at that time, at that exact
moment - Kṛṣṇā blows his Paanchajanya,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:23.650
his conchshell and the noise is drowning out
everything, and Drona drops his weapons and

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:31.650
gets into a meditative mode and that's when
he is beheaded. Timing!&nbsp;

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:38.320
Law Number 36:- Disdain things you cannot
have. Ignoring them is the best revenge! There

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:47.440
are so many boons, so many curses, so many
thousand-year-penances, so many Gods appearing,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:57.570
right in front of the eyes, in The Mahabharatha.
They all feature one man performing a penance,

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:07.370
and somebody trying to distract that person.
So, basically, penance itself is a metaphor.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.700
Anyway, you are not going to attain it…
The moment you realise you aren't going to

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:18.520
attain it, you throw it away as sour grapes,
by doing so you get an amazing sense of clarity

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:26.290
in your mind, and that will lead you to something
more than what you thought you could never

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.180
even achieve. Isn't that the essence of all
penance?!

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:42.520
Law Number 37:- Create compelling spectacles!
That magical palace! Draupadi's palace! Where

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:49.230
Duryodhana falters.. He's confused. Is this
marble, is this water, is this a flower? Is

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:58.220
this real? Is this virtual? He is not able
to understand anything! A full book has been

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.350
written on this subject! Called The Palace
of Illusions! Divakaruni's book about Draupadi

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:10.500
is titled "The Palace of Illusions"! It was
a really compelling spectacle!

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:17.680
Law Number 38:- Think as you like but behave
like others! I did think quite a lot about

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.870
this. Where does such a thing feature in The
Mahabharatha..? And, that's when Shikhandi

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:36.360
came to mind. Is he Shikhandi? Is SHE Shikhandi?
Are they Shikhandini? Are they a reincarnation

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:49.380
of Amba? A woman born as a man? A woman becoming
a man just for one night? A woman becoming

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:58.530
a man whenever she wants? A woman with an
unfinished task? She is born a woman. But

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:04.830
she trains as a soldier. She behaves like
a man. I thought that was the closest I could

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:11.630
come.
Law Number 39:- Stir up waters to catch fish!

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:19.260
At the very beginning of the story of The
Mahabharatha, there is a scene where the Earth

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:25.620
Goddess cries and laments to the Gods. Mother
Earth cries! "There is too much bad in this

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:33.260
world. I am bending in the weight. I am not
able to withstand this. Please save me. Relieve

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:39.750
me of this burden." she asks. "No problem,
we will be sending down one of our guys! He

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:47.050
will be featuring a blue skin all over. He
will be the cause of much strife and unrest.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:57.180
A lot of damage to both sides!" What! 116
crore people died, as per a historical reference.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:05.870
Nobody is left behind. Not the Pandavas. Not
the Kauravas. Such is the utter decimation.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:11.490
Mother Earth got what she asked for! She stirred
up the waters!

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:16.760
Law Number 40:- Despise the free lunch! If
something is offered for free, read the fine

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:23.240
print first! That is what they didn't do,
those four Pandavas! In a substory called

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.010
The Yakshaprashna, near the shore of a beautiful
lake, these four Pandavas will see some beautiful

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:34.760
fruits and start eating them. The fifth Pandava
will head over there. He will be told, "These

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:41.960
belong to a Yaksha. These people didn't ask
permission and that is why they are all dead

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:49.630
and lying on the shore." - says the Yaksha.
Yudhishtra replies, "I don't want it. If it

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:57.051
belongs to you, I don't want it. If you have
questions, ask me, I have some answers". He

00:13:57.051 --> 00:14:03.980
is ravenously hungry, but he ignores his hunger.
He doesn't want what belongs to somebody else.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:11.460
He doesn't want a free lunch.
Law Number 41:- Avoid stepping into a great

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:19.630
man's shoes! That is what they did though.
Dhritharashtra, just because he was the eldest,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:31.350
how can he just like that inherit that amazing
antiquated throne…? To sit on the Throne

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:37.910
of the Kuru Dynasty, one needs skill, ability,
capability! They should have seated Vidhura

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:47.540
on it, instead. As the grand wise man..! Instead
of that, they placed a blind man, blinded

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:54.680
to all the corruption that was happening around
him… Great man's shoes… they tried stepping

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.351
in.
Law Number 42:- Strike the shepherd, and the

00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:07.050
sheep will scatter! We know that millions
fought this war. There is mythological data

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:14.130
about this. As well as historical data too.
But, how many names do we really know? Probably

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:21.790
eighteen! Because eighteen chieftains, the
most important ones, they fought. And when

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:30.220
they fell, their armies went home, or died,
left leaderless. So, strike the shepherd,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:37.060
and the sheep will scatter.
Law Number 43:- Work on the hearts and minds

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:44.010
of others! That is what Lord Kṛṣṇā
did. With the Bhagavath Gita. When Arjuna

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:50.820
was dumbstruck.. How can I fight against my
guru? How can I fight against my uncle? These

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.930
are my brothers? How can I do this? At this
wavering moment, Kṛṣṇā intervenes,

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:02.100
asks Arjuna to keep his "heart" aside, asks
him to listen to the advice coming to his

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:09.460
brain, explains what Karma Yoga is, the importance
of Duty, and he delivers the beautiful, beautiful

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:16.230
advice.
Law Number 44:- Disarm and infuriate with

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:25.131
the mirror effect! There are countless weapons.
Small arrows. Asthras. Big arrows. Arrows

00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:31.740
that are never supposed to be used, and so
on. One of them is the Naaraayanaasthra. When

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:41.060
Drona was beheaded, Drona's son, Ashwattama,
who's not dead actually, is so infuriated

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.940
that he takes that special arrow from his
quiver and releases The Naaraayanaasthra.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:56.260
So, what's so special about this weapon? Well,
it will completely utterly destroy anybody

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:02.440
who stands against it. And, Kṛṣṇā knows
about it! And, guess what he does? He saves

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.910
the Pandavas by ordering everybody to prostrate
on the ground. Just surrender yourselves completely.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:18.509
Heart, Mind, Soul, and Body! The Naaraayanaasthra
doesn't know what to do…! Mirror effect!

00:17:18.509 --> 00:17:22.579
It prostrates itself, goes away! Interesting,
eh?!

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:29.899
Law Number 45:- Preach the need for change,
but never reform too much at once! There are

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:35.970
those who claim that The Mahabharatha is the
Fifth Veda. The reason The Mahabharatha was

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:44.039
conceived and written and gifted to mankind?
The Four Vedas were a little too tight. Were

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:49.499
kind of arcane. For common man to understand
the concepts easily, there has to be a story-driven

00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:56.249
narrative, they felt, and that is how The
Mahabharatha was born, say some! When Kṛṣṇā

00:17:56.249 --> 00:18:02.879
laid out The Bhagavath Gita, he made some
modifications, but before that, he understood

00:18:02.879 --> 00:18:10.039
what The Vedas were. He spent time at the
Gurukul of Sage Saandeepani and learned a

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:17.970
lot. He debates with the master. He challenges
the master. And only after all that learning,

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:25.279
he comes up with the essence of The Srimad
Bhagavath Gita. Yes, he preaches, but he doesn't

00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:31.889
reform too much all at once!
Law Number 46:- Never appear too perfect!

00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:36.899
Didn't Kṛṣṇā say he would never brandish
a weapon? But then, did you know there is

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:43.779
a scene like this one in The Mahabharatha?
Arjuna begging Kṛṣṇā to drop the wheel

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:50.590
that Kṛṣṇā is aiming at Bheeshma. You
see, Arjuna has been shooting arrows at Bheeshma

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:56.280
in vain, and Bheeshma is blowing them away
to pieces, and Arjuna is losing again and

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:03.659
again and Kṛṣṇā is infuriated, and
wants to take the matter into his own hands!

00:19:03.659 --> 00:19:12.659
He demonstrates short-temper! For a brief
moment! He is God. Incarnate. But, imperfect!

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:18.450
A bit!
Law Number 47:- Do not go past the mark you

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:24.480
aimed for. In victory, learn when to stop!
There is a crucial moment in The Mahabharatha

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:36.960
where Karna uses a weapon called The Naagaasthra
at Arjuna. He is aiming at Arjuna's heart.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:44.889
And at that time, Shalya, another king, trying
to help Karna, says, "Hey Karna, aim at his

00:19:44.889 --> 00:19:52.379
heart!" "Who are you to advice me, I know
what I am doing.. Do you think I will miss

00:19:52.379 --> 00:20:01.170
my mark?" thinks Karna, and he aims at Arjuna's
head, and Kṛṣṇā (timing again!) presses

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:09.330
the chariot a bit down and it takes Arjuna's
head-dress off, rather than the head itself!

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:15.860
Interesting!
And, finally, Law Number 48:- What a way to

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:24.409
end this long, long tour that we have had!
Assume formlessness! Isn't that the essence

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:30.649
of The Bhagavath Gita and that Vishwaroopa
Darshanam that Arjuna and a few others get?!

00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:38.030
I am everything! I am nothing! I am your brother!
I am your sister! Your uncle! I am fire. I

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:46.950
am rock. I am also nothing. I am the past.
I am the present. I am the future. I am you.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.119
Assuming formlessness.
Anyway, I enjoyed sharing these forty-eight

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:56.889
laws with you. We will come back to these
forty-eight in a modern context in one of

00:20:56.889 --> 00:21:05.080
our future Quotidians. Thank you for now!
Ohhh! Closing thought! By the way, this Mahabharatha?

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.929
Eighteen Parvas. Eighteen large chapters.
The Bhagavath Gita found inside The Mahabharatha?

00:21:10.929 --> 00:21:17.230
Eighteen chapters! How many armies fought?
Eighteen armies! Eighteen very huge armies!

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.960
Seven from The Pandavas side, and eleven from
The Kauravas side. Great! And, how many days

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:28.029
did the war go on for? Mahabharatha war - Eighteen
days! Something about this number eighteen

00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:33.350
and The Mahabharatha! Don't you say?! And,
breaking my head about this number, it suddenly

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:40.450
dawned on me! Wow! Eighteen, seen as a hexadecimal
number, if you convert it to a decimal format,

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:48.899
guess what number you get?! Try it, and you
will be blown away! Let us meet again next

00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:49.769
week! Thank you!
