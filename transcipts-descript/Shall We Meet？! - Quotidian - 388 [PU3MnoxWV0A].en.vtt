00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:10.767
Enakku 20. Unakku 18. This movie came out
way back in 2003 with A.R.Rahman's music! 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:43.267
Do you remember this song?!

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.220
 
These lyrics by Pa.Vijay translate to "Shall we meet?". Okay...

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.470
But, what is so special about July Breeze and Jupiter?! I discovered this.&nbsp;

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.367
I realised that there is something special
about the wind in July. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:13.070
Only on the first of July, does the wind blowing across Chennai, from the West blows the strongest. 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.400
When things are blowing around very very strongly,
"Shall we meet?!"

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.034
Also, we all know - Jupiter's gravity
is the highest among all the planets. 

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:33.010
Its two and a half times the gravity in Earth,
and probably, when the "gravity of the situation"

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.067
is very high, think about meeting! (Not otherwise!)

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:54.034
 

00:01:54.067 --> 00:02:04.034
Namasthe! There was this book I recently bumped into called "Creative Selection". His name is

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:12.620
Ken Kocienda, and he is one of the luckiest,
(or probably the most unlucky, we can't say)

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.580
people who worked directly under Steve
Jobs; people who worked on the cutting edge

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.750
of cutting edge technologies. He was the guy
who actually created some of the things that we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.260
take for granted today.
One of them, is the Keyboard Autocorrect.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.550
It could be on iOS, Android, your laptop,
your tablet, or any device, actually.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.970
But, if you are typing something and it autocorrects,
it is highly likely the concept was born in

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:55.379
this person's hand. He talks about how decisions
were made. He talks about a concept called

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.160
Creative Selection. I am going to come back
to this guy later, we are going to talk about

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:10.209
it in length, but, he also refers to collaboration.
How did they come together? How did they bring

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.379
different thinkers together and do something
amazing? To this question, he

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:24.000
gives an odd kind of answer.&nbsp;
This is the product that they used long before

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.360
the iPhone really became a product. They called
it the Wallaby; and, the Wallaby, a little

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.360
thing in your pouch, your pocket, this wallaby
was connected to a Macintosh and it would

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.180
simulate whatever the eventual iPhone would
show as an independent device.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:52.330
These were the various keyboards he experimented
with. In fact, if this guy's first version

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.850
had come out, we would be using a keyboard
LIKE THIS ONE! Or, a keyboard like this one

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.470
where some keys had three letters on them
and some had two letters on them, and so on!&nbsp;

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.700
But, we all now use this one! Why? And How?! - 
this is what half the book is about! The author has

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.709
done such a good job of the writing that he
has covered a topic like "How did I design a

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.249
keyboard?!" in an immensely interesting manner!
He talks about collaboration, and he says,

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:36.059
"Don't just take it for granted that we collaborated.
We collaborated in a specific way. Exactly 'how'

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:44.999
is important."
"We showed demos to each other. Every major

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:52.330
feature started as a demo. It had to be concrete,
it had to be crisp and specific."

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:03.309
We didn't sit in a room, talking, with whiteboards,
markers, water, snacks, coffee, just talking

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:13.710
into the air. Every one of us did work, and
came together for demos. When a demo happened,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.559
every one had something to show.&nbsp;
It was a really really powerful gut punch!

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:27.300
I was reminded of the Golden Gate Bridge.
I have been there a couple of times.. and

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.580
once, I had the opportunity to take my son
along, and we had this beautiful photo opportunity.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.629
This is the cable! This is how large the cable
is. But, what is more interesting, what is

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:49.629
more relevant to what i am saying now, is…
what is that? That cable? It is composed of

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:56.789
cables! Do you see that? Each is a little
cable, all packed together.&nbsp;

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:07.339
In fact, if you look at the stats, there are
27,572 cables packed into the main cable!&nbsp;

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:12.809
It told me that there is this thing called
Tensile Strength. Instead of using a singular thick

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:20.369
cable, using thousands of thinner cables pointed
in the same direction with the same vision,

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:28.460
makes it much stronger and much longer lasting.&nbsp;
That is what Ken Kocienda says; it wasn't

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.520
one person driving the show, everybody else
following what he said. Each of us had a mission,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.530
had a vision, we worked on it, we came together
very frequently for demo days!

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:51.639
Anyway, whatever the scenario may be, meetings
are bound to happen. People say some senior

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:57.469
managers spend thirty to fifty percent of
their time in meetings - preparing for the meeting,

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:06.499
analysing after meeting and so on!&nbsp;
There are various kinds of meetings. Let us

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:14.349
look at a few!
The first kind of meeting is the classic Dumbledore

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:21.449
addressing everybody in that Grand Hall. He
has a lot of things to say. Nobody is going

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:28.249
to crossquestion him. This meeting is important.
Because it is the inaugural meeting.. It is

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:35.360
a "Hey everybody, listen to me, I have something
to share with you all!". Such meetings will

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:43.039
happen in your company too, and, for those
meetings, are there some titbits of advice available?

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:49.449
Well, all researchers, all advisors, point
to this one thing: Have something circulated

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:55.591
before the meeting starts. What the meeting
is about, what it is going to address, what

00:07:55.591 --> 00:08:01.849
news it is about, there may be people who
will miss the meeting, it will be useful for

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:08.580
them too. The second bit of advice they give?
Have a Q and A at the end. It can even be

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:16.839
in a quiz form! Ask them, did they "get" it?
And finally, just don't allow somebody to

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:26.110
raise a finger from the last bench, and say,
"This can't happen!" These people who shake

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:32.940
the very foundation of things, they are not
allowed in this room! So, these are "Everybody,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.740
just so you know, may this be announced" kinda
meetings!

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:45.190
Okay, there are meetings like this one too!
These meetings could be called Status Update

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:52.400
meetings. We have seen that in Money Heist!
Each is a specialist. Each has been doing

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.649
something very important while the other thought
they had been doing something very important!

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:04.360
In round-robin fashion, each person should
be asked for an update, their update should

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:15.029
be timed! A two- or five-minute timer should
be used! Each person's update, as an email

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:24.050
or a written note, should reach the meeting
convener. And, the meeting convener should

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:29.589
collate everything and distribute it as notes
from the meeting, to everyone, before an hour

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:32.709
goes by after the meeting. This is the Status
Update meeting.

00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:39.810
There is a third kind of meeting. I would
call that the "Collecting Opinions" meeting.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:50.920
"Macchi, Nee sollu"? Remember the Karunas
dialogue in the Pollaadhavan movie? You are

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:59.120
totally stuck. You don't know the answer.
You don't know who knows the answer. You are

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.880
shooting in the dark. Again, you do round
robin. You invite everybody to speak. But,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.990
an important advice that people give here
is, "Some people are doers, they are not speakers.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:18.529
You can't put them on a spotlight and ask
them to come up with an idea on the spot.

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:26.020
They will cut a poor image. They will delay
the proceedings. Such people, please deal

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.050
with them one-to-one, offline, don't invite
them to these meetings. They are more productive

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:41.060
elsewhere". Again, collate the inputs, do
not say "Yes, No, Great, Bad" immediately

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.020
when collecting feedback, because, the next
person may feel bad.. "Oh my God, this guy

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.060
is finding faults even with this good idea..
He is going to lacerate me if he heard mine!"

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.279
Collect, absorb like a sponge, get back to
them individually.

00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:04.681
Finally, we have this extremely vital
deadline. This HAS to be decided! The decision

00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:10.700
HAS to be taken today. The deadline has come,
It is staring upon us! Like in the Baba movie,

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:19.550
"Baba Counting Starts...1. Whoosh. 2. Whoosh.
3. Whoosh..!". There will be times like this

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:26.339
too! Every company, every organization, every
team, goes through such a thing; and, the

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:35.080
advice they give for such a situation is,
"Finish when the TIME is up. Don't finish

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.220
only when the DECISION is made! (Only then,
you have a chance of a good decision being

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.671
taken!)" If somebody opens with "A meeting
is being planned. An important decision is

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:47.220
pending. All of you, please come", the first
question should be, "How long will this meeting

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:54.810
run!" - set the timer. Only then will
a sense of urgency be felt, and you will converge

00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:01.420
to at least a local maxima. That's the advice
from our Baba.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:09.649
&nbsp;As far as I am concerned though, there is
only one little advice I give to all my teammates

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:17.310
who try to convene meetings is this..."Before allowing
people to enter the meeting room, right at

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:26.509
the entrance, have a large jug of water, and
a tall tumbler". I am sure you got the message!

00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:27.939
Thank you!
Meet you next week! Bye bye!
