00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.960
Just think of it for a moment.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.300
Those first faltering steps.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:20.590
That baby, after probably a zillion attempts,
repeatedly trying, and failing..

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.710
Persists..

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.060
And then, that Instagram Moment..

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.850
My baby’s first standup, my baby’s first
steps, walk.. run..

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.320
They say, for the baby to just go face down
itself, is a huge effort!

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.510
What if it had given up at the “crawl stage”?

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.070
How would it even walk or run?

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.980
We encounter failure, but we also win sometimes.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.850
But this baby?

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.199
Until the first win, it has always been a
failure.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:10.150
Isn’t there a beautiful lesson to learn
from that baby?

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.330
Namaste!

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:28.070
Four hundred and fifty nine!

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.409
We have actually seen this topic before..

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.770
Failure..

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.329
And, what can we learn from those failures..

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.329
There are a few things that we haven’t touched
upon.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.280
After all this is such a large subject..

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.479
So, we will look at a few items that we have
missed along the way!

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.219
First up, this is a precept we need to understand
very clearly.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.590
THIS IS WRONG.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.030
What is the process for Success?

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.509
It is NOT “Try and you shall Succeed”.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.329
We need to stop spreading that myth.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.930
Instead, the process in real life, is more
like this.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.120
You Try, and hundred percent of the time,
you Fail.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.350
Because, you are not sure of the right parameters
needed, the right definition of success either.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.020
So, you Fail.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.980
And then, if you have Passion, Guts, Stamina,
and if you probably dynamically reprogram

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:43.659
your Approach, you Try Again, you Fail Again,
and that cycle continues, until, one day,

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.530
you reach what they call Escape Velocity,
and you shoot off, and you reach Success.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.280
So, Success is a long-drawn-out Process.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.410
More like this than like that.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.940
That is the first thing we need to internalise.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.160
If we do that, half the problems of heartburn
that beset us, we will be saved from them.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.120
There is this target..

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.880
To be “On Target”, there is just one right
way!

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.330
But, to be wrong about it?

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:28.220
You could go a bit to the left, a bit to the
right, you could overshoot, you could undershoot..

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.159
you may not probably have calculated for gravity
adjustments, or.. for windspeed perturbance..

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.040
How many different ways!

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.280
How many unique manners in which to screw
things up completely!

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.349
And, of course, simply because there are so
many ways to do things wrong, we can too learn

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.199
so many new lessons too!

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:03.710
When you succeed and win, there is probably
just one lesson to learn.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.739
What is winning.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.340
How to do it.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.980
In that circumstance.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.980
On that day.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:17.810
But, when you screw up, there are a gazillion
number of lessons waiting to be taught..

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:25.671
If you approach with that open “learner
mindset”, failure, temporary failure, is

00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:26.671
probably welcome!

00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:33.220
Did you know that the same TED that hosts
those amazing talks, also publish mini-books

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.220
too?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.620
Some very good TED talks, they convert into
short-form books, and one such book is this

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.620
one.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.870
Called Save Our Science.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.690
(Do you see the hidden SOS there?)

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.900
In this book, the author says, students, children,
should be encouraged to embrace failure.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.940
We shouldn’t fill their minds with the top-level
concern of “Oh my God, I shouldn’t lose,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.430
Oh my God, I shouldn’t make a mistake here”..

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.710
If we grow them up in that cocooned environment,
science will not survive in such an environment.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.670
You need to have miserable failures, things
should blow up, and that is when science progresses.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.720
Experimentation culture will flourish only
then.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.640
“We have another word for it!”, says this
scientist.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640
“Failures?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.430
We call it something else!

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.259
We call it DATA!”

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.139
How beautiful!

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.420
They call Failures, DATA!

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.050
Because, based on that data, they will create
what Success is.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.530
That Data will guide them to the next level
of experimentation.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.630
How beautiful!

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.410
This person you see here, he is Michael Chang.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:57.820
This guy, American, a Chinese American, he
will be like a miniature..

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.760
A pocket replica.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.039
Amazing tennis player.

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.420
He still holds some records I think.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.300
One of them being, “The youngest player
to ever win a Grand Slam”.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.720
I think he is still the holder of that record.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.700
He is not all that talented or gifted, naturally.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.440
Not exceptionally tall, no fast serves, no
great reflexes, nothing of that sort!

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.270
Even today, how many Chinese players do you
know, who play tennis?

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.560
You can count with the fingers of one hand!

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:43.431
Probably, you won’t even be able to start
the count!

00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:45.319
In those days, he possessed just one talent.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.319
Grit.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.319
Fighter.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.550
He used to say, “My coach taught me one
lesson.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.710
Just one lesson, very deeply in my heart.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.810
And, that’s what led me to all the victories.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.380
Do you want to win in tennis?

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.450
That’s no blackmagic there, he used to say.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:08.710
Just ensure you get the ball over the net
one more time than your opponent.”

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:15.169
Sounds a little ridiculous, a bit silly..
but, do you remember “Will it make the boat

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.440
go faster?”

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:24.081
Pretty much along the same lines, the lucid,
simple, distilled, fact of the matter, in

00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:25.759
a game of tennis..

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.660
“Once more over the net than you!

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.810
You placing it to my left?

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.810
Take this.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.879
You passing me on the right?

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.840
How about this!

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.880
I would tire my opponent out.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.880
Once more.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.900
Once more.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.970
Make that guy make a mistake.”

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.270
That was grit.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.970
And, the moment I consider the concept of
grit, this is the book that comes to mind.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.879
Angela Duckworth is the author.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:56.490
She has researched what it means to be an
underdog.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:02.440
She talks about how her father used to dismiss
her away as “You are not genius material.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.540
Why were you even born”.. etc.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.470
That lady, she has climbed the ladder.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:15.410
She has become a researcher, in fact, jokingly
she remarks that she is now a genius researcher.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:21.630
“My father isn’t around today, but if
he were around, I would like to tell him that!”

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:30.449
So, this lady, she comes up with a pseudo-mathematical
proof of what it means to achieve something.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:36.039
I call it pseudo-mathematical because.. it
isn’t really rigorous mathematics, but addition,

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.820
subtraction, multiplication, these are popular
concepts that we have encountered often in

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.500
basic maths.. and, she uses those to teach
us, in a way that everybody can understand,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.090
two important formulae.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.090
She says, “There is Talent.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.790
And, there is Achievement”.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.670
What you are innately ABLE to do.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.149
And, WHERE that has taken you.

00:08:55.149 --> 00:09:03.279
If Achievement is to be reached through Talent,
first up, we need to derive something called

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.930
Skill, from Talent.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.240
And, how do you do that?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.779
Talent multiplied by Effort, is Skill.

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:15.480
Not enough if you have an innate Talent for
something.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.183
You need to put in the Effort, to convert
it into a Skill.

00:09:17.183 --> 00:09:23.890
When you put the effort, it will express itself
as a Skill.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.140
Talent multiplied by Effort, is Skill.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.500
Nice, simple, pseudo-mathematical formula.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:42.300
And then, she says, for Skill to become an
Achievement, .. you CAN do something, you

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.519
have a Skill.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.670
You have developed it.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.600
And, using that, if you want to REACH somewhere,
how to Achieve..?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.950
For that too, there is Effort needed.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.850
So, simple mathematics..

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.829
Surely, you would have encountered this at
school.

00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:00.730
What does this mean?

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:08.860
Talent multiplied by Effort-Squared, is Achievement.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.160
What does that mean?

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.010
If you want to Achieve something, you surely
need Talent.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.410
A random person cannot walk in and Achieve
something.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.410
Agreed!

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:27.240
But, whatever importance we give Talent, we
need to dedicate MANY TIMES MORE IMPORTANCE

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
to Effort.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.240
Exponentially more.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.120
You need to give importance to Effort.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.390
That is Grit.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:42.980
Even after facing difficulties, even after
staring at defeat, even then, to grit your

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.440
teeth, and grind through..

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.200
“I will cross past the finish line, even
if it means I have to crawl..!”

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200
That is Grit.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:58.829
And, that is what converts Talent and Skill
into Achievement.

00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:04.410
We have ALL gone through this phase.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:11.420
Little Boy or Little Girl, Uncle Aunt Mom
or Dad behind us, guiding us, to ride a bicycle.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.649
They all would have given us this advice,
surely.

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:16.880
“Hey, please remember.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:23.690
We have always advised you to do things slow
and steady, not to hurry things, not to go

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.060
fast.. all this while.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:32.250
But, for the first time I am telling you,
don’t go too slow..!

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.889
If you don’t go fast enough, you will not
be able to learn!”

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:40.170
And, how did we understand this pithy advice?!

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:46.720
“Oh, if we go slower than a threshold, the
cycle will buckle and fall..

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.300
We won’t have enough forward momentum..”

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.780
That is how we explained it to ourselves.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.880
Yes, that’s true too.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.350
But, there is another bit of advice hidden
there..

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:07.720
If you don’t go fast enough, if you don’t
push the limits of your environment, again,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.350
you will not be able to learn.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.650
So, don’t go slow..!

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:24.140
And, please don’t settle into a normal comfortable
speed either..!”

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.180
Continuing that analogy of the cycle, I am
sure you remember the Goldilocks Zone we have

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.180
talked about earlier.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.180
What is that Goldilocks Zone?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.480
Getting out of the comfort zone into the learning
zone..

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.690
This is a comfort zone..

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.690
A tricycle!

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.160
You can’t have a fall, with it.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.160
Too easy.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.950
You will be bored trying this.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.750
This on the other hand is the panic zone.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.750
The unicycle.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.750
It is too hard.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.750
I tried.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.230
We have one at our office.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:58.079
It is next to impossible to balance yourself.

00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:03.410
You will panic, you will start hating the
art of riding itself.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:10.720
So, between too easy and too hard, that’s
the Goldilocks Zone, and that is the cycle

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.040
we are all comfortable with.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.670
This sounds theoretically right, conceptually
appropriate, we have seen this in earlier

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.730
Quotidians too.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.920
Many books have talked about this.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.690
But, recently, there was a research.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.100
After all, there is much noise these days
about machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:37.910
There was research done on a set of algorithms
and how they learn to identify brain tumour,

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.350
given a scan.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:48.240
If we give it a scanned image, can the algorithm
find out if this is a normal brain or a tumoured

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.240
brain..

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.089
They are training it with existing data.

00:13:53.089 --> 00:14:00.070
If we give it 100% good data, how does it
learn?

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:08.740
If we give it 50% data good data, how does
it learn?

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:17.240
And then, they found out only when the 85–15
principle is adhered to, that is, “Give

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:29.390
it data such that, 85% of the time, it guesses
correctly, and 15% of the time, it makes a

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:38.269
silly mistake, and you intervene to correct
that anomaly.. to educate that model and say,

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:43.260
“Hey, you have made a mistake here, you
need to correct it by doing this”..

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.840
That advice should happen 15% of the time.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:53.740
That is when it morphs into the best learning
environment, ever.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:15:00.270
Many research efforts were put into evaluating
a lot of machine-learning algorithms.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.089
And, the scientists who worked on this say,
this is not true just with the machines..

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:08.089
it is true for human learning too.

00:15:08.089 --> 00:15:12.440
If you are in a classroom, and if you have
been given a math problem to solve, or if

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:22.680
you have been challenged with a Lego set to
construct, too hard, too easy, not good learning

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.680
environments.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.639
But, if it has been set up such that 85 percent
of the time it yields a win, and 15 percent

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:40.190
of the time we face a loss, then, true learning,
persistent learning happens.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:48.000
So, losing is an important aspect in the game
of life.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.100
If you consider the game of chess, you can’t
even hope to win without losing something

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.100
in the process.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:02.050
You need to protect your King, you need to
attack the King of the opponent, .. just to

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.970
make way, you may have to sacrifice some of
your own pieces.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:15.660
If you are going to be adamant about not losing
a single piece, you may never be able to win!

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.870
What can we learn from failure?

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.199
I have three lessons to share..

00:16:20.199 --> 00:16:24.410
Lesson Number One, we learn about Emotions.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.920
Victory is just one emotion.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920
Joy.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.470
Unadulterated, unbridled Joy.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:38.680
But, when you lose, you are Angry, you are
Disgusted, you are Sad, you are Angry.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.970
How many Emotions!!

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.310
And, Emotional Intelligence is the need of
the hour!

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:49.250
To understand what you are going through,
to have an out-of-body experience to look

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:55.370
at yourself and do an evaluation of what you
are burning through..

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.750
It is a rare ability that so many of us today
miss.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:05.610
If you want to practise that skill, you need
to face defeat and failure.

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.470
Here is another Lesson that we can learn only
by Losing.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.270
You all remember the story of Ravana.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.660
He had performed the most torturous of penances..

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.160
See this picture for example.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.250
You see only nine heads up there..

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.740
The tenth one, he has severed, converted it
into the sound box of his Veena!

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.289
And he is singing the praise of the Lord.

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:24.289
To Lord Shiva.

00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:27.230
And, he received some amazing boons too.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.230
The boons he got protected him from Defeat.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:35.990
He requests that he not be killed or defeated
by the Devas, the Kinnaras, the Gandharvas,

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.590
.. a whole long list.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.980
But, he misses mentioning Humans!

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.670
And, that is because he doesn’t even consider
humans a credible threat.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:52.130
And, that is what led to the Rama Avatar..
who came in as a human being.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:58.670
A simple, normal, two-legged human being,
and defeats Ravana.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:04.490
To get that all-important quality of Humility,
Victory and Success alone won’t be enough.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:14.570
Only when you lose, you learn it is the form
of the day, it is the scope of the playing

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.330
field, that decides who is the winner.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.520
And then, there is the third lesson.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.930
The third lesson is, .. something that I have
often alluded to..

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.060
It is all about the Journey.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.770
Not the Destination.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.260
In this playground, we play nearly daily.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.740
We play basketball.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:47.110
And, when we form teams, .. I secretly (don’t
tell!) form the teams so that the other team

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.809
will have an easier game.

00:18:48.809 --> 00:18:49.809
Why?

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:58.929
Well, you remember that adage — “Sometimes
I win, other times I learn!”.

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:03.600
You both play that one hour game.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.380
Both the teams go through that process.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:13.380
It is like when you are headed to the Sabari
Mala, on a pilgrimage.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.180
It is a long arduous journey.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.409
It is a marathon effort.

00:19:17.409 --> 00:19:19.090
Winning, here, seems as ridiculous as exclaiming,
“Aha!

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.140
We both started days ago.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.919
But, I am the first to reach the holy steps
of the temple!”

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:25.919
Go ahead!

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:26.919
Be my guest!

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:30.470
I enjoyed the passage, just like you did!

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.030
I saw the sights just like you did.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:38.950
I prayed at every one of those little temples
along the way, just like you did.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.000
What’s the big deal?!

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.660
We both have experienced and gained from that
journey.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.580
That is the third lesson that Failure teaches
me.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.140
Focus on the Journey.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.630
Focus on the Exposure that you are getting.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:07.000
As a Closing Thought then, at school, and
at college, many many people pay much money

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.429
as fees..

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:10.429
Many of us succeed.

00:20:10.429 --> 00:20:12.720
Some of us succeed very well.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.549
A few of us fall down the wayside.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.179
And we fail..

00:20:19.179 --> 00:20:23.450
And, this is what we think happens.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.450
NO!

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.890
Turn it around.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.010
Everyone of us succeeds.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:35.450
Whoever sees failures as the stepping stones.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:49.630
To put it simply, Failures, they are the FEES
you pay 

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.700
to Succeed.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:59.600
Only when you Fail, you know what it is to
Win.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.289
Remember that!

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:04.679
And, all the best for your future Failures.

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:08.679
We will meet soon.

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:18.510
Thank you!
