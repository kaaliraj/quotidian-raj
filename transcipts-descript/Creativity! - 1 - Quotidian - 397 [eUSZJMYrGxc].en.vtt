00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.070
Enthusiasm!

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.290
Simple word, right?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:15.291
But, if you break it up and take a deeper
look, you realise that there is “en” and

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:17.550
there is “theos”.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.900
That is God!

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.990
And, “en theos” is “divinely inspired”
— as if possessed by a God!

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.710
Be in ecstasy!

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.710
Enthusiasm!

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.000
That’s how this word was born!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.720
Such a common, simple, frequently encountered
word, but its beginning..?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.250
It starts with a concept where they involve
something DIVINE!

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.690
Something divine that enters your body, possesses
your soul, and brings forth a feeling, an

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.079
emotion, a quality!

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.040
There is another word like this!

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
Surprising!

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
Common!

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.770
But, involving something divine!

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:23.979
We are going to look at that word TOO, in
today’s Quotidian!

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:24.979
Namaste!

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:25.979
Creativity!

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.010
There are hundreds of definitions for this
word!

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.939
And, I looked around at a few interesting
candidates too.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.880
One that was truly poignant, even scientific,
something that was truly catch-all in its

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.439
perspective, was this one.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.070
This is how it goes:- Creativity is the ability
to transcend traditional ways of thinking

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.909
or acting, and to develop new and original
ideas, methods or objects.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.320
Let me underline a few phrases.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.320
Transcend traditional…

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:10.140
Going off the beaten path, not the one everybody
knows, everybody is used to, … Also, it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.280
is to develop..

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.010
Not to talk about, propose, say…

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.230
And, to develop what?

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.250
An idea.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.250
A method.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.250
An object.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.250
Even a process.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.930
It looked to me like this definition captured
all that Creativity was about.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.800
Creativity — this word itself is a pretty
recent one, I came to know.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.790
We have seen this N-Gram viewer from Google.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.170
How popular a word is…

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.230
When did it come into circulation…

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.569
When did it become a really trending word…

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.129
We have used this N-gram viewer earlier too,
in Quotidians.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:59.620
If you look at the word “Creativity”,
nobody has used it till about 1900.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.340
Just for the past 100 years or so, it has
actually peaked.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.820
Before that?

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.170
What were they saying it was?

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.090
Whenever something creative happened?

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.580
For example, when Newton discovered that there
was a Law of Gravity…

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.500
They used the word “inspired”…

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:34.920
If Beethoven gifted an amazing piece of music
to the world, they called it “inspirational”.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.019
And, this word, “inspiration”, if you
look into its etymology, “in” and “spirare”..

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.300
God’s own breath..

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.349
Drawn into your lungs.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.040
As if the breath of God has helped you by
getting inside you..

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.450
That is the root of the term “I feel inspired”!

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.849
Like respiration and perspiration, inspiration
is about drawing a breath!

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.200
Only in the past hundred years, we keep encountering
the term “Creativity”.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.040
Isn’t that interesting?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.170
In Quotidian — 033, more than a year ago,
we talked about distracted minds.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.469
And, specifically, in that episode, we came
to know that to learn about how to avoid distractions,

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:25.759
you had to learn about the various networks
in the brain are.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.870
And, we encountered three networks.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.529
I am sure at least some of you remember those
three.

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.080
One is the Executive Attention network.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.770
That is the thing that makes you turn towards
the noise that you suddenly hear in the middle

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.389
of the night.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.300
React immediately when something comes at
you.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.849
Something hot touches you.

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:58.969
Because it is constantly waiting for stimuli
that could be potentially dangerous.

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.219
The second network is the Imagination network.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.189
This wakes up only when the Executive Attention
network is “at rest”.

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:20.249
But, when the Imagination network wakes up,
it dreams, it imagines, it thinks, it asks

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.000
the question “Why not” and “Why”.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.559
That is the Imagination network.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:31.919
And then, there is the third network, which
is very important, and that is called the

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.389
Salience network.

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:41.770
The Salience network was introduced in the
other Quotidian as the network that forms

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.620
interesting connections between the Executive
and the Imagination networks.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.710
But, I read a little more about it.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.139
Got a little more clarity.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:04.770
And, learned that these three networks need
to resonate if Creativity is to take root.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.919
If these work together, like an orchestra,
Creativity will grow.

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.419
For example, try this one on.

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:12.669
A dark night.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.580
You are on a dimly lit road.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.470
You see something on the ground.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.399
Bent.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.399
Dark grey.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:23.399
Bent.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.559
You wonder for a moment, is this a snake?

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:34.520
And then, immediately you chide yourself,
and realise that it is a harmless piece of

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.680
rope.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.410
So, that is the Executive Attention network
jumping to save you, and then, and then, going

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.509
back and saying, Sorry-Sorry, I disturbed
you.

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:51.490
And then, there is this Imagination network
that looks at the same rope.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.729
And then starts dreaming about it.

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:56.830
What if it were a snake?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.800
What if the tail and the head came together?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.039
What if a snake could eat its own tail?

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.770
Ouroboros.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:20.279
Egyptian God of the beginning and 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.279
the end.

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.340
Spinning a yarn!

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.340
Daydreaming!

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.340
Why?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.919
The Imagination network has taken over, the
Executive Attention network has gone to sleep.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:33.740
But, this is not enough.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:41.740
True Creativity will come only when the Salience
network also wakes up at the right moment.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.459
You saw a rope.

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:46.039
You were reminded of a snake.

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:49.050
You saw a snake in your mind.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.139
You started thinking about it.

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:54.050
You went all the way till Ouroboros.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:08:02.529
But, that is when you start thinking, hey…
what does this resemble?

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:04.870
What else looks like this?

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.110
Carbon..

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.830
Four bonds needed.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.069
Hydrogen.

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:16.029
One bond should do.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:17.029
Benzene..

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:20.020
A chemical compound..

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.800
We are looking for its structure.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.729
What shape.

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:28.729
What structure.

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:34.099
We haven’t been able to propose a stable
structure for it yet.

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.759
A snake that bites its own tail…

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:39.029
That is what Kekule thought about!

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:40.800
Some say he dreamt of it.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.289
Some say he thought about it.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:50.589
But, anyway, he saw a connection between the
Knowledge he had, Carbon needs four, Hydrogen

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:56.129
needs one, combining this Knowledge with the
Imagination of the snake eating its own tail,

00:08:56.129 --> 00:09:02.370
that is what yielded the solution that everybody
called Creative..

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:10.160
And the most famous chemical structure of
Benzene was discovered.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:16.399
The three networks have to be in symphonic
orchestration with each other.

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.660
NASA — we all know about this organisation.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:24.730
We have read and heard a lot about the amazing
number of genius scientists who work there!

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:35.339
When America and Russia were caught in the
Space Race, back in the 60s, NASA wanted to

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:44.221
get some of the best brains and they engaged
George Land, a scientist.

00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:49.170
And, he formulated a “Creativity Test”
and got the best and the most creative engineers

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.740
to work at NASA.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:58.120
But, instead of stopping there, NASA management
approached him to find out if this can be

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.399
spotted at a very young age…

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:05.230
Can I try to find out who will become creative
geniuses when they grow into adults?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.360
Can we administer a similar test to children?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:18.680
The professor was up to the challenge and
he devised a test that was applicable to children

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.779
too.

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:24.990
And he started administering the test to hundreds
of children.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.439
These were the results.

00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:34.029
When given to five-year-olds, 98 percent passed
the test, and called themselves geniuses!

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:43.899
But, when the same test was given to the same
children a few years later, only 30% passed.

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:46.209
Do you see a trend?

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:49.649
A few more years later, only 12% passed.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:56.800
And, finally, when they had become real adults,
twenty-plus years of age, only 2% passed.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:04.600
It is almost as if we are being told, “What
do we learn at school?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.939
What does academics teach us?

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:09.189
Non-creative behaviour!”

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:19.449
That seemed to be the final conclusion.

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:24.050
This creativity test that he had devised?

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.449
It was all about Divergent Activity.

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:29.360
There is a problem…

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.319
How else can this problem take shape and diverge
into?

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:41.769
That sort of thinking is what I expect in
creative people, said George Land.

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:42.769
What is that, really then?

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:49.420
That divergent thing is nothing but the brain
of the child having a lot more connections..

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.730
The child connects everything with everything
else.. because, when it is a child, everything

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.660
is new to it.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:03.019
But, as we grow older, something called synaptic
pruning happens…

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:14.019
This pruning is basically the removal of unnecessary,
unneeded, infrequently used pathways and connections.

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:19.459
Even Picasso has quipped:- Every child is
an artist.

00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:28.149
The adult we call an artist then, is just
a child who hasn’t forgotten how to draw.

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:38.009
So, this pruning is good, but, when you are
talking about creativity, if you can manually,

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:45.139
artificially, try to look at it divergently,
that is a good indicator of your creativity.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:49.480
There is this family of tasks called Divergent
Association Tasks.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.980
There are many online tests.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.519
If you want to test your creativity, there
are actually dozens of tests, readymade, for

00:12:58.519 --> 00:12:59.519
it.

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.879
For example, given a pen, how many different
uses can you think of?

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:01.879
Well, I can use it to write.

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:04.050
I can use it (disrespectfully) to throw it
at my teacher.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.470
I can send it (unsafely!)

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.470
into my ear!

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.879
And so on, you can come up with ten different
uses.

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:15.810
This Divergent Association Task — I have
a URL for you.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.290
You can visit https://bit.ly/tenword — and
take that test yourself.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:26.500
This test, a beautiful test, you can finish
it in just four minutes.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.870
It is about giving ten words.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.959
Ten words that are as different from each
other as possible.

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:40.290
If you mention “cat” and then follow it
up with “dog”, sorry, too close!

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:45.889
If you mentioned “cat” and mentioned “green”
next, you would think they aren’t close,

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:48.149
but sorry, cat’s eyes, green!

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:52.790
But, if you say “cat” and follow it up
with “submarine”, probably, they are far

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.790
away from each other.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:59.850
This is exactly what the test tries to find
out using an algorithm, gives a map, and a

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.670
score for you!

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:08.329
Go ahead and find out how creative you are
using this Divergent Association Test!

00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:11.350
Let’s meet soon!

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.100
Oh well, when I say “Let’s meet soon”,
I need to add a closing thought!

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.050
But, today we can’t have a Closing Thought!

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.560
It is the 4th of June today!

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.540
The second part has to be done today too!

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.519
So, we will meet in a short while.

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.749
Let us have this as an Interval Thought!

00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:32.850
When we meet next, we are going to talk about
the Hare and the Tortoise, and how they are

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.689
connected to today’s word — Creativity!

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:38.089
Thank you!
