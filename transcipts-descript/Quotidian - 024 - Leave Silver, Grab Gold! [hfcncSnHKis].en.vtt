00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.939
Namaste!

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:12.180
The Crystal Maze was a fun TV program. A fun
adventurous TV program. In that, half a dozen

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.060
people will be led through many adventurous
mazes where they will earn crystals, and using

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:27.550
those crystals they have to collect some tickets.
Watch this!

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:37.310
They have five crystals, here. That means
twenty-five seconds inside the Crystal Dome.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.890
You have to collect the gold tokens — which
will be added to the total. And you should

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.879
NOT collect the silver tokens — which will
be DEDUCTED from the total! The powerful fan

00:00:46.879 --> 00:01:06.320
blows everything up into the air. As the time
counts down, they have to collect it all in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.540
a hurry… Very famous, very popular game,
called The Crystal Maze!

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.230
So, gold will give you PLUS points, and silver,
they will deduct. Up in the air, like pieces

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.920
of paper. You have to collect them… What
will be your strategy?! How will you approach

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
this?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:40.030
Think about it! Silver minus. Gold plus. This
is where we face the dilemma between efficiency

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.940
and effectiveness. The tussle that happens.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.700
What is efficiency? Finetuning the “how
will we do it” to the best possible approach.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.430
What is effectiveness? What is our end goal?
What are we trying to achieve? Wondering and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.100
thinking about that deeply. Have we identified
that end goal properly? Deliberating on this

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490
topic is what effectiveness is all about.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.060
Which is why… they keep talking about the
crucial difference between doing things right

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.020
versus doing the right things! A robot, for
example, will do it very correctly! But, a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.250
human being? The assumption is the human has
the ability to discern whether they are doing

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.280
the right thing in the first place. Efficiency
versus Effectiveness.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.569
Take a look at this cartoon. Even if the tortoise
is going slowly, it is going in the correct

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.400
direction! But the hare… even though he
has a motor boat that will travel a hundred

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.220
times faster, what is the use traveling in
the opposite direction?!

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.983
There is this book called The Day of the Jackal.
One of the best books, even today, that describes

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:54.830
the “anatomy” of a long-distance shooter,
a sniper. The story. The plot. Described so

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.510
beautifully. Two seconds. Just two seconds.
From the gun to the body of the person the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.060
bullet has planned to assassinate… It takes
just two seconds. Two to three seconds. Throughout

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.980
the book, though, the whole discussion is
about the last gunshot in the last page of

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:22.290
the book. But… the buildup… What are the
things that go into the barrel of the gun…

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.900
What are the things he does to aim and train…
He takes into account the velocity of the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.870
wind, he checks the lubrication, he makes
a small notch in the nose of the bullet, a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.550
thousand little things… that go into the
planning. That is what makes it EFFECTIVE.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:50.520
There is this book by Stephen Covey. Titled
“The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People”

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.950
(Not highly efficient people!) The seventh
habit in that book? Sharpen the saw! It must

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.750
have probably evolved from this original quotation
from Abraham Lincoln. If you’ve been given

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.201
just six hours to chop down a tree, then,
I would spend a full four hours just in sharpening

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:16.489
the axe, he is supposed to have said! Why?
If I have a sharp enough axe, I can chop off

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.740
a tree in a matter of minutes. That is the
kind of confidence the person gets. Again,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.530
effectiveness is more important than efficiency.
What you choose to do is probably more important

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.849
than how you end up doing it.

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:44.069
And so, if a little girl, perhaps your daughter,
perhaps your sister, perhaps somebody who

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.240
is working with you in your team, whoever
she may be, if she is at a window, idly staring

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.310
away into the faraway nothingness, don’t
jump to a conclusion there, right there…

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.289
Don’t say, “You are wasting your time”.
She could be J K Rowling. Thinking about her

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:09.029
next amazing Harry Potter story. She could
be Kalpana Chawla. Dreaming about the stars.

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:18.319
How do I fly to the neighbouring planet! She
could be that! So, she could be sharpening

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:25.330
her saw! That is why, we saw a while ago,
about “metrics”. What are you going to

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.490
measure? That is a very important question
to get an answer for. No point measuring how

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.860
long you’ve been staring at a computer,
typing at the keyboard, if you haven’t been

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.479
sharpening your saw! Thank you!
