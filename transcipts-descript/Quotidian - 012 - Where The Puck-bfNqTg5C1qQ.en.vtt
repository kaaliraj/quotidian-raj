00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.290
Namaste!

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:11.790
Many many years ago, at the junction point
between South America and North America, in

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.170
a country named Honduras, there used to be
this incessant problem of heavy rains, hurricanes,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.869
and floods.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.220
Really ridden with hurricanes all the time.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.410
A particular place in that country — named
Choluteca…

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.680
So, they wanted to build a bridge so traffic
an move very easily over the River Choluteca.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.060
So, they sent out tenders, and a company from
Japan got the order, and we know about Japanese

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.060
quality…!

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.140
They executed it exceptionally well!

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.480
And they worked on it for three years, it
was an architectural marvel…

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.640
A beautiful masterpiece!

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.870
But, like I told you, this was a place frequented
by hurricanes.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.110
And it so happened that just three months
after the completion of the beautiful bridge,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.450
Hurricane Mitch decided to pay a visit.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.100
It killed thousands of people..

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.080
Eleven thousand people lost their lives around
the country, and it blew full force on the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.680
bridge over the river Choluteca.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.630
But, this is Japanese architecture, high quality,
and so, what happened?

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.690
The bridge won the war, against the hurricane!

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.020
It stood unmoving, unmoved.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.690
But… wait.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.300
Two unexpected things happened too.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.320
The road that led to the bridge, and the road
that led off the bridge… were swept away

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.390
in the floods that ensued.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.700
So, the bridge is standing, all by itself,
alone and defiant.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.260
The road that comes in is missing.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.760
The road that leads off is missing.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.850
And, even worse, the hurricane was so powerful,
it changed the course of the river.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.490
It changed the path the river was flowing
in!

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.029
So, a bridge that looked like this, so beautiful
and amazing, became like this.

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:18.860
The bridge is standing all by itself, and
the river is flowing, somewhere else, nearby.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.579
Sometimes, in fact, too many times, this is
how we prepare for life.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:34.090
We learn some skill, we pick up some degree,
we think some domain is going to be really

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.349
hot and enter it, but before we finish studying
it and before we graduate, the world has changed.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.249
What is hot now is not hot when you are coming
out.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:51.870
Instead of preparing ourselves for the future,
we just seem to hop on to the current trend,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.550
and try riding the horse.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.189
As if wanting to make hay while the sun shines.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:07.189
So, you have to be very careful how you pick
what you want to spend your time on.

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.950
In fact, take my own case.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.069
For the past two weeks, intent on spreading
news about my videos on Whatsapp, I created

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.349
lists, learned how to create broadcast lists,
learned much about automation, sent off messages

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:30.579
at seven in the morning on the dot, I did
all that.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:31.819
What happened?

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.060
The Bridge of Choluteca was left useless.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.060
Why?

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.730
Whatsapp had its privacy horror moment.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.010
One person says jump to Telegram.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.540
Another says get Signal.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.349
A guy even says there is this thing called
Arattai.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.430
That’s what happened.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.709
I had to relearn everything!

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.510
So, we have to be careful what we pick to
spend our time on.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.250
Because, … this is what we think.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.849
In college, in school, we think, okay, they
are giving us keys.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.549
With these keys I can open all the locks that
we will want, we will face… is what we think.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.019
But, these are the keys we are given, but
somebody comes along and changes the locks…!

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.230
When you are going to be seeing new kinds
of locks, old keys… there’s not even a

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.230
keyhole these days!

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.160
It is all thumbprint driven!

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.880
It is cellphone enabled!

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.170
What are you going to do?

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.370
So, is it important to collect a lot of keys?

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.280
Or… is it more important to learn Keymaking?

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.110
That should be your thought.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.020
In fact, Steve Jobs, quite frequently, he
would refer to this amazing sportsman, this

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.230
ice-hockey player by name Wayne Gretzky.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.930
Probably more famous than Sachin Tendulkar
is in cricket, this man, for twenty years,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.190
he played for Canada, he played ice hockey.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.350
Set so many records that still stand unbroken.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.750
So, this man used to say, when asked what
his secret was, … Very simple.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.630
Very simple secret.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.740
Everybody goes to where the puck is.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.600
(The puck is the disc-like ball in ice-hockey.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.060
That is the ‘ball’ used in ice hockey.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.090
Looks like a disc.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.290
Floats along on the ice surface).

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.320
Everybody goes to where the puck is.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.350
But I, I go to where the puck will be.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.570
If you wonder why Jonty Rhodes is such an
amazing fielder in cricket, well, that’s

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.540
because he had that uncanny sense.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.980
He will go to where the ball will be when
he is in that curved path.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.450
That is his amazing skill.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.901
So, when you are investing time and money
in a course you want to subscribe for, in

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:56.660
a degree you want to invest time and money
in, be very very careful!

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.890
If everybody is saying this is the hot field,
this is what we need to do, this is what will

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.470
be the future, it is probably, already, a
little too late.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:17.540
So, discuss around freely, think deeply, and
skate to where the puck will be!

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.270
Thank you!
