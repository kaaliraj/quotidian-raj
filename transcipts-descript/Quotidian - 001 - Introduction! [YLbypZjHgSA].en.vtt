00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Hello!

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.149
My name is Rajendran!

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.020
I am launching this playlist, titled “Quotidian”,
on my YouTube Channel.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.580
I want to meet you daily, with a little tidbit
of interesting information.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.669
Let me give you a brief introduction about
what this is.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.430
Let me first introduce myself to you, who
I am, and what I do.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.320
I am Rajendran Dandapani, and I have been
employed at this company called Zoho Corporation,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.789
for the past 25 years, right from the day
it was founded.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.310
My current role involves managing engineers
who build world class software applications.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.990
At the same time, ever since 2005, we have
been running an interesting academic experiment

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.990
called “Zoho Schools”.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.860
I teach programming, design, marketing, and
soft-skills at this Zoho Schools of Learning.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.360
As I grew more mature, with age and experience,
I have also been teaching the art of managing

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.950
to many of my colleagues.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.280
And, at Zoho Schools, I lead a group of faculty
members, in my current role as President.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.480
So, if I step back and take a look, a typical
day for me involves Managing, Teaching, Teaching

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480
Managing, and Managing Teaching!

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:21.140
So, the stuff that I share with you every
day, I am guessing they will fall within one

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.330
of these four boxes!

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Okay!

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.330
So, what then is a Quotidian?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.060
And, why am I even doing it?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.350
First up, the word “Quotidian”.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.930
The dictionary definition goes something like
this:- “Daily, Commonplace, Mundane”..

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.640
Something that one sees nearly every day.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.340
The boring, the usual, the uninteresting!

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.570
So, I am setting the expectations very clearly.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.220
It is important that you understand up front
what you can expect from these!

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:03.200
All I am trying to do here is share with you,
the little nuggets, tidbits, tchotchkes, that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.659
I encounter day to day, that I find interesting…

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.430
A “Quotidian” from me may just be that.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.430
Quotidian!

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.050
Taking a second look at the word, one sees
that it is a portmanteau of “Quotes” and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.050
“Comedian”.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:29.450
We will be sharing and discussing a lot of
famous words and quotes by historic luminaries..

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.439
And, people call me a comedian often.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.829
An inappropriate comedian sharing noteworthy
quotes!

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.810
That’s what you’ll get here.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.180
If you see the number, I haven’t mentioned
it as “1” or “01”.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:56.659
I chose “001” because I wanted to tell
myself that this is 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.519
a marathon.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.709
A long game.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.780
Set my destination far into the future.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.549
I have thus told myself that I should take
this all the way to a thousand episodes!

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.430
Such explicit goal-setting and public-sharing
might even force me, remind me, encourage

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.849
me, egg me on, if on some day I doze off,
miss doing this, or feel out of sorts.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.150
And, that’s the reason for the James-Bondish
numbering system!

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.709
There is a phrase in Japanese called “Kai
Zen”.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.140
Roughly translates to “Changing for the
Better”.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.140
Small changes.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.140
Atomic changes.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.140
Incremental improvements.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.439
Not a dark night suddenly turning into a bright
day.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.239
But a gradual onset of a dawn, through fifty
shades of grey.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.180
Any change, any meaningful transformation,
will have to proceed only through gradual

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.180
steps.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.209
Every day, to present something interesting
to you, I need to encounter it in the first

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.959
place, assimilate, make the connections, learn
from it, and share them with you!

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.750
So, it becomes a gentle positive pressure
on me to bake the “Today I Learned” phenomenon

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.750
right into my daily routine!

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.379
From the viewpoint of my wife, ever since
the Corona Lockdown started, I had lost motivation

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.230
to really groom myself, and the results were
turning out shabby.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:30.370
Now though, as I have to appear on camera
in front of you every day, present to you

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.449
“presentably”, I have to foam up and slide
down, if you know what I mean.

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.330
And, that is a clear benefit if ever there
was one!

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.190
Hugh Macleod, a famous author, cartoonist,
philosopher, overall smart guy, says “If

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.970
you are successful, it’ll usually never
come from the direction you predicted.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.759
(The same is true if you fail!)”.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.810
Whatever goal or destination you chose when
you got started, that is usually never the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.479
reason you succeed, that is usually never
the place you eventually reach.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.919
Failure works the same way too.

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.860
Both success and failure are usually from
“out of left field”.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.139
I don’t have some overarching goal or purpose
for starting this initiative.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.919
I want to learn something interesting everyday
so I can share it with you.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.889
Let’s see how it goes from here on out!

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.300
Thank you!
