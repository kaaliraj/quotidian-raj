00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.509
A Kamalahassan movie titled “Apoorva Sakotharargal”…

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.780
In that, Kamal will come up with a contraption
to perform an assassination.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.750
This Honda ad is quite similar too.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.300
Composed of spare parts from a Honda car,
this video shows a little spare part touching

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:55.730
another, triggering an action, setting something
in motion, and so on.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.990
You must have seen many videos like this one,
on the Internet.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:11.500
Can you connect this advertisement to a cartoonist
who was born nearly 150 years ago…?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.070
What links them both?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:34.720
Shall we see?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.280
Namaste!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.130
Four Hundred and Thirteen.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.710
It is all about dots!

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.300
This is the cartoonist I was referring to.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.980
Rube Goldberg is his name.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.130
And, they say, there have been many people
whose names have entered the dictionary, but,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.740
first name, last name, together, he is probably
the only guy to have entered the dictionary.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.630
A Rube Goldberg contraption, or a Rube Goldberg
machine, is a setup that is very very very

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.660
elaborate, almost as elaborate as somebody
touching their nose with their arm snaking

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.950
around the back, doesn’t achieve much, in
fact, it is silly and ridiculous.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.201
Always has a much straightforward, easy, simple
alternative that could have done the job.

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.280
But, there is a lot of creative genius involved.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.330
For example, let us look at just one of the
many many cartoon-like graphics that he has

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.680
drawn and given schematics for.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.500
The Simple Mosquito Exterminator is the name
of the invention.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.160
The mosquito enters window and walks along
board, which is strewn with small chunks of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.280
rare steak — after munching steak as he
walks, he is overcome by fumes coming from

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.040
sponge which is soaked in chloroform, and
falls on platform.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.280
When he regains consciousness, he looks through
telescope and spies reflection of bald head

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280
in mirror.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.560
He mistakes this for the real thing, jumps
off spring-board and dashes his brains out

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.569
against the mirror, falling lifeless in to
can.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.569
Silly?

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.569
Funny??

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.569
Creative!

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:25.450
The Rube Goldberg machine, or the Rube Goldberg
version of something, they call it.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.460
Creatively coming up with different moving
parts, each connected to the other.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.349
On BBC, there used to be a TV program called
Connections.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.050
A science-based TV program.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.510
There weren’t many, but this one, it was
called Connections, it ran for three seasons.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.940
It even came out in book form.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.209
The same scientist who played host, was the
author.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.250
James Burke was his name.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.750
In that creative, science-based television
series by James Burke, the standout feature

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.019
was how he stressed on the concept that “Science
did not have a roadmap.

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.019
It did not have a plan.

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.019
We have got this invented.

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.019
Next, we have to discover that.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.840
And then, we will be able to reach that destination.”

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840
etc.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
No!

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.999
Science just kept collecting one after the
other, and then, a structure started to emerge.

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:30.330
Only after turning the corner off a narrow
street, one gets to view the wide highway

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.909
that opens up to the left!

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:42.699
He takes the example of how the nuclear bomb
actually came about.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.860
He starts with gold.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.930
People used to cheat by mixing other metals
with gold.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.360
And along the way, there was one invention.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.479
A touchstone.

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:01.520
This touchstone was able to prove whether
it was pure gold or not.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.229
And, when this happened, people switched from
bartering to currency.

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:19.800
And, because of the arrival of this currency,
Alexander became a very famous king, he was

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.300
able to occupy a lot of territory, and he
brought knowledge from all around the world,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.580
and there was a library, created in Alexandria.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.800
The library of Alexandria.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.400
It became the collection-point for a LOT of
information.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.800
From the far corners of the world.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.900
One of the pieces of information?

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.900
Star maps.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.559
How to navigate by looking at and tracking
the stars up there in the sky.

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:46.699
Information about that.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.529
And, because that information proved accurate
and useful, Man was able to venture out into

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.529
the Seas.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.599
Places He hadn’t been to, before.

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:03.970
And, only when He started doing that, he was
suddenly shocked to realise, that this compass

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.969
wasn’t pointing towards the North Star,
but was instead reacting to the magnetic field

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:17.789
of this thing called Earth itself!

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.289
And, he started experimenting!

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:29.830
And, from that experimentation, came Electricity.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.899
This led to much research about atmospheric
electricity.

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:35.720
Can we bring those two things together, was
the question.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:44.539
The Wilson Cloud Chamber was the answer.

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.149
To talk about the atmospheric effects of electricity.

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:53.039
An indirect discovery there was the boundless
energy hidden inside the atom.

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:06.719
If we were to aim a fast proton on to the
nucleus of another atom, we would see the

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.629
release of that energy!

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:17.280
Gold replaced the barter system, one connected
with the other, and finally we have the nuclear

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280
bomb.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.039
If we look back, we can see all the dots connecting.

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:29.619
But, we can’t start with the goal, an end
goal.

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.650
That would be severely limiting.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:37.539
It would be too blinding, says James Burke.

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:39.119
Connecting the dots.

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:47.189
We have all watched The Big Bang Theory, haven’t
we?

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.589
The television series.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:51.399
My favourite character in it?

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.879
Sheldon of course!

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.539
It could be this young man.

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:57.619
Or, it could be this tiny tot too.

00:07:57.619 --> 00:08:05.800
But, one thing that stands out when we think
of them, is their intellect.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.550
The precocious kid, or the genius-level college
researcher.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.589
We always look up to this guy.

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:21.150
Socially, probably, he is not very well-adjusted,
but, wow, every time, he would be the smart

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.219
resolver!

00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:32.860
For Sheldon, in the Big Bang Series, they
would dedicate a small video series inside,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.430
do you remember?

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:40.630
It wasn’t about Explaining Physics or Understanding
Chemistry.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.630
It was about having Fun with Flags.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.020
So many countries.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.400
So many flags.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:56.490
This man has a nearly photographic, eidetic
memory, and he would talk about each country

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.890
and its flag.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:06.980
Why do you think they picked something to
do with memory, and a childhood obsession,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.370
when talking about probably the smartest man
in television?

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.680
Is there a connection hidden there?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.540
We know this person.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.980
Viswanathan Anand.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.500
A book about him, by him.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.620
Called Mind Master.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.200
He talks about something pretty confessional.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:39.950
You may lower your opinion about me if I tell
this to you frankly, he starts.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:47.230
He talks about how he forgets their wedding
anniversary, and his wife mocks him for his

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.580
so-called photographic memory.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.660
Aruna is her name.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.950
And, for this scolding he receives from her,
he shares a research that collected data about

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:59.350
the so-called photographic memory of chess
players at various levels.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:05.240
From a beginner, an intermediate player, a
Master, and a Grandmaster.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.260
They tested how good the memory of these players
were.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.350
The way they tested it?

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.440
They gave a lot of chess positions.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.350
They were tested on how well those positions
were remembered and recollected a while later.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:29.150
Were they able to recall those positions blindfolded?

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.150
And propose a best next move?

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.930
Clearly, the Grandmaster was able to recall
and reproduce, but the beginner was clueless.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.650
He couldn’t do well.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:47.050
You know what they did next with the same
groups of people?

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.131
They randomised the chess positions.

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:57.420
These positions simply won’t happen in the
natural flow of the game of chess.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:04.630
Giving them such random positions, the researchers
tested their memory power once again.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:09.750
The Grandmaster and the Intermediate player
and the Beginner?

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.850
They all performed equally BADLY.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:17.200
What is Anand trying to say here?!

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.290
That this Memory prowess of chess champions
is actually a myth.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.260
We don’t really remember every piece in
every position.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:35.710
We get an overall sense of groups, of valid
next positions, … That’s what the Mind

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.920
Master, the Chess Genius, says.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:44.890
I am able to memorise and remember meaningful
positions, but I am clueless when it comes

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.390
to complicated positions that don’t really
occur in reality.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.740
We have encountered Metcalfe’s Law.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:12:05.360
If a node exists in a network, the number
of different combinations that can result

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.530
from it is directly dependent on how many
other nodes there are.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:15.560
In a crowd of entities, as the number of entities
grow, the number of interactions among them

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560
grows exponentially.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.930
If there are three nodes, only three connections
are possible.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.500
But, if there are five, it is ten.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.840
If seven, twenty-one.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.730
And, among just nine entities, we see a full
thirty-six connections being revealed.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.600
Isn’t it readily apparent from this?

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.180
If you have one little entity of knowledge
in your mind, you have one idea.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:49.780
But, if you have three entities, you have
three ideas, and if you have more entities,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.070
the number of interconnecting ideas, (for,
it is in interconnections that ideas are actually

00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:01.240
born!), for that number to go up, you need
to have more entities in the first place.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.800
Do you see that from Metcalfe’s Law?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.360
His name is David Perell.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.250
He has written a lot about a concept called
The Personal Monopoly.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:19.490
To stand out in the world, to stand out on
the Internet, to be an exclusive personal

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.350
brand, his advice is that you have to go deeper
and deeper and narrower and narrower, you

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:31.610
will have to keep overlapping and looking
at that overlap zone, until you are the World’s

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.550
Expert in what YOU do.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:46.930
And, David Perell says, a life of creativity
is all about collecting the dots, yes…

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:54.250
You need to first be divergent, voraciously
pick and collect from everywhere.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:14:00.010
After that, you will have to spend time connecting
the dots.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:05.980
And, only after that, you emerge with YOU
as your personal brand.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.540
He calls it the DICE framework.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:16.460
You DIverge and Collect; and then, having
collected, you Converge by connecting them

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:24.120
up; and finally, having created your personal
identity, you branch out and Emerge!

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.880
And, those dots?

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.100
What are they really?

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.780
It may be information.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.930
It may be contacts.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.880
People you know!

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.190
It may be exposure to environments!

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.940
(I have been in a corporate environment.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.420
I have been in the Arctic cold.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.190
I have attended a Western music event.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:53.800
All of these are experiences from unique environments).

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.630
It could be new ways of thinking.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.890
How would my project plan change if I had
an infinite budget?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:04.610
How would we paint this if I were allowed
only blue and shades of blue as my constraint?

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:14.330
If the weapon I had in my hand were only a
hammer, how will we open this box?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.800
It could be new ways of thinking.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.650
It could be new points of view.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:23.310
If a mosquito or a fly perceived the world,
with a million little eyes, how would the

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.550
world look?

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:30.070
If Cyclops, with the famous third-eye, how
would he observe the world, how would he thread

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.350
a needle…?

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.350
Points of view.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:39.020
So, each of those dots need not be bits of
information alone.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.880
It could be all of what I said just now.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.480
He calls it the DICE framework.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.980
Diverge (collect, collect, collect), then
Converge (by connecting), and then, Emerge!

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.920
I want to extend this a bit.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.430
Instead of DICE, I want to call it DICES.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.850
Add a little thing at the end.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.250
I hope he wouldn’t mind.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.000
That S is for Sharing.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.430
You have collected.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.860
You have connected.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.589
You also have to Share with the others.

00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:19.400
Not as a benevolent, altruistic, friend of
the world.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:26.280
For personal gain, for selfish benefit, you
can benefit simply by Sharing.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.360
Want to know why?

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.490
There is an App like this.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.190
It is called Shadowmatic.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.880
Available both on Android and iPhone.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.860
And, let me play a sample video for you.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.520
It is about a wall.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.010
Two/three pieces hanging in air, casting a
shadow.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:17:02.020
Seems to make no sense, when you look at these.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:11.179
But, when you look across to the wall, something
is taking shape!

00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:15.110
Those dots that you collected from one point
of view, that you connected from one personal

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:20.829
point of view, will be influenced and biased
by your own mindset.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:35.029
But, when you share and give away those dots,
somebody else, obviously from some other viewpoint

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:41.029
will look at it, and what wasn’t apparent
to you, the seahorse, they may be able to

00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:42.820
recognise it right away.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.779
And they, in turn, will give it away back
to you.

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:53.220
And, that’s when two plus two becomes, not
four, not five, but probably twenty-two.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.309
DICES.

00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:57.409
Diverge.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.499
Collect.

00:17:59.499 --> 00:18:01.600
Converge.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.690
Connect.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.789
Emerge.

00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:07.889
Share.

00:18:07.889 --> 00:18:16.619
My closing thought for today is a little deeper
dig into the greatest minds that we have seen

00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:18.340
in recent times.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.340
Steve Jobs.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.840
We all remember this quote of his, from the
Stanford Commencement Address.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.039
Creativity is about connecting the dots, you
can only connect the dots backwards.

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:31.130
But…, an autobiography titled “I, Steve”.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:36.500
In that, he talks again about these dots.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:42.460
And, what did he say there?

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.230
He says, “Creativity is about having enough
dots to connect!”

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:52.659
Some people, simply because of the minimal
experiences and exposures they have had, become

00:18:52.659 --> 00:18:53.659
a one-track mind.

00:18:53.659 --> 00:18:55.480
They can have only limited thoughts.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:03.480
But, when you collect seemingly unconnected
experiences, they get to a better position,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:11.759
and they are able to see patterns where others
only see dots.

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:18.019
We will meet again.

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:19.679
Thank you!
