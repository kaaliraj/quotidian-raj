00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.730
This word, Idea, I tried exploring where this
was originally from. And guess what, it comes

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.985
from the Greek and the Latin root, and the
meaning of that root? To see! And, not just

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:34.090
see without any purpose… To see and recognise
a pattern. That is an idea. To see and recognise

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.800
a pattern!

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:59.401
Namaste! Ennakkaru Mazhai! Not just one idea,
how to get a LOT of ideas! How to get a lot

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:04.299
of GOOD ideas! That is what we are going to
see today!

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:14.560
There is this book — How to get ideas — by
Jack Foster. This man… the book… is extremely

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.310
creative. Illustrations are amazing. And,
it is divided into two parts. The first part

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:32.380
is about how to get your mind ready for amazing
ideas. And, while talking about that, he says

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:42.220
things that we have already seen in all these
409 episodes. Nothing new really. But… the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.990
way he says it.. The example he uses.. They
were really interesting, and I thought I should

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.240
share them, at least some of them, with you.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.580
Ten ways to idea-condition your mind. To prepare
it. To get it ready. To keep it on the alert

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.289
so that if the idea “flies by”, you will
be able to immediately grab and catch it.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.859
That is the question in front of us. And here
are ten beautiful answers.

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:22.910
Number One is Have fun! We have seen this
already. Because the funny mind is the creative

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:31.110
mind. We have seen a lot of examples for this.
He draws the concept of a joke. He says, “Hey,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.959
take a look at this joke.” For example,
“What is the best thing about Switzerland?”

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:44.459
is the question. And, how do we give an answer
to that? How do we make it witty?!” “I

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.159
don’t know, but the flag is a big plus!”
Do you see the double meaning? In the last

00:02:52.159 --> 00:03:03.489
turn? Suddenly a bulb glows and it makes it
funny! This is the characteristic of any joke!

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.930
The author catches on to this, and says, “An
unexpected direction change. A 180-degree

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:21.760
U-turn. Later, it sounds perfectly logical,
though. That is the key concept of a great

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.260
idea also, not just a joke.” In the 1970s,
there was this new concept that came along.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.949
Regenerative Braking. It is by default installed
in any new electric car these days. When you

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:40.499
apply the brakes on your vehicle, instead
of losing the energy as heat, burnt rubber,

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:49.139
wear and tear, etc, imagine if we could convert
the kinetic energy of your vehicle into charge

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:59.400
for the battery, so it can be useful the next
time you want to accelerate! It is that unexpected

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.280
directional change, that later sounded, “Hey,
that’s perfectly logical, da!” So, have

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:16.939
fun, crack jokes, make way for ideas to come
and take hold of you.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:26.710
Number Two is “Be more like a child”.
Like a child. Not childish. But, childlike.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.270
Curiosity. We have seen numerous examples
— about capturing that childlike curiosity.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.860
He uses one from Dr. Albert Einstein himself.
There have been countless stories about him,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.900
and there are quite a few interesting stories
that feature him and his love for children.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:56.280
In one of his interviews, he has said this:-
“Everybody when we were children, we ask

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.819
questions about time and space. How large
is this universe? How long will this still

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:12.639
be around? What happened long ago? How fast
is something? How heavy is something? We have

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:24.570
always been asking these questions as a child.
As we grow up, we stop asking those questions.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:33.300
In my case, probably my development was retarded.
I didn’t grow up like everybody else. I

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:42.620
was retarded. And so, when I had the tools,
like calculus and other powerful tools, when

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:50.759
I had them in my hand, I was still asking
those childlike questions, and that is what

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:58.340
probably helped me!” He said this in all
humility. So, be more like a child. For a

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.020
child, if it enters an environment, every
day is a new day! Every environment is a new

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:13.870
environment. Remember the movie, 50 First
Dates? Like that! Can you be like that? That

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.300
may pave the way to a beautiful, idea-rich
world for you.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:28.520
Number Three is to become “Idea-Prone”.
If it starts raining, it should POUR! How

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:36.430
do you do that? He gives an example of an
advertising agency. He works at an advertising

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.620
agency himself. Where, once, there was this
assignment. “We need to create this billboard,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:51.060
and publish it tomorrow, for a Swiss Army
Knife”. They think of a lot of options and

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.169
alternatives, but all of them seem old and
usual. They are not able to come up with something

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:03.460
new. 24 hours pass by, nobody has any new
idea, for they were looking for one single

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:12.500
beautiful idea. The spec is changed… The
boss comes and says, “I need ten ideas from

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.129
each of you! By lunch time!” So, when a
time tension is added, a deadline is added,

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:26.039
and a large quantity is expected as the output,
some of them brought twenty five!! So, what’s

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:34.389
he trying to say? When you know that there
is a solution possible for a problem, the

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:41.430
way you approach the problem changes! When
you are wondering whether this problem even

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:47.440
has a solution or not, you approach it differently
from, when you know that this problem doesn’t

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.430
have just one solution but actually ten, and
let us come up with some! Similarly, push

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.560
away the self-doubt that echoes “Can I even
do this at all?” You have to tell yourself

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:06.270
that you can do it. So, there are two things
to keep in mind. First, there are many many

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:14.289
many solutions out there. And, the second,
YOU can get there! You can do it! That’s

00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:19.990
how you make your psyche idea-prone.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.539
Number Four is about visualising success.
We have heard of so many stories, read so

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:33.261
many books, about the power of creative visualisation.
You know what the examples he uses are? He

00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:40.530
says, imagine you are walking along a very
narrow path. Just ten inches wide. Between

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:49.060
two tall buildings! They are calling you over.
“Come! Come to the other side!” You are

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:55.699
afraid. You are terrified. You are concerned
about the wind, concerned about the height,

00:08:55.699 --> 00:09:01.741
concerned about one misstep, concerned about
the sweat on your forehead, concerned about

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:09.320
the crow that is coming towards you… But,
imagine this same scenario with just a small

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.810
twist. Your 12-week-old waif, that little
helpless baby is being dangled from the other

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:22.510
side. “Come! Or else..!” is the threat.
Will you go now? — asks the author. Yes

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:32.810
of course! And, what’s the difference? The
difference is the visualisation that you do

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:38.940
in the second scenario! What if the child
is dropped?! It is not about all the other

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:45.160
problems you were concerned about.. Your focus,
your visualisation, is about that end goal.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.790
Just make that change to your approach. There
was an experiment, in a college. They conducted

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:59.380
this experiment on basketballer-girls. They
don’t know the game much, the sixty girls.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:07.459
They are split into three groups of twenty.
The first twenty are trained from Day 1 to

00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:13.491
Day 20. Their accurancy is measured on Day
1. Then again on Day 20. Free throw success

00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:22.829
percentage is measured. Of course it has improved
for them. A full 24%. The second twenty, they

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:26.500
are measured on Day 1. The next twenty days
nothing much happens. No training. Nothing.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:33.100
Twentieth day they are measured again. Of
course, zero percent improvement. But, you

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:39.709
know what was shocking?! The third twenty
of them, the coach said, “You don’t need

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:48.340
to come to the court.. But, visualise yourself
shooting. Visualise your body posture. Visualise

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:55.260
the ball going through the net. Hear that
swooshing sound as it slips without hitting

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:04.810
the ring. Hear the crowd applauding you!”
For twenty days, that’s what they did. Shock

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:11.050
of shocks!! Twenty-three percent improvement,
in free throw shooting percentage, just sitting

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:17.120
in a couch visualising! So, visualise the
end goal. Automatically ideas will come, he

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120
says!

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:25.620
Number Five is about Rejoicing in Failure.
It is only through Failure can you actually

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.370
Win — is something we have seen often here.
We have also heard that Failure is the stepping

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:39.769
stone for Success. He brings, though, two
crucial professions. One of them is race car

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:52.259
driving. The other is that chef in that restaurant
who is experimenting. For both of these professionals,

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:58.440
success, the highest level of success, when
do they really realise that they have done

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:05.920
it, they have reached it? When there is a
crash for the racecar driver, he would tell

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.389
himself, “I should try all but this!”
When there is a disaster in the kitchen, “All

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:19.250
but this, I should try!”, the chef tells
himself. So, you have to explore the edges

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:27.519
of Failure before you know to define Success
for yourself. Isn’t that beautiful?!

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:34.300
Number Six is about getting more inputs! If
you want to become really good at something,

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:45.529
to be creative, you have to take inputs from
EVERYWHERE! One guy,… I will read it out

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:56.000
to you, it is so interesting…! His name
is Jeff Weakley. This guy had sent the most

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.180
interesting resume ever, to the author! So,
what was so special about the resume? Well,

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:11.660
it said, … The illustration showed a man’s
head piled high with junk — broken pencils,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:26.730
old tires, bottles, and so on. The headline
said: “Invest in a junk pile.” The copy

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:37.180
said: “I read the labels on toothpaste tubes.
I have been a disc jockey. I have been a door-to-door

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:45.730
salesman. I have studied and worked with film,
television, radio, and photography. I play

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:51.580
sports, speak Spanish, and know the names
of all the teeth in my mouth. I have read

00:13:51.580 --> 00:14:01.190
a lot of books and seen a lot of movies. I
know of a disease that causes men to eat dirt,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:06.259
ice, and laundry starch. Most importantly,
I know something dual-in-line-package 14-pin

00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:15.839
quad two-input NANS gates. I’ve always been
like that. I’ve created in my mind this

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:25.120
giant junk pile of seemingly worthless information.
And then I discovered advertising. The junk

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:31.800
pile became a treasure overnight. As I am
at the earliest stages of my advertising career,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:39.600
I am offering you the opportunity to invest
in this junk pile. For a very good price.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:49.300
If you’re interested in seeing the rest
of my collection, please call.” How interesting!!

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:55.540
Collect! Because, you never know when you
may be able to make some interesting connections

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:05.560
and come up with an amazing idea. Be a voracious
reader. Be a voracious observer!

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:16.290
Number Seven is about courage! You need guts.
You need the gumption to actually put it out

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.750
in the open. There are a lot many stories.
Rejection stories. About the number of failures

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:27.920
faced by Thomas Alva Edison, the number of
rejection slips that J K Rowling collected.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:39.050
How to face rejection though? Instead, listen
to this story! In our office, there was this

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:44.879
review happening of creative ideas, and the
boss said, “Sorry, this is bad, come up

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:53.389
with another!” At that time, a colleague
gave me this good advice. It seems that guy

00:15:53.389 --> 00:16:01.290
next to him said, “Wow, this is an opportunity
for us to come up with a better idea!” In

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:08.600
other words, you look at yourselves as an
engine that can keep creating ideas always

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:15.129
better than the previous one! For, if you
don’t create an idea as good as or better

00:16:15.129 --> 00:16:22.900
than your previous one, you will be replaced!
You have to retire! So, as long as you are

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:29.420
pumping them out, “Wow!, an opportunity
to come up with even better!” should be

00:16:35.555 --> 00:16:37.216
is the attitude.

00:16:37.216 --> 00:16:46.905
Number Eight is about teaming up. Instead
of going it all the way alone, idea-brainstorming

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:55.095
should ideally include two/three people. Together!
The results will be usually special! As an

00:16:55.095 --> 00:17:05.966
example, he quotes the Schick shaving foam
warming device. They had come up with an invention

00:17:05.966 --> 00:17:12.636
to warm the shaving foam. If you apply it
on your cheek, it will be warm and comforting,

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:17.686
particularly if you live in cold countries.
Everything looked good, they surveyed potential

00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:25.246
buyers, everybody seemed to want one, but
somehow, the product never sold in high numbers..

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:28.996
Wondering what to do, wondering why it wasn’t
selling, worried that the advertising was

00:17:28.996 --> 00:17:37.226
perhaps below par, they brought the device
to this advertising agency. A small team had

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:42.486
been formed, they were discussing, they were
debating, and then, one of them, thankfully

00:17:42.486 --> 00:17:49.746
a lady, she stood up and said, “Everything
is perfect, except that you are selling it

00:17:49.746 --> 00:17:54.686
to the wrong people.. It is not to the men
that you should be selling this, it is to

00:17:54.686 --> 00:18:01.396
the women who are looking for what to gift
their husband on the coming Christmas. It

00:18:01.396 --> 00:18:13.516
is the perfect gift a woman can give a husband!”
So, this is the benefit you get when you have

00:18:13.516 --> 00:18:19.936
some opposing minds, looking at the problem
from two different directions, arriving at

00:18:19.936 --> 00:18:27.167
the solution in double quick speed… But,
wait, he does give two additional bits of

00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:32.726
advice too. Don’t bring in too many cooks!
Decision by committee is always flawed! And,

00:18:32.726 --> 00:18:37.706
similarly, brainstorming with your boss may
be a bad idea, because, brainstorming expects

00:18:37.706 --> 00:18:44.536
you to be ready to be a fool, to be made an
ass..! Check if your boss is ready for such

00:18:44.536 --> 00:18:48.846
treatment, or if you are ready for it in front
of your boss!

00:18:48.846 --> 00:18:56.826
Number Nine is about Lateral Thinking. Think
different. Think from a different angle. The

00:18:56.826 --> 00:19:03.856
example he quotes for this is a story from
a company in Korea. They set up an amazing

00:19:03.856 --> 00:19:07.276
training department. They told their employees,
“We just need the right attitude. Even if

00:19:07.276 --> 00:19:12.516
you walk in with zero skills, we will train
you, we will train you in all the skills needed,

00:19:12.516 --> 00:19:19.166
we will do everything to make you a well-rounded
professional!” There was only one problem..

00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:26.476
These people, after finishing their training,
they were poached by other companies in the

00:19:26.476 --> 00:19:30.086
city. Why?! With such a consummate training
program, the other companies were ready to

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:34.666
pay twice, were ready to send a pickup limo
to their home, give skyhigh perks, gift an

00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:38.526
iPhone to each employee, … they just wanted
the person to jump ship! They were taken away

00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:43.216
by all those other companies who were probably
having more money, but who didn’t have as

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:48.126
good a training department as this company…
They worried, wondered, debated, what was

00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:54.716
to be done about this, and then, one guy,
in exasperation, commented, “I think we

00:19:54.716 --> 00:20:02.476
should take everybody into a room, and just
chop their legs off.. That may be the only

00:20:02.476 --> 00:20:10.746
way to prevent them from walking off!” You
know what happened? Just a little extension

00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:19.736
of that, just a few days later, that germ
of an idea germinated a little more, and this

00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:27.116
Korean company decided they would recruit
only handicapped people on wheelchairs. Because,

00:20:27.116 --> 00:20:35.336
their company was wheelchair-friendly. Sloped
access ways near staircases, wheelchair-compatible

00:20:35.336 --> 00:20:41.567
elevators and toilets. The other companies
could not do that, and there was no way they

00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:46.916
could recruit wheelchair-bound specialists.
How interesting?!

00:20:46.916 --> 00:20:52.776
And, finally, Number Ten is about connection,
it is about combination. We have seen a lot

00:20:52.776 --> 00:21:01.166
many examples, but the one this author gave
was pretty interesting! He said, we have always

00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:07.626
had coin punches — from way back in the
times of kings and queens. Way back! Tens

00:21:07.626 --> 00:21:15.796
of thousands of years ago! Similarly, the
winepress? The one that crushes the juice

00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:23.516
out of grapes? That too, has been around for
hundreds and hundreds of years. But, it took

00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:32.276
a person who knew how both of these work,
to bring them together creatively, and create

00:21:32.276 --> 00:21:39.836
that Gutenberg printing press. The first printing
press. He was able to bring one idea from

00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:45.216
somewhere, another idea from somewhere else,
bring these two creatively together, like

00:21:45.216 --> 00:21:51.066
a mashup, and do this! Interesting!

00:21:51.066 --> 00:21:58.456
My closing thought is actually an invitation,
to know more about this guy, Randall Munroe.

00:21:58.456 --> 00:22:04.436
Randall Munroe is an author, a cartoonist,
a physicist, an engineer. Overall big shot!

00:22:04.436 --> 00:22:10.026
Do you remember these cartoon stick figures?
Some of you may recall the association with

00:22:10.026 --> 00:22:19.766
the XKCD series. He is the guy who produces
these daily! He has published them as books

00:22:19.766 --> 00:22:24.156
too. Amazing books. One of them is called
“What if”. This book is filled with What

00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:32.306
If questions.. Like, “How would it be to
swim in a swimming pool filled with nuclear

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:39.966
explosion residue fluid?” Like “If I were
to pitch a baseball at 90% the speed of light,

00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:51.396
how will you swing at it?” Like “If every
human being on earth is taken to one location,

00:22:51.396 --> 00:22:58.516
one island, and everybody press their foot
down strong and hard, at the same time, what

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:03.816
would happen?” For questions like these,
he gives answers, with proper proof and scientific

00:23:03.816 --> 00:23:16.836
support, and with wit too! Go, get creative!
Thank you! And yes, we will meet again soon!

00:23:16.836 --> 00:23:23.426
Bye bye!
