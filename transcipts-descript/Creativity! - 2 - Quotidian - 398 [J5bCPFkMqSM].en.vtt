00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:07.569
In Quotidian 397, I had said that we would
be looking at Creativity, and that we would

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.759
look at it in the context of the Hare and
the Tortoise.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.900
Actually, we will involve a third animal.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.750
That’s the Python.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.980
Before we get in, I just wanted to tell you
something that came to mind..

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.310
Muyal..

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.630
Aamai..

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.930
Who wins this tussle?

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
The answer to that question…

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.610
If you put the effort, you will win…

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.160
That beautiful meaning..

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.540
it is hidden right there in the word..

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.300
Bring these two animals together?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.200
Muyal..

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.100
Aamai…

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.000
Muyalaamai!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.900
Wow!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.700
Creative, eh?!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.590
Vanakkam!

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:13.090
We were looking at Creativity!

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:21.719
Let us do an extension, a second episode on
the same subject.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:22.990
Creativity.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.969
This guy, John Cleese.

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.170
You might have seen him as an actor.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.610
A comedian.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.759
A character actor.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.789
In a lot of movies.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.680
He has acted in Shrek. in Harry Potter too!

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.110
As a ghost!

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.429
Also, he has played roles in many famous British
comedies and series.

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:55.999
But, incidentally, his greatest contribution
is that famous British comedy series called

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.110
Monty Python.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.240
In fact, Guido van Rossum, the inventor of
the amazing programming language called Python,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.890
when asked why he named it such an odd thing,
he is supposed to have said that he was a

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.360
great fan of Monty Python.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.680
That Monty Python and the Flying Circus?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.500
Was created by John Cleese.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.910
This John Cleese had written a book on Creativity.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.810
A Short and Cheerful Guide.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.560
I encountered a few truly interesting concepts
in that book, and that is what I am going

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.940
to share with you today.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.460
First up, he gives a very important piece
of advice.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.460
“Stop The Thinking”.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.920
You see, we just saw in the previous episode
— networks in the brain, action network,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.230
imagination network, salience network…

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.230
That might lead one to think that perhaps
Creativity needs a lot of “Thinking” then?

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.230
No, says Cleese.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.190
That thing that comes and lightly taps you
on your back when you are not really “thinking

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.190
too much”?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.930
That is Creativity, says John Cleese.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.030
And he gives some examples.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.100
Consider tying your shoelaces.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.660
You don’t start your approach by thinking
this is where I start, it goes in here, then

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.420
I pull it through here, like this, and then
send it under that……. etc.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.230
If you start thinking like that, you will
actually make a mistake!

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.680
Have you noticed?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.890
If you are driving a car, have you noticed
that you can actually listen to music, you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.340
can be on the phone with somebody (hands-free)
probably, you can also have a conversation

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.860
with somebody in the car with you, .. but,
naturally, somehow automatically, instinctively,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.900
you turn at the right point, and somehow reach
home.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.900
How!

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.320
There is thinking happening without conscious
effort.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.420
And, that is the source of creativity, says
Cleese.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.680
Basketball, football, in any game for that
matter, that involves natural reflexes, coaches

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.460
always say, thinking is harmful!

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.940
Stop thinking, start playing, is their refrain!

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.780
You might wonder, how to play without thinking!

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.040
But, that is how you play naturally!

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.240
How should that action actually be?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:19.169
When somebody throws a brick at you, you instantly,
immediately, reflexively, instinctively duck.

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.400
You don’t look at it and say, “Oh, how
large is this brick, what angle is it coming

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.389
in, how much should I tilt my head, what velocity
is it coming in, etc”?

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.389
No!

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.150
So, stop thinking!

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.979
If you want to get your creative juices flowing,
don’t think too much!

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.409
Interesting advice!

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.830
And then he gives an example.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.000
About how subconscious creativity really does
its work.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.340
This is how it goes.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.669
He talks about an experiment that some American
scientists conducted on the American public

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.680
who had never seen Chinese letter.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.349
Those Chinese characters — they had never
seen them in life.

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.979
They were shown a pattern of five characters.

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.729
An hour later, they were shown a different
sequence of characters (some from the old,

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:22.729
many new).

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.490
When asked if they could recall which of those
were present in the first one, nobody could

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.490
really answer.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.330
Because, it was totally alien to them.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.219
They had never seen Chinese characters.

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.500
The same experiment.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.469
Conducted by the same scientists.

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.909
But, with a different end goal.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:53.660
This time, the scientists show a pattern,
and then, an hour later, they show another

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.229
pattern, and they ask the candidates, which
ones they “like”.

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:06.779
When asked this question though, for some
irrational, inexplicable reason, they seemed

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:20.060
to like the ones that they had actually seen
earlier (even though they couldn’t recall

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.070
having seen them!)

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.159
It is the subconscious sending you a message,
“Hey, I have actually seen it!

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.490
I don’t want to tell you I have seen it!

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.330
I am not your …… servant!

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.759
I am the creative genius sleeping inside you.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.360
But, you know what?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360
You have seen it.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.909
And, that is why I will make you LIKE it…!”

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:46.120
That will be the circuitous route in which
the message will really land!

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.120
Beware!

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.120
Be aware!

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
Await!

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.120
Observe!

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.349
Keep your eyes and ears open!

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.970
He brings another book in context.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:04.320
Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind — How intelligence
increases when you think less!

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.610
(Remember, John Cleese said “Stop The Thinking!”)

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:15.229
In this context, this Hare Brain, Tortoise
Mind actually resonates with the Daniel Kahneman

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:18.400
book “Thinking Fast and Slow”.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.439
That book too, gives the same advice.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.460
There are two kinds of systems in your brain.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.639
One is instantaneous.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.900
The other is slow and steady.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.590
How do they elaborate that same message in
this book then?

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.669
Well, this book says, the Hare Brain is reacting,
instantaneous, logical, analytical, evaluating,

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:43.669
deciding…

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:45.020
That is the Hare Brain.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.469
In fact, in English, there is a derogatory
term that goes “hare-brained”.

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:53.270
Too rashly deciding…

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.409
But, that is like System One.

00:07:55.409 --> 00:08:01.819
System Two on the other hand, the Tortoise
Mind, how does it work?

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:05.740
Well, it doesn’t even think it is working!

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.160
It is playful.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.169
It is leisurely.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:11.699
It is dreamy.

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.520
It is not even trying to solve the problem.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.349
It is pondering ABOUT the problem.

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:23.849
And, creativity lies in the mix of these two.

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:24.849
Not in one of them.

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:25.849
Not in the other.

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:27.270
But, in the interplay of these two.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:35.740
In equal parts, when they go hand in hand,
that is when creativity blossoms, says this

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.740
author.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:43.000
A few more things that this book talks about,
this book inside the other book.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.610
They conducted an experiment on architects.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.980
Architects do both things — they do analytical
thinking, because they have to build stuff

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.980
that stands.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.649
They can’t build something beautiful that
comes falling down.

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:56.269
But, nor can they build something stable but
ugly!

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:00.160
It has to be beautiful and functional too.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.740
Both kinds of creative!

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.080
They conduct an experiment on architects.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:12.259
They identify a large group of architects
famed for their creativity, and another group

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:14.380
of “also-ran” run-of-the-mill architects.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.839
They analyse both groups.

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:19.370
What is different in their lifestyles?

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.360
What do they do differently?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.360
What do they study?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.780
What is their background?

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.780
What are their hobbies?

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.899
How do they work?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:32.180
When evaluated thus, two beautiful discoveries,
this author makes.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.300
The first one?

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:42.959
The creative architects know that delaying
gives them great answers!

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:43.959
Delaying?

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:50.230
Well, postpone things till the very last moment
of the deadline!

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.390
If they have been told to get something done
in five days, they would keep toying with

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.279
ideas till the first half of the fifth day!

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:05.740
The not-so-creative architects just get an
idea, implement it, deliver before deadline,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.460
and move on.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:18.110
The creative architects know that delaying,
courting the fear and the panic of not having

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:26.000
arrived at a decision yet, … it seems that
fear should be confronted!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.600
The ticking clock!

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.780
The approaching deadline!

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.410
That is when you get amazing ideas!

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.640
Because ideas build upon existing ideas..!

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.210
The second differentiation that they made
between the creative and the not-so-creative

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.880
architects?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.509
The creative architects indulged in play!

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:48.940
They actually played!

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.690
Play?

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.730
Doing stuff without any end goal.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.339
Doing stuff not because it is work, but because
they love doing it.

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:04.959
Doing stuff without time deadlines, without
any end goal in sight.

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.110
I like it.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.940
I like fiddling with it.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.670
I like playing around with this puzzle.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.449
I am not interested in solving it.

00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:14.060
I am experiencing it.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.060
I am exploring it.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.519
I am looking at it from various perspectives.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.949
This is play!

00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:24.070
The creative architects played!

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.209
Think about it!

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:28.550
Do you have the guts to delay?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:34.880
Are you child-like enough to play!

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.160
Coming back to that Creativity book, there
were a lot of lessons in that book that we,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:47.180
Quotidian folk, have already experienced,
have been exposed to.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.850
Just the phrases themselves will ring a bell
for you.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.740
He talks about “Scratching your itch!”

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.470
He asks us to “Share your process!”

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.410
He advises us to “Copy!

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.410
Imitate!”

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.730
And, finally, he encourages us to not lose
hope.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.779
“Keep going!” he exhorts!

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:01.779
Atomically!

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:02.779
Small improvements!

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:03.779
We have seen all these, haven’t we?

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:10.970
But, there were a few other things that this
author shared that were really new.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.120
Almost like a wake-up call.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.449
Let us look at those now!

00:12:16.449 --> 00:12:20.329
One thing the author talks about is, “Killing
your darlings”.

00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:24.690
Don’t go around saying, “This is my baby.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.879
This is my idea”.

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:34.760
If you attach your personal ego to that, you
will end up being stuck with a suboptimal

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.810
idea.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:40.959
Old ideas need to be chased out mercilessly!

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:47.910
That is when the next idea will faithfully
come to you like an over-eager puppy!

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:53.220
Also, if your darlings aren’t good enough,
the competition is going to kill it.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.581
The other guy is going to kill it.

00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:57.290
It is better you kill them yourself.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:03.779
So, kill your darlings, says John Cleese!

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:07.269
Another advice he gives is, “Get Over Confidence”.

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:08.269
No!

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:09.920
I am not saying get over-confident!

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.660
Try and do away with “confidence” is what
he is trying to say!

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:21.610
This is because the moment you are sure about
something, the moment you are superconfident,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:30.449
the moment you feel you have learned all there
is to know, that moment, creativity flies

00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:34.800
away from you!

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.889
He warns you!

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:44.620
He says, most of us want to be right!

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.930
The creative geniuses want to know if they
are right!

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.399
Think about it!

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:53.750
If you want to be right, you will always do
the safe thing.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.009
You will always be “Let me do what everybody
else does.

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:58.009
Get away.

00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:59.009
Get paid.

00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:01.329
Go home.”

00:14:01.329 --> 00:14:04.030
What does the creative genius do differently?

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.550
He or she wants to know if they are right.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.240
So, they will make mistakes.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.459
They will try things nobody has tried before.

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:16.829
They will probably goof up.

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:20.440
They will change the goof up into something
amazing and interesting!

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.420
They will watch for responses!

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.810
And they will make further changes!

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.570
These people want to know if they are right!

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.750
They are humble.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.870
They are eager to please.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.820
They are agile enough to keep changing!

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.480
What a beautiful difference!

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.649
One more piece of advice he gives, the final
piece, I would say, is “Fix them yourself!”

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:46.560
You show your process to everybody.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.470
You ask them what they liked.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.019
Where it bored them.

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:54.370
What they didn’t like.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.019
And so on.

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:57.019
Yes.

00:14:57.019 --> 00:14:58.990
That is very very important.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:05.459
Ask people what they liked, what was boring,
what was unusual, what got them to the edge

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:06.459
of their seat.

00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:08.050
Ask all those questions.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:14.959
But, when the answers come, … they usually
won’t just answer the questions you ask

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:15.959
them.

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:20.610
They will also add their own suggestions,
their own solutions…

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.209
You know what, you should fix it like that..

00:15:23.209 --> 00:15:26.360
Use yellow instead of the green that you had
used.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:34.249
Instead of “Sa Ri” in this musical piece,
try “Sa Ga”….

00:15:34.249 --> 00:15:37.410
John Cleese says, “Take all that feedback.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:43.000
Split it up into ISSUES OBSERVED and SOLUTIONS
OFFERED.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.470
This second pack, wrap it up, give a plastic
smile, thank them, and throw it directly into

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.470
the trash.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.009
Because only you know how to fix them, how
to make them better!

00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:58.810
That is the final warning the author gives
us!

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.110
I really liked this bit!

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.860
Talking about the Closing Thought for today,
… it was this “Creativity”-beast that

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:13.459
got hold of me when I came up with the “digits
of Pi” sequence for my Quotidian series.

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:19.370
I had said I would jump a number of days in
the calendar corresponding to the digit of

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.449
Pi to line up my next Quotidian video!

00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:27.110
Things went well too…!

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.430
And only later I realised…

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.430
Zeroes come too!

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.189
The first one came on June 4th.

00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:41.640
When zero comes as my jump factor, the gap
between two episodes, what does that mean?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.440
I need to do two episodes on the same day!

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.440
My God!

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.639
It has been taxing!

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:49.860
Truly taxing!

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.209
Yes, creative, but it has got its own side
effects!

00:16:54.209 --> 00:16:55.769
Beware!

00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:56.990
Thanks a lot!

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.770
The next meeting is on June 6th!

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.690
Thank you!
