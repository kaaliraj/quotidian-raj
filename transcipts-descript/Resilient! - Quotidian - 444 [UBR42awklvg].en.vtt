00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:15.000
Watch this boxing match!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.780
…. This is not new!

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.349
Way back in the ’70s, Muhammad Ali had perfected
it.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.390
It is called the Rope A Dope technique.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.180
Look at the cockiness he demonstrates when
he adopts this strategy.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.180
He is going to… taunt!

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:45.950
“I dare you to hit me!”

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:56.574
And, see what he does now!

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:57.574
Taunting!

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:58.574
Taunting!

00:00:58.574 --> 00:00:59.574
What is the technique here?

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:05.010
It is the same technique that Rocky uses in
his movie.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.070
Sylvester Stallone will TIRE the opponent
by allowing him to punch him.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.290
“Hit me!

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.430
I will take it all, and then, when you are
tired hitting me, I will look for the right

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.900
opportunity and give you the knockout punch!”

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.009
That is what we are going to explore today.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.970
Resilience.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:45.050
To take it all, and bounce back.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:54.100
Namasthe!

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.950
Four Hundred and Forty Four is about Resilience.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.360
To come back…

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:16.740
Long long ago, around the late sixties, .. World
War Two had ended, the Cold War was in its

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:26.360
worst phase, and each country was desperate
to pile nuclear weapons.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.050
They could already destroy the whole world..

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.430
They could destroy it four times over.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.790
But, they would still be piling it sky high.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.790
Adding weapons.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.490
When asked why they were doing it, this is
what the premieres of each of those top countries

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.650
— USA, UK, Russia — said: We need second
strike capability.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.050
What is this Second Strike Capability?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:02.710
Well, if you have hit me first, I need to
withstand it completely, even if weapon armouries

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:11.080
are destroyed, even if my most populated zones
are decimated, even then, before I am completely

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.980
dead, I need to have enough firepower to ensure
you are dead too!

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.599
Sounds sick even to just listen to it.. but,
this was the reason they kept piling up.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.959
Mutually Assured Destruction.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:28.959
MAD.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.959
You are dead.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.720
I am dead too.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.890
Doesn’t matter at all who pressed the “Big
Red Button” first.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.909
That is Second Strike Capability.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.220
See, this guy hits back too!

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.120
We can think about it a bit more, and extract
something good too, out of this.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.909
Yes, Second Strike Capability was for mutually
assured destruction, but it is a good lesson

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:56.909
for us.

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:03.569
Like the Rope-A-Dope technique by Muhammad
Ali, how to take it all, and bounce back!

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:12.590
Even the internet, the decentralised network
of networks, was born because of a need like

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.930
this one.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.500
Nobody knows where the center of the internet
is and hence nobody can destroy the internet

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.830
with one carefully placed large explosive.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.229
And, that is why we are able to Facetime,
send messages, do Whatsapp calls.

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.710
Winston Churchill is supposed to have given
us a beautiful definition for success.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.910
It is nothing else..

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.870
It is just “going from failure to failure
without loss of enthusiasm”.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:54.120
Without losing any enthusiasm, go on to the
next failure, he said.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.520
Nice to hear.. but, a small correction is
needed here.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.580
You can’t do the same thing and expect a
different result.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.580
You have to do something different.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.460
Yes, failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm
is important, but, something has to be done

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.449
differently.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.430
If the PLAN doesn’t work, change the PLAN.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.560
Don’t change the goal!

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.270
Keep the ultimate aim the same, fixed firmly.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.190
But, the approach, the journey, can be flexible,
adaptable.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.090
That was a good suggestion.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:45.990
I came across a concept called the Chaos Monkey
recently.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.990
It is supposed to be a beautiful piece of
software used at Netflix.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.110
It really thrilled me to bits.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.880
What is the chaos monkey?

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.220
These are the servers that power Netflix and
Disney Hotstar.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.800
Left and right, hundreds of servers, responding
to your every request, streaming movies to

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.300
you on demand.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.580
The Chaos Monkey is a piece of software.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.520
What does it do?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.190
It simulates two monkeys.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.600
What do those monkeys do?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.810
They are mischievous.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.530
They will just randomly go and unplug servers.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.310
They will short servers.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.910
They will ensure some random server fails
every one hour.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.360
What a challenge?!

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.380
Why do you think Netflix instituted the Chaos
Monkey?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.229
It is available, open source.

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.389
You can do it for your own service.

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:54.170
If yours is as popular and as probably failure-prone
because it is so large as Netflix.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:00.180
“Anyway, some server, somewhere, once in
two days, burns out.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.180
Goes offline.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.180
We struggle.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.180
We suffer a lot.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.229
Because, we are in ‘reactive’ mode.

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:11.830
Once something happens, we rush in to fix
it, an urgent emergency.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:24.050
Instead, even before it really happens, what
if I simulate it myself?”

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.620
So, today, you wouldn’t even know if some
server has failed.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:36.770
Because the Chaos Monkey creates enough trouble
that the software engineers at Netflix have

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:43.400
ensured that even past that Chaos Monkey,
work gets done.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.500
Files get served.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.330
Redundancy takes care of resilience.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.280
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.650
There is a book called Forever Skills.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.490
I sincerely beg you not to read the book,
because we are going to touch upon parts of

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.370
the book very soon.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.599
But, this book’s intent is: Dear Friend,
the world IS changing!

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:11.080
The world HAS to change in some aspects.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.300
And, in some aspects, there won’t be ANY
CHANGE AT ALL.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:22.880
In such a change-prone world, what are the
skills that will be useful for me forever?!

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.610
She talks about twelve such skills, we will
come to them.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.790
But, one of them is resilience.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:40.010
Resilience is the ability to bounce back,
the ability to take it all, and say, “Enough

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:48.269
is enough”, and put your arm forward and
say, “Now I am going to re…do things”.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:49.269
RE.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:51.149
That is the key!

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:53.560
She talks about SIX DIFFERENT REs..!

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.029
And, this is what we are going to do!

00:08:57.029 --> 00:08:59.769
We are going to look at the Ramayana.

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:02.380
That amazing Epic.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.380
The Adi Kavya.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:10.459
And, we are going to try making a connection
between that story and these six words.

00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:11.800
Let’s get started.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.540
The first RE is REwork.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.790
You put in an effort.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.110
That didn’t bring the result you wanted.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.860
You try again.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.780
You try again and again.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:29.450
Like Winston Churchill’s exhortation, failure
to failure without losing enthusiasm.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.430
That is what Rama does, early in the middle
part of Ramayana.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:43.519
Seetha is gone, he has no idea where she is,
and, he keeps shouting, Seetha, Seetha,..

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:48.860
the sound echoes through the mountains.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.779
In fact, Valmiki says, every leaf cried..

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:55.779
Hearing the plaintive voice of Rama.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:58.660
He is a great man.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.209
A veritable Avatar.

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:03.610
But, he hasn’t realised it.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.190
He is acting human.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.110
And, he is reworking.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.290
Doing the same thing over and over again.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.630
Not enough.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.160
What is the second RE?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.930
The second RE is REgroup.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:24.240
When you are faced with something, and you
are not able to proceed any further, you need

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.029
to look at your forces, probably regroup.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:33.220
And, that is what Rama does, far away from
his kingdom.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.149
He is in exile.

00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:38.450
He can’t call for support resources.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.450
Backup.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:47.450
So, the squirrels in the neighbourhood, the
birds, the monkeys, the bears, he regroups.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.079
What is the third RE?

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:53.720
The third RE is REframe.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:03.730
When you can’t solve a problem, when the
problem seems insurmountable, smart people

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:11.089
probably start thinking, “Hey, we should
redefine the problem.

00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:13.290
We should reframe the problem.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.670
We can’t solve this problem holding on to
this world view.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.610
We should move it to another frame of reference.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.210
Hanuman is leaping across the ocean towards
Lanka.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:40.300
On the way, the Snake Goddess, mother of all
snakes, Surasa, obstructs him and says, “Sorry,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.130
you have to pass through my mouth”.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.990
So, what does Hanuman do?

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.200
Hanuman says, “I am larger.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.920
I am much larger than you think.”

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.940
And he starts expanding his size.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.019
Surasa starts expanding too.

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:01.959
And, more, more, more, more, inflation on
both sides.

00:12:01.959 --> 00:12:10.870
At one splitsecond, Hanuman becomes microscopic,
goes into the mouth, and flies out back again,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.000
and says, “Dear Madam, all you expected
of me was to ‘pass’ through your mouth.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.510
You didn’t ban me from coming out of the
same mouth.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.800
So, I have reframed the problem, and I have
succeeded in resolving it.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.890
Tata, byebye, I will be on my way!”

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.890
REframe.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.890
REward!

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.470
Remember “Start with Why”?

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.240
Senior managers and leaders look at the journey
as the reward.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.570
So, they don’t need any boosts along the
way.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:49.430
But, is it true for everybody?

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.240
That girl joined the workforce just yesterday.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.779
To give motivation to her.. the end point
might be too far away.

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:01.290
She may not have the stamina to last it.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:07.480
So, you need to give, at least once in a while,
rewards along the journey.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.660
It is keeping that in mind that Hanuman, on
his way back to Rama after meeting Seetha

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.370
and burning Lanka, when he is rallying all
the Vanaras to return to Rama with the good

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:24.209
news, at that moment, he discusses with the
senior folk and says, “Let us not just go

00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:25.529
directly to Rama.

00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:31.060
Let us ensure that these Vanaras get a little
play time..”

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.600
And that is how, at Madhuvan, Sugreeva’s
exclusive special private orchard with the

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:51.089
choicest fruits and flowers and honey, where
no Vanara had been allowed in till that day,

00:13:51.089 --> 00:13:55.070
the Vanaras, happy of their discovery of Seetha,
wreak havoc.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.730
There is bedlam!

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:04.139
Dadhimukhan, the guard Vanara, apologises
to Sugreeva that he tried his best, but couldn’t

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:06.399
protect the orchard from the marauding Vanaras.

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:13.860
That is when it strikes Rama and Lakshmana.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:20.000
If the Vanaras are behaving with such temerity,
… probably they have achieved what they

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.020
wanted to.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.810
Probably they are coming with good news, he
says.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.920
So, that, is Reward.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.339
What is the fifth RE?

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:33.550
The fifth RE is REinforce.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:43.889
Particularly, reinforce so that in one effort,
the enemy goes weaker and you get stronger.

00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:53.170
During Vibheeshana Sharanagathi, Ravana loses
an ally, and Rama gains a friend.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.500
This is a very important moment.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.660
“I am sorry my brother is behaving like
this.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:05.100
I would like to become part of your army”,
says Vibheeshana.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.170
Rama accepts the offer.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:14.279
So, talking about resilience, you also need
to reinforce, before trying once again.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:17.260
What is the sixth RE?

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.509
The sixth RE is REthink.

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:24.430
You have tried everything.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.660
Reinforce.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.889
Reframe.

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:28.120
Rework.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.350
Everything.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.089
But, nothing seems to be working.

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:39.100
In that case, you probably have to stop doing,
and start THINKING.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:46.880
That is what Rama does, when, repeatedly,
he chops off one head after the other, of

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880
Ravana.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.130
As he chops off, they seem to regrow.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.310
He doesn’t know what to do.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.590
He is on the verge of giving up.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.590
He takes pause, and starts wondering what
to do.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.370
I think that is when the Aditya Hridayam Stotram
is given to Rama.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:07.759
And, at that moment, Vibheeshana comes around
to tell Rama, “Dear Sire, he has a special

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:08.759
power source.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:09.759
A battery.

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:10.759
A spare battery.

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:14.730
An Amrita Nectar Pot in the navel region.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.080
That is where you need to point your arrow.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.600
That is his hidden power source.”

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:29.649
So, this rethinking.. stopping what you are
doing, wondering what else to do, is ALSO

00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:30.649
important.

00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:36.880
As a closing thought, I wondered if we could
take a nice and cute lesson from Physics.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.880
A philosophical lesson from the world of physics.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.980
We have encountered thermodynamics some time
at school.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980
Entropy.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:58.980
The most important lesson we learn there is,
if you drop a ball, this is how it will bounce….

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.459
Why?

00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:11.449
Because, air friction, heat transferred to
the ground, when bouncing molecules crashing

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:15.199
against each other, rubbing, friction, heat
again.

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:17.160
All of this, where does it come from?

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.780
This energy comes from the potential energy
locked up in the height of the bounce.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.199
And so, the reduction in height.

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:26.150
Which is why it cannot bounce back to the
same height.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:32.070
This is one of the unbreakable laws in thermodynamics.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.150
Which means, you cannot bounce a ball like
this!

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:46.060
Even if you bounce a so-called magic-ball,
it will start attenuating after a few bounces.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.950
While looking at this, I was wondering..

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:55.460
Hey, do you know what you need to do, to be
perfectly resilient?

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:01.240
Instead of dying out like the first ball,
if you want to continue resiliently like the

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.390
second ball?

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.470
Thermodynamics!

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.320
Friction..

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.539
Loss of heat.

00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:10.640
You know what you have to do?!

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.460
You have to KEEP YOUR COOL!

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:20.600
If only the ball decides, “I will remain
at the same temperature, I will not dissipate

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.370
heat to others..”, the ball can KEEP bouncing!

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.799
That’s it for today.

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:39.560
See you soon, on the 20th of Jan!
Thank you!
