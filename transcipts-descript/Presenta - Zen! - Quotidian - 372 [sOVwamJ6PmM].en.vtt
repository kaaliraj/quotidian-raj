00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:11.950
Do you remember this person? He appears in
the movie "Baahubali"

00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:36.530
What was he trying to say? He is wanting to convey something.
Even if we couldn't understand the language

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:46.720
AT ALL, somehow we were drawn into the story,
we were made to believe he was threatening

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:55.680
us, the setting, the story, the environment,
the dress, the body language,&nbsp;.. goes beyond

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.780
language.. This is enough for us, to convey
a story. The art of presentation.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.134
 That is the topic for today.&nbsp;

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:20.134
Intro music

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:29.459
Namaste! A book titled "Presentation Zen" caught my
eye. A book focused on the Art of Making Presentations.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:39.079
How to design them, how to plan them out,
how to deliver them, beautifully. Zen… In

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:50.450
the Japanese Buddhist style… A book by Garr
Reynolds. In this book, I liked many things

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.169
about it. But, what was extra special about
this book? Well, it refers to another book

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:05.039
inside it. That the world is changing.. That
there are two halves to the human brain. There

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:12.629
is a bias now towards the right side of the
brain. Yes.. the right-brain left-brain - people

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:20.099
have been discrediting it as a myth. But,
beyond that, to not just look at the logical

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.660
bits but also the holistic aspect of everything - is
important, says Daniel Pink, the author. And,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.069
these New Age people that Daniel Pink describes
in his book,&nbsp;… a New Age of Conceptualisation

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:45.489
from the Age of Information, if we are to
deliver presentations to these people, what

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.890
are the methods and approaches? That is what
the Presentation Zen book covers so amply.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.090
It gives a very detailed description about
how to approach it.&nbsp;

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.970
In the Whole New Mind book, the author talks
about six aspects - six important aspects

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:12.650
that comprise our thought process. And, so,
in the Presentation Zen book, the advice from

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.140
the author, Garr Reynolds, is that a presenter
has to look for ways to address these six

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.579
important aspects in their presentations.
What are those six aspects? Let us look at

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.640
them!
Number One is Design. It is not just the function.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.840
Not just whether it works. Design. The moment
you hear Design, you shouldn't start thinking

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.769
picture, color, paint. Which is why this quote
by Steve Jobs is so important. It is not about

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:49.670
what it looks like, what it feels like, it
is about how it works! The moment you think

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.450
you are designing something, if you recall
"color", "frame", "shape", "structure", "size",

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.049
probably you are not doing it right. While
talking about not doing something right, this

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:05.800
comes to mind. They said it was the best-designed
ship. The Titanic. We know what happened.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:13.810
They were giving more importance to the shiny
brass doorknobs probably, than to whether

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:24.290
will it float?! Design. We need to redefine
the meaning of the word "Design" itself. So,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:32.480
do not jump into choosing the typeface, the
font, the size, the color of your presentation,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:41.371
prepare the content first. Prepare the concept
first. Beat it around. And then, get to the

00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:48.880
brass tacks.&nbsp;
The second aspect is Story. If you go all

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.540
the back to the Cave Man, you wouldn't find
a classroom, you wouldn't find people reading

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.130
and writing. Even before all that, the first
communication started around storytelling.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.430
Do you know how large a lion I saw? Do you
know what a strong blow I dealt it then? The

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.461
storyteller goes on, and the others follow
his every word with rapt attention. Probably

00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:17.720
the world's first profession was Presenting!
Do you realise? He has even pulled it off

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.720
without any slides! So, it is not just argument,
coming up with your logical proposal, it is

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.350
also about an emotion-laden story. So, even
before starting to think about your presentation,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:38.270
ask yourself what story you are going to tell.
What are you going to do to motivate, inspire

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.940
and move us…?&nbsp;
Look at this picture, for example. Is there

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:53.050
a story? Can you create a murder story around
this? Can you create a happy family meal story

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:03.970
around this? Can you create a mystery around
this? Left to you. But, everything has a story

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:11.720
to tell. Let us not forget that!
The third aspect is Symphony. It is not only

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.120
about focusing on the bits and pieces, the
component parts, it is also about how they

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.370
all come together. How do we weave them? How
do we combine them, thread them, summarise

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.610
them, and present it as one unified whole?
The word symphony may remind you of this..

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:39.640
Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, perhaps. But go beyond
that. Yes, music is composed of the seven

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.280
notes. Sapta Swaras.&nbsp;
But, what about words? Every sentence anybody

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.120
ever wrote is composed of words. A million
words perhaps, in the English dictionary.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.320
Every word is composed of these 26 letters.
Nobody is going to invent a new one. So, it

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.070
is about putting the pieces together.&nbsp;
What about the periodic table? Any matter

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.520
you see anywhere in this universe, is probably
just made of 118 elements, they say.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.190
If we go even further down, probably neutron,
proton, electron, and if you divide them even

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:17.960
smaller, there is a quark, there is a lepton,
there is a hadron, there is a boson, component

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:25.790
pieces. Don't worry about the component pieces,
don't worry about inventing, discovering,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:33.530
coming up with something, postulating something
new… Look at the old stuff, connect them

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:40.550
interestingly, and present to us. People do
not come to an orchestra to listen to new

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:49.250
sounds… They come to listen to their old
friends, their old notes, composed and strung

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:55.210
together interestingly.&nbsp;
The next aspect the author talks about is

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:01.770
Empathy. Empathy basically means it is not
just about speaking, it is also about understanding

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:07.550
whether you are being heard! Empathy, in the
context of a presenter and an audience is,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:14.070
to understand from the audience's point of
view. This, incidentally, is Manikandan Vembu,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:22.280
the COO of Zoho Corporation. He had visited
Zoho Schools, where I work, and we had an

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:28.160
hour-long conversation with our students.
Time seemed to have stopped - the talk

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:35.340
was so engrossing. Towards the end, he launched
into a mini-lecture of sorts! I proposed to

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.140
him - if we could continue this for a
bit longer.. The students were interested

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:46.040
and engaged.. Immediately, he brought back
a memory from his school times. He said, I

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.880
have attended many such lectures myself. And,
sitting in the last bench, our only unasked

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:58.270
question would be, when will the man finish
talking! I know the student mindset! No talk

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.840
can last longer than an hour. However interesting
the person is. And, I know how I have been

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:15.190
doing. He demonstrated that humility (of course)
and self-knowledge. A great example of empathy.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:22.520
This is in short supply today. Most presenters.
Most communicators… forget about the most

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:29.350
important aspect of listening for feedback.
While performing, are they listening, are

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:37.940
they engaging, are they resonating, is something
that is very important to observe and know.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.180
The fifth aspect is Play. Again.., Corporate?
Official? Business? We immediately tell ourselves,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:56.120
no way, we can't mix it with pleasure, fun,
play. What you are seeing is a TED Talk. A

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:07.700
TED TALK! This guy, a scientist, his name
is Clifford Stoll, see what he does. See what ALL he does.&nbsp;

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.000
Anybody seen a slide? Written on the palm?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.700
Animated. Excited. Nervous Energy!

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:10.600
 The guy sitting behind is Anderson himself. The guy
who created TED for us all. What's wrong with

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:18.370
this?! So, let your hair down. When you present,
if you are too serious all the time, you give

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:23.860
the impression that you know everything. That
you have figured out everything. Let us all

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.230
agree that there are things that cannot be
figured out. There are things you cannot break

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:38.050
your head at any more. Humour. Fun. Tongue-in-cheek.
Is a great escape valve. Use that.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:49.500
And, finally, Meaning. Every one of us, we
are in the quest for something. We are searching

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:57.800
for something. Could be, Reason for existence.
Could be Solutions. Could be New Approaches.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:07.170
Could be, an Audience for a philosophy or
a concept we have come up with. Most important

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:13.570
thing here is… it is not just accumulating
whatever we encounter, it is about putting

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:22.730
them together and seeing meaning. We are standing
like this… Actually though, we are standing

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:31.690
like THIS. In this darkness, in this ocean,
where we are probably just a nobody, a light

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:40.930
in my hand too, let me also shine mine too..
You respect me as an individual, all of you

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:47.589
are here. Here is something that I want to
put forward. Please take it, and check if

00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:54.490
that helps you in your quest for meaning.
That is how we should finalise this.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.720
So, these are the six aspects in The Whole
New Mind, and Garr Reynolds of Presentation

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:10.380
Zen tells us to keep these in mind when going
about building our presentations.&nbsp;

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:18.820
But, I want to share a closing thought here,
could be a negative thought. The point is,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:25.530
I felt he stabbed me in the back. Look at
the cover for the book. Presentation Zen 3.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:34.200
He has even mentioned it in an interview.
It is simple. Look at the cover. Simple. Doesn't

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:40.050
even say Third Edition. Just Three. Isn't
that a mistake? What would we immediately

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.760
think? When we see Three? We would be misled
into looking for One and Two. Yes? Because

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:51.961
we would assume this is the Third Volume.
Am I wrong? So, make things simple. But, don't

00:13:51.961 --> 00:14:01.060
oversimplify, and end up confusing me. I felt
stabbed in the back. I don't know about you.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.820
Three! Thank you!
