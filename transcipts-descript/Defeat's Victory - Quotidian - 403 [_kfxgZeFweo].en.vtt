00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.399
There is this NBA thing! National Basketball
Association… The world’s, probably the

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:14.710
world’s greatest display of basketball skill
and artistry… In that NBA, I came across

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.480
an interesting bit of statistics. You can
check out the URL up above too. Most MISSED

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.900
SHOTS in NBA history. You attempt a shot.
But, you miss it, the ball doesn’t go through

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.560
the ring and the net. That’s a missed shot.
Who holds the record for the maximum of those?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:40.500
A record like that!! I have erased that person’s
body so I can give you time to guess who that

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.920
would be.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:52.690
But, totally shocking! It is actually Kobe
Bryant! One of the greatest of the greats!

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.060
When Michael Jordan is close to retirement,
Kobe plays a game with him, and he is hailed

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:06.890
as the Next Michael Jordan… Who, by the
way the Greatest of the Greats! And, Kobe

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.070
Bryant has broken so many more records than
Michael. This record though, is for the maximum

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:35.070
number of shots missed. There is a message
there for us… Do you recognise what it is?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:53.380
Namaste! Yesterday, we saw the Defeat of Victory.
Today, we are going to see the converse. The

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.659
Victory of Defeat. The same book. The Winning
Way. A Chapter on Defeat.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.890
First, let us look at this quote from J K
Rowling. About Defeat. “You might never

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:19.370
fail on the scale I did, but some failure
in life is inevitable. It is impossible to

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.030
live without failing at something, unless
you live so cautiously that you might as well

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:37.060
not have lived at all — in which case, you
fail by default.” Such a beautiful call

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.610
to action, I would think.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.209
The West Indies Team of the 80s. We talked
about the amazing world-famous victory for

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:01.049
India in the 1983 World Cup, over the West
Indies. This is the team that lost to us.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:08.870
But, what happened after that? Do you know?!
It was almost as if we had awakened a sleeping

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.739
giant! We gave West Indies the spirit to win!

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:24.299
Just look at these numbers. Immediately after
the World Cup win by India against the West

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:35.300
Indies, we toured the West Indies. We lost
5–0. One Days. And, after that 5–0 blackwash,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.870
do you have any idea how long India had to
wait for a win against the West Indies? All

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:53.790
over the world? They had to wait five years!
To get a single win! And, that win? A solitary

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.019
win in a 6–1 drubbing by the West Indies
who toured India! Once again! Who were they?

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:06.349
Clive Lloyd! Vivian Richards! Malcolm Marshall!
Gordon Greenidge! Giants! Stalwarts! So, sometimes,

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:14.329
a defeat is actually useful. Early on. Before
the stakes are too high. Because, it wakes

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.730
you up, and tells you that you can’t underestimate
the opposition, you can’t take anything

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.730
for granted, everyday you start from zero…
If you are looking for golden lessons like

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.850
these, an occasional loss is actually GOOD!

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:41.990
This person here is Pat Riley. He is considered
one of the greatest coaches in NBA history.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:51.800
He has coached the Miami Heat. And the Los
Angeles Lakers. He, I think, has the maximum

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.010
number of Championship Rings. He has won as
a Player. As an Assistant Coach. As a Head

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.070
Coach. As an Owner. As an Executive. He has
written this book called The Winning Within.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.790
He talks about something very special. He
says, “The Defeat of Us…comes, sometimes,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:19.120
from this Disease of Me!”. Find out if you
are afflicted by this Disease of Me. Have

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:28.170
you lost? Are you planning to analyse? Well,
look for the Disease of Me first!

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:36.910
So, what is this Disease of Me? He gives these
Seven Deadly Sins. He asks you to look for

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.840
these seven problems! Inexperience with success.
Can you bear the crown of victory” lightly

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.130
on your head? The burden of success that we
saw yesterday. If you see somebody struggle

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.310
because of inexperience there, Problem! Is
there somebody moping in a corner, often,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.010
feeling that nobody appreciates him enough
for his contributions? That is a Problem!

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.990
Is somebody feeling that they are always getting
“cheated out”? That they MAY GET cheated

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.410
that? That they WILL NOT get the opportunity
that they deserve? Are there people like that

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.430
in your team? Problem! Is somebody upset and
having a heartburn because somebody else in

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.620
the same team is doing something exceptional??
When you are in a team, you should be HAPPY

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.040
that you are among top performers! If you
are unhappy, if you are feeling resentment,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.000
that somebody else in your team is doing well,
Problem! Is a team member’s personal effort

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.720
geared towards bettering the opposition? Or,
is it aimed at outshining somebody else within

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:54.480
the team?! Problem! Are there rivalries internally?
It 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:01.530
is not the India-Pakistan rivalry! It is among
Pakistani players. It is among Indian players.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:07.100
Who will be higher in the batting order? Who
will bowl the last over? If he is batting,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.720
I won’t go as the second runner… This
sort of rivalry! Big problem. The team will

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.040
be decimated! And, finally, even if the team
actually wins, even if the team member has

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.310
actually won, are they filled with frustration,
just because they couldn’t do their best,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.050
they didn’t contribute to that win, … are
they frustrated? Among these seven sins, even

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:39.780
if you have committed just one of these, even
if just one of these has infected your team,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:49.000
please get in and fix it fast! The seven deadly
sins..! The Disease of Me that leads to the

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.370
Defeat of Us!

00:07:50.370 --> 00:08:00.010
You must surely know this guy. Sachin Tendulkar.
He seems slightly upset. I am sure you know

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:07.080
this person too. Michael Jordan. He seems
deep in thought.. Upset. The reason I picked

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:14.280
these “mood out” pictures is… Harsha
Bhogle says in that book — both of these

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:24.640
players had a specific problem! Their problem
was — They wanted to win it for the team.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.030
They assumed they HAD to win it for their
team. A motivation. A drive. Good. But, what

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:42.990
is the bad side? The other side of the coin?
Everybody else in the team assumed these two

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:51.270
would win it for their team! That is the problem!
If you have a superduper star in your team,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:58.030
this is a problem you need to fix. Because,
they will all assume that the superstar will

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:05.310
win it for us. Why..! Haven’t we seen this
in our Superstar movies too? Too often, we

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:12.720
think, just because we have that Superstar
in our movie, the movie will be carried forward!

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.930
Businesses.. companies.. you can notice the
same story playing out.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:26.280
Success.. Failure.. They aren’t a black
and white, clear distinction. There is a beautiful

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:33.840
bell curve of activity. Yes… there is SUCCESS
in one end of the scale. The winners. Very

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.521
few. But, you find them there. FAILURE is
on the other end of the spectrum. Yes. That

00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:50.200
is failure. But, there is a lot in between!
That grey area.. We aren’t respecting it

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.620
enough, says Harsha Bhogle.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:10:00.070
What are those grey areas? There are two areas.
One, before the peak of the curve, is the

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:07.150
place where we realise we could have done
better. We could have put in some more effort.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:13.070
I am capable of better. That is the first
grey area. And then, there is this second

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:20.030
area where you have already put in one hundred
percent of effort, but because of reasons

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:29.110
beyond your control… numerous reasons you
have no control over… lead to you not winning,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.920
you not succeeding, that day.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:41.440
In the 80s and the 90s, there was this German
lady. They called her Fraulein Forehand. Steffi

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.550
Graf. You must have heard of the name. Simply
amazing! She has won SO MANY Grand Slams.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:55.030
She hold the record for the maximum number
of weeks at Number One position in the ATP

00:10:55.030 --> 00:11:04.320
rankings. But, she had a problem. Her problem
was,… her backhand? Was always a sliced

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.120
backhand. The two-handed forced backhand,
she was never able to really execute it well.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:17.690
Sliced backhand. But, you know what she did?
She focused on her strengths. What was her

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:24.990
strength? That was her MONSTROUS forehand.
Very powerful. That’s why she was called

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:31.530
Fraulein Forehand. In that book, Harsha Bhogle
says, … this is a lesson we have seen earlier

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:39.500
too. Focus on your strengths. Ignore your
weaknesses. It is okay! The way he puts it

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:59.070
is… “Do not let what you CAN’T DO interfere
with what you CAN DO!” How beautiful!

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:05.390
As a closing thought, I want to share an interesting
quote I found in that book. This is Jack Welch.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:12.430
The CEO of GE, once upon a time. Famous as
a super-powerful, turn-around CEO! He has

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:18.590
commented on something truly timeless. True
then. True today. True forever too, I would

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:31.510
think. He says, “If the rate of change on
the outside 

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:42.020
exceeds the rate of change on the inside,
I am sorry, the end is near”! How beautiful!

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:57.780
We have reached the end of THIS video. See
you again, on the Sixth of July! Thank you!
