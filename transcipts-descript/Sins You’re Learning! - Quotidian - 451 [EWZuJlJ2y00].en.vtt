00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.330
No!

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.480
Don’t do it!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.000
It is a sin!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.360
Many religions have listed quite a few acts
as sinful, taboo, to be avoided at all costs.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.460
If, for example, you take Hinduism, there
are some SIX sins.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.320
You should never indulge in these six CARDINAL
sins.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.990
If you take Buddhism, there are TEN.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.169
If you consider Islam,..

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.559
I saw multiple sources.. one of them said
FIFTEEN.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.980
And, Christianity talks about SEVEN deadly
sins.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.670
There is a lot of commonality among these.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.780
Let us pick these Seven Deadly Sins in Christianity..

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.980
And look at it from the point of view of a
student.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.670
Let us give it a “counter-take”!

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.320
Namaste!

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.550
Four Hundred and Fifty One!

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.840
Paavangalai Kal..

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:30.250
Some religions dictate that if you stoop low
enough to perform these sinful acts, the immediate

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.159
punishment waiting for you is to be pelted
by stones!

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.740
But, no, that is not what we are going to
look at.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.420
In Christianity, there are Seven Deadly Sins.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.670
We are going to look at them one by one.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:57.280
And, as we do that, we are going to take the
vantage point of a student, a learner.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.399
And, ask ourselves..

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.079
From their viewpoint too, is it really a sin?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.570
Or, is there a hidden layer there?

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.140
A new way to look at this old concept?

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.610
That is what we are going to see.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.290
The first is Pride.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.190
We are told that one should not indulge in
vanity.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.190
Self-praise.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.670
From one viewpoint, yes, it is wrong to do
that…

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.520
But, I want to dig deeper.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.099
When we think about it a bit more, I am reminded
of the story of Bhasmasura.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.670
So, what’s the Bhasmasura story?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.000
Well, Lord Shiva, thrilled by the Asura’s
disciplined penance, blessed him with a boon.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.800
Placing your hand on the head of anybody…
is all you need to burn them to ashes!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.909
They would be destroyed!

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:48.909
Turned to ashes!

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:56.400
Bhasmasura will try it, .. it will seem to
work, and.. hubris will make him want to try

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.550
it on Lord Shiva himself!

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.230
Lord Shiva runs…!

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.230
To Lord Vishnu.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.940
And he employs a shady trick to solve the
problem..

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:17.120
But, the point is, creating something that
threatens to destroy you.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.050
That is not an easy thing to do!

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.280
That requires one amazing ability..

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.900
If you don’t have a critical amount of capability,
power, and creative ability, I don’t think

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.400
it is easy to be able to create something
that threatens to destroy its very Maker!

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.079
Man has been able to do it!

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:50.129
He learned about the power inside 
the atom.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.400
He kept fiddling with it.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.409
For nearly forty years.

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.319
He saw everything that was inside it.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.550
And then, he discovered that it has got limitless
energy.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.910
And then, he changed it into a weapon..

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.299
And then, for a very long time he has been
threatened by that weapon.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.129
The same thing happened in the world of programming.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.019
They created a computer.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.060
They kept adding the power and capability
of that thing.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.480
And today, we have birthed a beast called
ChatGPT.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.650
And nobody knows what is going to hit us tomorrow.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.610
It is threatening..

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.660
you know whose jobs are going first?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.380
Guess?

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.500
The computer programmer is losing their job.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.971
Because, writing code is probably the easiest
thing that an AI program can do.

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:48.100
And, I think one has to be PROUD about this.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.100
Justified pride.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.660
As a learner, as a student, as a pursuer of
knowledge, you are allowed to be proud.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.780
Because..

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.300
You have created something that threatens
your own existence!

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.380
Go ahead!

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.000
Be proud!

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.620
The second thing they warn us about is Greed.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.190
I want it.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.770
I need it.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.460
And, it should be ONLY FOR ME!

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.180
I haven’t spoken about this to anybody else
till now.. but I am going to leak it out to

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.180
you..

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.180
When I was at college, there was this one
particular book..

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.180
Extra-special.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.780
The concepts that would be appearing in the
exam would have been so beautifully described

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.819
in the book.

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.250
The book was unusually costly.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.660
There were only two copies of the book..

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.180
One of them was with the professor, and the
other was in the general library.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.030
Guess what I did?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.930
Not only did I borrow the book from the general
library… which is not a crime to do after

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.630
all.. but, without stopping there, I read
it and while returning it, I displaced it..

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.090
I placed it somewhere else!

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.090
That greed..

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.110
That only I should have access to that book.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.760
That I could borrow it any time I wanted to.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.009
What a heinous crime!

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.840
Yes, Greed is a sin.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.340
On the other hand, today, with electronic
books and the internet, and Google helping

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.830
us as an amazing indexing engine that goes
to every nook and corner of the internet,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.819
sorry, you can’t hoard information.

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:44.860
Good information, bad information, all kinds
of gossip and rumour, truths, opinions, will

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.720
always be available to everybody.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:59.370
So, a student is, I think, protected and vaccinated
from the evil influence of the Sin of Greed.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.340
They are immune to it.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.280
You cannot be Greedy.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.400
If something is good, there will be six other
people having a copy of that good thing.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.160
Don’t worry!

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.610
The third is Lust.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:22.320
A.. a sexual desire, they would say..

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:33.460
But, if you peel some layers off and look
at it in depth, it is more of an innate urge

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.729
to make copies of yourself.

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:37.889
Reproducing urge.

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.539
They keep talking about a “gene”..

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:46.550
But, Richard Dawkins, a famous scientist and
popular author, talks about something that

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.009
can spread even faster than a gene!

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:52.169
And, don’t confuse it with a Vadivel meme,
please.

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:56.169
A meme is the germ of an idea.

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:09.310
If the idea possesses a sense of virality,
it will spread and make you forever famous.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:29.150
There was this guy, Copernicus.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:41.060
It’s so clear!

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:50.660
That.. to make the human being and Earth the
center of the Universe, the planets had to

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.370
do all kinds of loopy, messy circuits.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.140
If you could just internalise that single
truth — that “You are not the center of

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:04.100
the universe” — if we could replace the
Earth with the Sun in the center, everything

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.910
clicks into place so beautifully!

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:11.260
That was the realisation Copernicus arrived
at… sixty years before Galileo invented

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.980
and made the telescope popular!

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.720
He had a meme!

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.100
He said “Heliocentric”..

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.230
And, he didn’t just write about it and keep
quiet.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.459
He went talking.

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:26.950
He spoke at the Church.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.940
He harangued the Pope.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.930
He advised his students.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.339
You need to have Lust.

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:46.390
You need to want your idea to be sown and
watered in the minds of every person you come

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.740
in contact with!

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.740
Go!

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.740
Be lustful!

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.740
Envy is .. another sin.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.589
“Oh, .. it is so beautiful!

00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:58.399
Oh .. this person is simply amazing!”

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:01.610
That admiration..

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.310
becomes envy when we start comparing.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.649
“How beautiful..

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:10.019
I am not that pretty…”

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:11.370
“How fast..

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.740
I am not that speedy”..

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.930
When you start doing that, admiration becomes
envy.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:24.200
And, envy is to be abhorred, everybody says.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:31.720
On the other hand, if you channelise that
envy..

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.830
This person is envious of that other person..

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.769
How did you alone manage to get up there?

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:41.260
What was the path you followed?

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.820
Who helped you along the way?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.149
How did you pull it off?

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:48.309
What did you focus on?

00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:49.660
What did you sacrifice?

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:57.610
If I start understanding and analysing, in
an attempt to reach there myself, … That

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.630
sort of envy?

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.660
Is actually good.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.860
You can be envious.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.420
Nothing wrong!

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.420
Then comes Gluttony.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.290
Gluttony is insatiable hunger.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.370
A limitless, an uncontrollable, desire to
stuff.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:31.480
With no rhyme or reason, with no hunger, .. you
continue to eat.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:37.899
With no realisation or need, with no understanding
that this that I am eating now is going to

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:39.420
help me for that..

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.350
No sense of connectivity..

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.110
You continue gathering stuff…

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.420
Stuffing it into your mouth.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.230
And, the elders warn us against this sin.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.380
You know what ChatGPT is?

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.120
It is a model.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:09.350
It is a natural-language responding engine
that has been trained on probably ten billion

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.090
unique points of data.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.090
They could be truth-statements.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.910
They could be opinions.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.959
They could be conversations.

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:23.709
But, ChatGPT excelled in gluttony.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:36.209
With no real dotted line connecting each item
to a future point where that would be useful,

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:47.610
… realising that we may never walk this
path again, whatever nuggets it saw on the

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.589
way, it told to itself “who knows when they
would be useful, let me grab!”

00:12:53.589 --> 00:13:04.420
A student, today, if you have to defeat the
likes of ChatGPT, you need to indulge in Gluttony.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:11.720
Some of the things you learn, you may not
be able to understand the reasoning, the rationale,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.400
until later.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:21.399
Some of the things you learn may seem unconnected,
but down the line, you may see the connections.

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:28.120
So, today, your task, is to indulge in Gluttony.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.170
Collect information.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.230
Collect experiences.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.230
Sift them.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.320
Analyse them.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.700
Remix them.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.200
Create your own.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.870
Share them.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.870
Combine.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.870
Recombine.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:50.980
So, indulging in Gluttony, .. for a student,
for a lifelong learner, .. can’t be seen

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.089
as a Sin!

00:13:54.089 --> 00:13:56.509
Wrath!

00:13:56.509 --> 00:14:02.589
Wrath is.. extreme anger.

00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:04.240
Uncontrollable anger.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.330
And, specifically, justified anger.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.630
Bharathiyaar used to call it “Rowthiram”.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:26.940
That anger comes from your inability to keep
calm and passive when you look around at all

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.550
the injustice happening around you!

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:36.850
You bubble and explode like a volcano!

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.680
The injustices around me, I can’t keep quiet.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.270
I can’t stomach this..

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.350
That is Rowthiram.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.639
For a student, Rowthiram is important.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:53.709
Particularly, self-directed Rowthiram.

00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:56.759
You need to be angry at yourself.

00:14:56.759 --> 00:15:04.720
You need to be angry for all the submissions
you do to the distractions for your time..

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.930
How many distractions!

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.130
How many give-ins?

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.339
How many surrenders?

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:14.220
You should be angry!

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.029
Succeeding is not in your hands!

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:20.759
But, excelling?

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:23.220
Becoming the best is not in your hands.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.720
But, giving your best is in your hands.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:37.649
If you ended up not putting in your best,
.. you need Rowthiram to show you the right

00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:38.649
path.

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:40.190
There used to be this place called Cheetthalai..

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.040
Famous for a poet who was born there.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.040
A chaatthanaar.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.040
Cheetthalai Chaatthanaar.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.790
My dad used to spin me a yarn, but, unfortunately,
try as I might, I haven’t been able to find

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.190
references for its veracity on the internet
since then.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.360
But, the story was interesting to listen to,
at that time.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.950
Chaatthanaar would use his “writing awl”
on palm leaves.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:03.310
And, if an error cropped up, a missing rhythm
or rhyme, or an asymmetric meter, .. he would

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.470
punish himself by poking his head with the
awl.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.150
And, why was he named Cheetthalai?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.160
Well, so often did he correct himself that
the skin in his head got septic!

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.160
Cheetthalai Chatthanaar.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160
Nice story.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160
I love it.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160
Even though it is not true!

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:30.149
Because, the student who knows to self-flagellate..
the student who stands in front of the mirror

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:31.389
and corrects themselves..

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:36.660
When the person in the mirror tells them — “You
didn’t do your best.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.940
You didn’t put in your hundred percent..”
and you can acknowledge it, I think that is

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.779
a great quality for a lifelong learner.

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:51.069
The seventh is Sloth.

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:53.180
Lethargy.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.290
Inactivity.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.399
Reactionless…

00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:10.670
It is wrong, we are advised, to sit around
doing nothing.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.670
Again..

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:16.390
On the contrary, I am going to tell you that
Sloth is perhaps useful..

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.439
We have all grown up hearing the pointed messages
about the fabled early bird that gets the

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:21.439
worm..

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:22.439
The second bird?

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:23.439
Sorry.

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:24.439
No luck.

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:26.370
The first bird got it.

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:32.049
That is how we were grown up, by our parents.

00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:37.010
But, do you know what is the real game today?

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:43.010
The real game is not up in the skies, but
in the corner of the room..

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:48.780
Where the old mouse is giving advice to the
young mice..

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.780
“Hello!

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.270
It is the second mouse that gets the cheese!

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.390
The first one is caught..

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.150
The trap can’t work any longer..

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.220
The cheese is still around.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.130
It is the second mouse, hence, that gets the
cheese.”

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.049
Remember this famous book?

00:18:08.049 --> 00:18:09.049
Thinking Fast and Slow?

00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:11.570
We have encountered the concept of System
1 and System 2 thinking.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.290
Slow down!

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.669
Allow the System 2 to take over and give you
better advice.

00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:20.340
The author entreats us..

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.640
Daniel Kahneman.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.390
“Nothing in life is as important as you
think it is, while you are thinking about

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.390
it.”

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.309
So, stop thinking about it!

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:33.549
Put it on HOLD!

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:34.549
Let us address it tomorrow!

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:37.059
You will get a better idea tomorrow!

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:40.510
You will be able to make better decisions
tomorrow.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.770
Delay.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.530
Slow down.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.530
Be Slothful!

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.530
So…

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.790
I am not asking you to commit sins!

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.580
All I am saying is, those sins?

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.770
They didn’t sin!

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.770
You can use them redeemingly!

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.370
Look at them from a different viewpoint.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.409
As a closing thought, I want to refer to this
amazing book — The Kite Runner.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:03.760
By Khaled Hosseini.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.900
A little boy speaks with his father.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.460
And his father is advising him.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.429
“You are going to the school.

00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:19.360
And, the religious teacher, the Mullah, will
be advising you.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.850
But, remember this one thing.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:29.380
There is only one sin, and that is theft.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.610
Every other sin is a variation of theft”.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.559
The boy is flummoxed.

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:39.309
The dad elaborates:- “If you are going to
kill somebody, you are STEALING their life.

00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:45.400
If you are going to have a relationship with
the wife of some other man, you are STEALING

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.430
that woman’s children’s right to a father.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:59.309
If you are going to lie to somebody, you are
STEALING that listener’s right to the truth.

00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:06.750
If you are going to cheat somebody, you are
STEALING that person’s right to fairness.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.440
How beautiful, is it not?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.409
There is only one sin, and that is Theft.

00:20:13.409 --> 00:20:16.289
Don’t steal, he says!

00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:18.450
Food for thought.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:24.010
We will meet again soon.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:31.030
Thank you!
