00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.400
Namaste!

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.180
We have already encountered the story of The
Jungle Book.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.309
A book authored by Sir Rudyard Kipling.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.690
There is a scene like this in that movie.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.890
In the original movie, the animated version
from Disney.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.880
Baloo the Bear would ask for Mowgli’s help.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.810
Scratch my back please, it would ask…

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.067
The boy is not doing too good a job...

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:46.680
Realising that it is not going to be enough,

00:00:51.667 --> 00:01:04.379
Baloo uses a tree… That isn’t good enough, so he uproots the
tree!

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:21.600
And, finally, when all is done, that is when
he rests!

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.950
So, according to me, if you want to really
build something new, if you want to get into

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.467
a market, one of the most frequently given
pieces of advice is:- “Scratch your own itch!”

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.130
The problem that YOU want to get a solution,
forget about the others, think about YOURSELF.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.130
Personal need.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.660
Try and fulfil that, they would say.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.229
I wondered why they say this — and arrived
at three possible reasons.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.990
The first one is, “Nobody else is going
to solve it for you”.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.920
Even asking somebody to scratch your back
sounds odd and inappropriate..!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.139
And, why would he do that?

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.390
Why would she do that?

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.290
You have to scratch your own itch!

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.150
Point number one!

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.150
The second?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.209
Well, “You would do ANYTHING to solve it!”

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.999
I had an aunt, who would take a knife to her
back!

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.639
Unable to reach all the way with her hand,
she would use a KNIFE!

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.659
We would be afraid that she might BLEED!

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.659
That serious!

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.700
Because, that was how bad the itch she had
was!

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.659
If you remember the Three Idiots movie, there
is a scene…

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.659
well, wait..

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.480
I don’t want to recall that moment now!

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.290
And, finally, the third reason it works for
you is, “You won’t STOP until it is solved”.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.639
If it is for money, if it is for marks, if
it is for a project, if it is for a degree,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.170
you would stop when that is done, not when
the PROJECT is done!

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.680
But, when the project is for you, when you
are scratching a personal itch, you will continue

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.519
to do it past all other demands from outside.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.849
And stop ONLY when that work is finished,
and that itch is gone.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.889
There are many examples…

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.720
The Virgin Airlines group itself was born
when…

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.029
Richard Branson.. the one seated far left,
he was stranded in an island, he had to go

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:31.050
to the mainland, the flight was cancelled,
so, what did he do?

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.980
He went out, he chartered a plane, sold tickets
among the others, and that was Flight Number

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.209
One.. the story goes.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.909
Scratching a personal itch!

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.489
Consider the Linux operating system.

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.549
Torvalds wanted, Linus Torvalds wanted a printer
driver, nobody had written it, he wrote it,

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.389
he put it up, and it became popular, and Linux
was born!

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.459
Scratching a personal itch!

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.459
How about Facebook?

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.269
Did you really think Zuckerberg’s oh-so-noble
intention was to connect all the people in

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.269
all the world??

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.359
He wanted to write a game that would help
him keep track of which girl in the hostel

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.499
opposite to where he lived was hot, and which
one was not!

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.420
It was the near-futile attempt to hook a girlfriend.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.500
That was Facebook!

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.620
AirBnB — wherever you turn, there seem to
be rooms available for a low cost because

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.800
of this startup…

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.690
Once upon a time, two college students, unable
to pay the rent for their accommodation, and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.740
at the same time, there is a shortage of hotel
rooms in the town because of an art exhibition

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.340
event happening around that time, and they
sub-rent their rental space.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:49.710
Their own room, with an air-bed and breakfast
— that was how it got started!

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.140
That was AirBnB.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.409
But, hang on.

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.030
Let me give you a small warning too!

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.500
Don’t overdo it!

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.229
If there were a dense jungle, and you were
the first person to go through it, … it

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.750
would be very difficult to make a path.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.379
But, the person who is following behind you,
… when he follows the path you took, if

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.099
he adopts the Fast Follow Pattern, he may
even be able to overtake.

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.430
So, in your attempt to scratch an itch, in
your attempt to find a solution that nobody

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:32.690
has found yet, don’t make it too easy for
anybody to follow you.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.449
That is the primary warning.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.319
The second problem?

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:42.979
If you end up liking the problem too much,
you will think..

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:51.500
you will bring it too close to your eyes,
and you will think the whole world has that

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.500
problem.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.500
It is NOT true.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.289
If you bring a small thing close enough to
your eyes, it may cover your whole scope of

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.949
vision, but that does not mean it is looming
large, world-size!

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.810
So, it could be just that only ten, fifteen,
people in the whole world has your problem.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.810
Then?

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.050
Can we monetise that problem?

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.759
Can we do business with that solution?

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:18.729
So, do enough number of people search for
a solution to that problem?

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.930
Are they ready to pay for it?

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.139
We need to consider those too!

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.139
Go ahead!

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.539
What’s the itch that you are going to scratch?!
