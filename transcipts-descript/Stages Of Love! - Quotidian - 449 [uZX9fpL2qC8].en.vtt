00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.899
Happy Valentine’s Day!

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.590
A movie by name “Uyire” hit the theaters
in 1998.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.860
By auteur Mani Ratnam.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.359
There is a famous song in that movie… they
even call it the Title Song, which talks about

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.080
the Seven Stages of Love.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:32.610
From seeing, to touching, through lust, to
love, all the way to the seventh stage…

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.230
pretty disastrous stage, that one.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.020
I don’t want to spoil the ending for you,
watch it, at least watch this song..

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.829
Beautifully orchestrated and choreographed..!

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.309
What are the Seven Stages of Love?

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.810
Is there a lesson for us hiding there?

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.950
That is the topic of our talk today.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:08.990
And yes, Happy Valentine’s Day!

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.720
Namaste!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.080
Four hundred and forty nine is about the stages
of love!

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.900
I had told you about Seven Stages.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.720
The movie refers to the seven too.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.400
During my online research too, there was something
about the number seven that kept coming back..

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.400
Seven Stages.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400
Seven Stages.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.400
What are those stages?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.009
That is what we are going to see.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.040
And, while looking at those seven stages,
I am not just going to restrict myself to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.430
the Seven Stages in this relationship — man
and woman, husband and wife.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.430
No.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:59.701
I am also going to extend it, see if I can
draw some parallels and analogies, to this

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.079
relationship.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.860
A person and a company.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.459
For, somehow it strikes me, .. in many many
ways.. they even say “You are married to

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.459
the job!”

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.860
.. in many many ways, there are more similarities
here than we think!

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.070
In my case, I want married in 1998.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.989
And, I got my first break, my real solid job
in ‘98.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:40.000
So, when I look back at the 25 years that
have gone by, I see a lot of learnings that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.019
I can get from one and apply to the other.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.580
Come on, let us dive in!

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:55.560
These Seven Stages… they are not like…
you have to pass through each of them..

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.180
You have to spend these many years in each
of them..

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.650
No, nothing like that.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.129
These Seven Stages — you can even frogjump
some stages..

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.620
Sometimes, you drop down to the previous stage..

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.560
It is a cycle, that gets progressively better…

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.840
That is how we should see it..

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.379
The first stage, of course, is The Honeymoon
Stage.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.060
In this honeymoon phase, Passion drives everything.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.739
You like them soooo much!

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.040
Your partner.. or in the other case, the company
you are an employee in.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.290
You are head over heels in love..

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.390
They can do nothing wrong.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.349
Nothing that they have done can ever be wrong!

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.810
In fact, you start loving their quirks…!

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.620
They will screw something up mightily, and
you will be at awe!

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.880
“How beautifully are they screwing up!

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880
So endearing!!”

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.700
Holds true with the company too!

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.700
You will love the quirks of your company!

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.330
In fact, .. remember the company called Zoho?!

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.720
There are many who have fallen just for the
logo..

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.720
Colorful..

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.720
Playful..

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.720
Casually arranged boxes..

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720
Oh so cute!

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.860
I know so many of those!

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:26.910
So, in this phase, the foundation for intimacy,
the foundation for closeness, the foundation

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.870
for trust is laid.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.000
To call this childish, to call this an infatuation,
to advise against this, to advise that this

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.870
be avoided, is missing the whole point.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.530
This is a great phase where you look forward
to greater things happening.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.520
You can’t stay here forever.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.810
You shouldn’t stay here forever.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.509
Which is why they call it the Honeymoon Phase.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.039
You have to come out of it.

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.940
But, this is a great phase that lays the platform
for future phases.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.190
The Honeymoon Phase.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:14.970
In just a few days past the Honeymoon Phase,
or a few weeks, or a few months, or a few

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.280
YEARS later, you arrive at the Realisation
Phase.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.729
In this Realisation Phase, the grim reality
of it all sets in.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.210
You start seeing warts..

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.210
Problems.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.210
Irritations.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.210
Troubles.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.210
Mosquito bites.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.210
Irregularities.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.210
Imperfections.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.210
Flaws.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.210
You were blind to all these all along.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.680
Your husband smokes and doesn’t even clear
the ashtray.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.310
You leave the toilet flap up.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.289
You don’t lock the door at night.

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.289
Messy.

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.910
This is the reality, but that reality is messy.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:04.951
It can attack you gradually, or suddenly,
one fine morning, one Sunday afternoon, it

00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:06.410
can hit you.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.010
This is the Realisation Phase.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:15.910
This Realisation is all about, this is what
they really are.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.449
What you saw was the Trailer.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.669
If you are the type who gets carried away
by the trailer, we can’t help you with that!

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.229
That Realisation Phase.

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:30.000
This is also a place where some disappointment,
some bitterness, some misunderstanding, some

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.800
conflict, the seeds of such discontent may
get sown.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:43.120
The best advice both marriage counsellors
and career counsellors give is, “Open up

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.290
to your partners.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.930
Open up to your colleagues.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.930
To your manager.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.050
To your HR.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.330
To your company.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.860
Share your thoughts freely.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.729
Be assertive without being disrespectful.

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:01.840
No need to be disrespectful, but no need to
shut up and remain silent either.”

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:09.030
An important advice in this phase, this Realisation
Phase.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.280
The third phase is the Rebellion phase.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.979
I am perfect.

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:16.970
I deserve much more.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:29.319
I can’t restrict myself to this shitty lifestyle,
shitty partnership I have been put into.

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.129
Sorry!

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.979
This is that sort of phase.

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:38.310
Differences, small differences, start magnifying.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.870
And, at this time, small problems don’t
seem to go away.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.350
They refuse to go away..

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:51.569
You don’t have the mindset to say, “It
is a small problem after all, let us grind

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:52.569
through it”..

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:57.360
Nor does the person on the other side have
the mindset where they can say, “They seem

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.330
to be bothered about it..

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.280
Why don’t we change this little matter from
now on?”

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.520
And, they make that classic mistake of trying
to change the other person..

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.050
Instead of looking inwards and introspecting,
their thoughts are all about “Can I change

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.729
the company” and the company thinks, “Can
I change this employee”.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:17.729
Both?

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.690
They lead to disaster.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:31.430
This problem, this Rebellion problem, if allowed
to grow uncontrolled for too long, we hear

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.450
about the infamous phrase, “The Seven Year
Itch”.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.310
The boy or the girl runs away..

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.219
The employee puts in their papers.

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:42.219
Worse!

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:45.970
They don’t run away..

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.180
They stay and cheat!

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.440
We see that in relationships.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.790
We see that in our work environment too.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.910
Can I take a side-gig..?

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:08.690
Stationed inside, unconsciously, I start plotting
the downfall of the company I am in.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.690
Dangerous!

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:15.290
That is why it is called The Rebellion.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.490
A mutinous phase.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.029
Number Four is the Reassessment Phase.

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:22.100
Things are going to get better.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.760
Just a glance at that word gives us that hope.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.950
This is where you take time to reflect.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.180
Who am I?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.240
Am I not imperfect too?

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.110
Is this not the person who committed to this
relationship considering me, this imperfect

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.460
me, a good enough human being?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.980
So what if this person is imperfect?

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.780
My imperfections along with this person’s
imperfections, when they come together, can

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.750
they make a perfect whole?

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.750
Can we..

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.910
Can we show some gratitude towards all that
we have been through?

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.079
Can we develop gratitude?

00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:55.720
We have built something after all!

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720
What have we created?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.380
We have created a relationship..

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.170
We have built a house..

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.529
We have made some friends.

00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:10.020
Or, if you want to enter the domain of company
and employee, you have worked here, you have

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.890
launched a product, you have served customers,
you have made a dent in the universe, can’t

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.760
you be a little more grateful about that?

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.380
We have done it together!!

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:28.650
This Reassessment Phase is called by marriage
counsellors and career counsellors alike as

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.220
the Second Honeymoon.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.080
The Reassessment Phase is where you rekindle
love.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.200
You fell in love..!

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.329
Long ago, you fell in love.

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:47.000
Now, you consciously RISE in love.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.350
That’s the Reassessment Phase.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.529
If the Reassessment is done appropriately,
it is usually followed by a Reunion Phase.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:55.529
You are growing.

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:59.279
You are growing older in the relationship.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:04.800
You are growing more senior, in the employee-company
relationship.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.680
All that you had created, they are growing
too.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.250
Your children, they are growing up.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.410
Your career, has reached a particular solidity.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.070
It won’t be ruffled all too easily.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.360
You won’t lose your job tomorrow.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.190
You don’t need to be afraid about it all
the time.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.399
Your financials are stable.

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:29.930
This is where the Reunion starts happening.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:35.700
You start consciously focusing on physical,
mental, emotional health.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:43.000
From the context of an employee-employer relationship,
most people say this is the most fulfilling

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
stage.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.340
For, this is when the employee starts wondering,
“What can I leave behind as a legacy?

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.370
You have given me unconditionally for so long,
all these years.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.030
Something makes me want to do something for
you in return.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:04.920
This is beyond just a I-do-work-you-pay-salary
phase.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.430
This is beyond all that.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.249
What more can I do?”

00:12:10.249 --> 00:12:11.249
This is the Reunion.

00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:14.839
What comes after this Reunion Phase?

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:21.750
At least in the Western approach to things,
they introduce a Phase called the Explosion

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.750
Phase.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:28.180
I was not able to relate to it naturally,
probably you can..

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:37.579
The Explosion Phase is supposed to be the
time a tragedy in the family, a health problem,

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:42.440
a financial incapacity, .. some sort of loss,
pain, disaster, some lifechanging moment happens..

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:48.430
Or, your children grow up, go for higher studies,
or leave home to pursue their career.. and

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.889
the house becomes empty suddenly..

00:12:49.889 --> 00:12:58.250
They call it The Empty Nest..

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:05.170
“Oh my God, we need to keep looking at each
other from now on?”

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.199
That time, is the Explosion Phase.

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:09.810
This is an inflection point.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.130
It can take the story in either direction.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.209
Towards disaster, or towards consummation.

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:24.010
If I were to draw a parallel with the employee-employer
relationship that we have been talking about

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.270
all along, I am empathising with all those
techies..

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:36.060
The nineties-kids, the eighties-kids, .. who
probably now are all managers..

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.060
Senior managers.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:46.810
It would have been quite a while since they
actively developed software, wrote code, did

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.250
real work..

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.040
They manage work.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.180
They get work done.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.000
Important role, no doubt.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.680
But, they are not in the thick of things.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:04.730
And, at this time, .. when a genie out of
the bottle like ChatGPT comes out, something

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.870
paradigm-shifting, .. who do they look to
for help?

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.690
Do they ask the company?

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.190
Will it help?

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:20.160
Will the company understand what these people
are passing through?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:28.149
Or, will they just be focused on, “What
can I do best with all these amazing youngsters

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:33.700
coming in… with amazing new knowledge…
let these oldies just rot..!”

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.930
Will that be their approach?

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:44.500
Much depends on how the company and the employee
deal with such tidal waves.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.790
The Explosion.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:51.900
I am able to relate to it better now.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.190
The final stage is the Completion Stage.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.300
The sunset phase, some may call it.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.630
Nothing more to do, is the feeling of the
moment.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.630
The contentment.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:11.460
The contentment that comes from realising
that not all known peaks need to be summited

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.850
before feeling satisfied!

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:18.269
It is not, “I have conquered every peak
there is, and hence I am content..”

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:24.670
It is, “I know there are peaks I have left
unconquered, and it is OKAY!”

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.030
That kind of contentment.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.880
You enjoy each others’ company.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.529
(Pun intended!)

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:34.630
You enjoy the company.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.970
And the company enjoys you.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.660
Not because you are the best.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.870
But because you have lasted.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.919
For, this lasting?

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:49.800
In family relationships, as well as in employee-employer
relationships, is so hard to come by these

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.000
days.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.759
A strength of commitment.

00:15:56.759 --> 00:16:00.759
Like an unshakeable pillar.

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:05.759
Like a venerable old banyan.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:06.759
Protecting.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:07.769
Weathering.

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:08.769
Passing through.

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:09.769
Surviving.

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:10.910
And thriving.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:20.010
And only when you have people like that, only
from people like that, can you learn by observing,

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.920
by being with them.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:29.620
Too many startups suffer from this biggest
problem (even without realising it themselves!)

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.020
There is no old-timer!

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.839
Everybody is two years old in the company.

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:42.251
When there is a person who has been around
for twenty-five long years, what all must

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.830
they have been through?

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:50.960
What all great positives and great negatives
they must have crossed?

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.890
Do you think they never ever fought even once
with their employer?

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.529
OF COURSE they would have!

00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:58.500
How did they overcome it?

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.699
What compromise did they draw?

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:03.370
What was the Win-Win they worked towards?

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.480
How much there is to learn!

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:13.329
Very similarly, instead of being stuck in
a 2BHK all by yourselves, if you were lucky

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:18.069
to be part of a large joint family… in one
corner, there is a grand-old pa and grand-old

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:22.360
ma, a 93 year old and an 89 year old!

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.160
The life lessons they can give us, if only
we ask them?

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.500
If only we just silently observe..

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.240
Worth their weight in gold..

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:41.710
Whichever phase we may be in, by the way,
there is one thing we can all do to survive

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:46.370
and float past that phase without too much
accident.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.630
It is picturised so beautifully in this movie.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.030
Remember Bruce Almighty?

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.750
This is a follow up, called Evan Almighty.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:59.070
God Himself has a conversation with a human
being.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.630
Orders him to build an Ark.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.680
Noah’s Ark.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:38.159
(The great ship(?)) And only later, does God
explain what ARK actually meant.

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:50.070
One act of random kindness.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.460
Act of Random Kindness.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:59.010
To put it simply, you don’t need to go in
search of auspicious days or propitious moments.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.030
To say Sorry.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.500
To offer Thank You.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.840
To gush I Love You.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.090
Take this as my .. probably only message for
the day.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:19.820
I am sure you will be a happier person, and..
you will LIVE with a happier person.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:26.910
As a closing thought something that I found
in this oddly arcane book..

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:37.230
A book from 1930.. a drama.. features this
beautiful quote.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.039
The quote goes like this.

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:51.940
“Women marry men hoping they will change.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:58.100
Men marry women hoping they won’t.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:06.270
And, each is inevitably disappointed!”

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.539
Interesting, is it not?

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:15.869
We will meet next week!

00:20:15.869 --> 00:20:25.529
Thank you!
