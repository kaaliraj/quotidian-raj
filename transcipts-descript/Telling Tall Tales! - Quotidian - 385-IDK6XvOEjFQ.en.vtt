00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:15.009
There was this movie titled “Vikram Vedha”.
Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. Good guy. Bad guy. 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:36.370
Good circumstances. Bad circumstances.
“Shall I tell you a story…, sir?” 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:01:00.160
The business of storytelling, and storytelling 
in business! Let us learn more about this!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.809
Namaste!

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:12.719
In the 267th Quotidian, we learned about the
art of storytelling. Yearn for a Yarn, was

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:19.030
its title! In the context of business, in
an organization, one can use “Storytelling”

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.170
to achieve much and have a great impact. You spin the narrative, you can empower the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:34.630
workforce, take them in a group direction,...
and there are many books that talk about

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.030
this, many famous personalities have given
advice. They have given speeches. When you

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.929
dig around, you will notice that there are
these seven items that stand individually,

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.229
from the rest, clamoring to
you “Do this.. Do this…!” I am going

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.170
to distill those seven items and present them
before you today, in this Quotidian.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.320
The first thing is, it is not enough if you
tell a story.. you need to be a conduit for

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.500
the rich exchange of stories between teller
and listener. You have to make it collaborative.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.050
It is not one storyteller telling his or her
story to everybody who is ……. aaaaah (openmouthed

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.260
wonder!) listening. It has to be collaborative.
If you want me to take a stellar example for

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:30.180
this, I again go to Apple. A website called
www.folklore.org! I am still amazed at how

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.150
lucky they got, when they registered such
a domain name for themselves! Traditional

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.590
ancient word-of-mouth stories and anecdotes,
dot org! If you step inside, there are some

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.480
hundred and twenty five plus stories by employees,
customers, partners, visionaries, founders

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.450
of Apple. Including Steve Jobs himself. And,
their hard work, their creations, their launches,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.531
the trials they went through, the challenges
they faced, the politics, the fights, the

00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:10.970
chemistry, the successes, the failures, everything
intertwined and woven into an amazing tapestry!

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:19.031
Look at that sentence. It is a website devoted
to collective historic storytelling. Every

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:27.069
company needs a website like this. At least
on its intranet. Because as people join the

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.900
workforce, they need to know about the antiquated
history. If they are doing something today,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.590
it is because they WERE doing something yesterday.
And that is because, they STARTED doing something

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.710
twenty-five years ago! That is important!

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:54.360
The second little nugget that you will unearth
when you dig around about storytelling in

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:04.849
business, it is to make it Engaging. Engaging?
Yes, the medium can make or break the message

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:16.120
you want to convey. There will always have
to be a grounding to what you already know.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.620
But, there is no point in repeating what everybody
already knows! There has to be something new.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.949
It can’t be completely new! You will be
mind-blown! There has to be familiarity, there

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:36.400
has to be a little-beyond-reach, some unfamiliarity.
There was this movie called “Turbo”. 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.670
A snail… it immediately conjures up images
of slow movement. It is an animal. Going slowly.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:51.289
But, this animal has a desire...A dream. I
want to win in the races someday! I must be

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.780
a Racer Snail. There is a story that is spun
around it, just like the radioactive spider

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.819
that bit Spider-Man, here, it falls into the
exhaust of a car, gets infused with Nitrous

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:11.180
Oxide, and… in a believable manner, they
give an extension, and that is how you engage

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:20.300
an audience. And, once you engage, you can
give them your indoctrination!

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.840
The third little thing is, there has to
be structure! The moment you saw these four

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.930
letters, I am sure you have started wondering
what the four-letter word I have placed here

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.069
in a random jumble is, … you must have arrived
at CAKE as the answer. But, it was a little

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:40.720
hard, wasn’t it? The end goal is to get
to CAKE, but what is the structure you are

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.210
going to provide to them?
If you give them just this… they may try

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.830
a multitude of combinations… including perhaps
C K E A, and finally, they may arrive C A

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.610
K E, the right sequence!

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:07.770
But, imagine you give them a visual aid, like
this. As you form the letters, the beautiful

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.620
plate and that cylinder of that cake assist
you in forming the right word. You cannot

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:23.250
form “C A K E” in any other manner. If
you form it, it will look ugly. This makes

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.130
it so simple and easy that it becomes child’s
play!

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:37.139
You can take it even further! How about this?
You cut the jigsaw, the piece, so that they

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:46.650
will only fit in the right sequence...The
more structure you provide, the more they

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.800
will stop bothering about.. hey, is this the
end, is this the beginning, in what part of

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.970
the story are we currently, .. when is the
interval… they will stop bothering about

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.650
it.. and they will start paying attention
to the message in the story. If you try stunts

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.220
like in Virumaandi, or plan your plot like
the movie Vantage Point, or script your stories

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.990
like Rashomon (Kurasawa), the Japanese director,
people will take too long to first understand

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:22.370
where the story begins, how it is proceeding,
and they may miss out on the essence under

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.419
the message! Careful!

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:33.729
The next item is Performance. Anybody can
just narrate a story. But, every storytelling

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:40.889
moment is an opportunity to perform. A performance
doesn’t just mean you stand on the stage

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.699
and deliver something. It is about the words
you use, it is about the body language, it

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:53.580
is about the tone, it is about the tempo,
the timing, the props you use.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.479
Look at Steve Jobs. 2002. A coffin. On a stage!
He is burying something. An OS! “Mac OS

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:42.640
9 was a friend to us all! Please join me in
a moment of silence, as we remember our old

00:08:42.640 --> 00:09:07.800
friend, Mac OS 9!” A rose to boot! He basically
RULED the day! Users were clamouring not to

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.930
retire the version 9! At that time, by telling
a story like this, and along the way, criticising

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.900
Microsoft for something, criticising software
pirates for something, … watch the video

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:27.400
in full! I have chopped off a few parts. The
way he used those props, and the way he rallied

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:35.190
the audience to empathise with him, and commiserate
about what is happening, that was beautiful.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:43.270
So, every storytelling moment is an opportunity
to perform magic. Remember that magician on

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.010
stage.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:53.990
Then, it has to be tangible. Tangible? Something
that you can touch and feel. See by eye, hear

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:59.020
by ear, the sense organs get suffused by the
input… That is why many people don’t like

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.761
the television much. Or watch it in a theater.
They want to watch a drama instead. Why? In

00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:09.780
a drama, there is a three-dimensional depth
involved. In a drama, I can see, I can touch,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:19.580
I can feel. Watch this performer on stage.
His name is Tom Sligting. He is… a global

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:33.250
speaker. And, one of the things he does on
stage to engage with the audience… is…

00:10:33.250 --> 00:12:04.050
Catapultiser! For Q and A! So, it is a fluffy
toy, a 

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:10.020
squeezy toy, so it can take a fall. It has
got a microphone embedded inside. So, people

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:16.510
can actually hold the toy close to their mouth
and they can actually speak out their question.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.710
“Can I have the mic please?”, “Wait,
the mic is coming!”, … nothing of that

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:26.540
sort! Compare with this! Such a beautiful
performer — I have seen him live twice till

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:34.100
now, and Tom Sligting has figured out … that
tangible storytelling. He is implementing

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.250
it perfectly. Not only tangible! He is also
collaborating. Because he is making the audience

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:45.910
participate too! He is creating a great confluence
of thoughts and narratives! That is TWO out

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.350
of SEVEN!

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:58.520
Then, it has to be fun! What is fun? You need
to mock somebody. Somebody must be the brunt

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.330
of that joke. Could be we ourselves! Could
be the person with us. Or, could be somebody

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:10.050
else outside, elsewhere. Fun is also, if you
dig deep and analyse it, you will realise,

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:19.000
it is the slight bending of rules. A person
walking, should continue walking… But, why

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.760
is that person falling? Well, there is a banana
peel on the floor that he didn’t see. So,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.540
a little fun! Bending of the rules of gravity.
Watch this movie. We all know Shrek, the green

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:54.790
monster! We all wait… Anticipating she will
turn into a beautiful princess.. She has fallen.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:14:15.540
She is turned the other way. She gets up.
There, we get a lesson! You are beautiful

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:23.710
to my eyes, just like I am handsome in your
eyes! So, it is a sense of expectation, that

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:30.371
suddenly deflates, or suddenly takes a completely
different direction. It is a great way to

00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:35.780
introduce a little fun. They would have all
laughed, when they watched this particular

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:42.920
scene. The moment this is done, a nice philosophical
lesson… “Hey, She looks good to me, and

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.850
that’s what matters!” A great storytelling
strategy!

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:56.330
And finally, it has to be realistic. The moment
I say realistic, I am reminded of that waterfall

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:02.940
in which Baahubali performs a death-defying
stunt. He will jump into empty space, turn

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:10.430
180 degrees, shoot an arrow, the arrow will
carry a vine, it will get knotted up into

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:18.210
a tree, and then he will… A little realism
is useful. It has to be plausible. It has

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:25.460
to be applicable. Yes, it can be a little
out of reach, but it has to be believable.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:31.280
There used to be this rumour about Rajini
Kanth, that he had acted thus in a movie.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.220
I came to know, later, that it wasn’t Rajini.
San Basilio — a Filipino movie. Came out

00:15:38.220 --> 00:16:02.050
in 1981. A scene in that movie rolls thus!
A bullet...Only one bullet remains. Two people

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:09.860
running. This man uses a knife to slice the
bullet in its path… and hits two different

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:36.790
people. By the way, myth busters have tested
it… and after testing it,…have declared

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:46.200
that this is actually possible! You CAN actually
aim a bullet at a knife.. The knife doesn’t

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.780
even need to be too sharp or strong, because
of the speed at which the bullet is coming,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:58.740
it can actually be split in two.. But, it
is still not believable, is it? If you are

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:06.180
going to tell us a story, ground it. Make
it believable. Then, push it just a little

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:15.250
beyond that envelope. That is how you master
that art of storytelling for business empowerment.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:23.230
So, let us quickly summarise those seven items.
It has to be collaborative. It has to be engaging.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:29.630
That is very important. It has to be structured.
Where is the head. Where is the tail. It has

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:36.460
to be performative. Remember Steve Jobs. It
has to be tangible. I should be able to touch,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:43.470
feel, probably even smell, whatever.. Those
sense organs, it has to impact. It has to

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:52.120
be fun. And finally, hey, make it a little
believable...Introduce realism into it. 

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.230
Thank you!
Oh, we will meet again on the 13th of this

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.559
month. Bye bye!
