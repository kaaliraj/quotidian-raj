00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.030
Welcome back to the quotidian reports from
me!

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.120
Way back in 1985, a “superhit” movie hit
the theatres.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.310
Its name was “Mudhal Mariyaadhai” — First
Respect or Priority Respect.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.089
Shivaji Ganesan, Radha, a beautiful love story
— between an old man and a very young girl.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.760
A young girl who would have entered the village
as a derelict from the neighbouring village.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.760
A very interesting story.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760
An award-winning story.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.869
This bagged national awards on multiple categories.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.829
I want to talk to you about an interesting
scene that features in this movie.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:37.829
A tree.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.280
A large boulder at the foot of the tree.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.190
The girl and the man having an interesting
conversation there.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.600
The hero wants to convince the girl that he
is still strong and vivacious, even though

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.200
he may appear old.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.170
It is almost as if Shivaji wants to marry
the girl, playfully, … and the girl, for

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.330
fun, taunts him with a challenge — Demonstrate
your virility by lifting this boulder!

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.150
I will marry you right away!

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.310
From that day on, every day, on his way back
from his work in the field, Shivaji tries

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:35.360
his hand at lifting the stone… fails over
and over again, until… one day… he succeeds.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.880
It is an interesting side story to a beautiful
emotional “blockbuster” movie, actually.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:54.310
While researching about 
this video, I came to know that there is,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.300
indeed, a real and prevalent practice like
this, even today, in rural South India.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.680
In remote villages near Pudukkottai and Madurai,
the boys are tempted and taunted by the girls,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.099
challenged to lift stone spheres like the
one shown.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.409
It is called the “Ilavattakkal”.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.100
Like the challenge to control and make the
bull submissive in “Jallikkattu”, this

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.710
seems to be a “Veera Vilaiyaattu” (Brave
Man’s Adventure) in Tamil lore.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.710
A time-worn tradition.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.680
The reason we went on this historic analysis?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.190
I wanted to explain Goodhart’s Law to you.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.049
It says, “When a measure becomes a target,
it ceases to be a good measure”.

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:48.569
If there is a measure, and we start obsessing
about a specific measure as a target, it is

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.790
no longer a good measure.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.280
This is because the participants will start
focusing on the wrong metric.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.730
For example, assume you are in a nail-manufacturing
factory…

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:08.109
If you are told that you would be evaluated
on the number of nails you manufacture per

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.260
day, you will probably end up manufacturing
thousands of minuscule nails — utterly useless!

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.939
At the same time, if you are told that you
would be evaluated on the weight of the nails

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:29.980
you manufacture per day, you will swing to
the other extreme and perhaps fashion huge

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.579
nails the size of the ones used in the Titanic!

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.549
Three humongous nails — again useless — but
matching the requirement of maximum weight!

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:45.890
So, it is very important what you measure,
what you set as a target…

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.830
Where is it important?

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.260
Take a school for instance.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.269
If you set artificial targets like X marks
in Y subject, schools will deteriorate into

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.579
glorified tuition centres.

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.129
Previous year question papers will be in high
demand.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.909
Just think about it.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.689
Is that good education?

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:06.689
The cause?

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:07.689
Goodhart’s Law!

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:13.459
You are setting something as the target, and
the people are focusing on the target.

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.160
And people are forgetting the philosophy behind
the target.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.630
Take a job interview for instance.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.640
To apply for jobs in Microsoft and Google,
they sell books now!

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.100
“How to crack the Google Coding Interview”
— claims one book.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.340
Is that the right approach?

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.900
If you were to attend an interview at some
of these companies, they would disconnect

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.550
the internet connection, set a countdown clock,
perhaps even dangle a Damoclean sword above

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.130
your head, and challenge you to solve problems!

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.130
Is that the right approach??

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.610
Is that even remotely related to how you are
going to do your day-to-day-work if you get

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.700
selected at this company?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.620
Shouldn’t the ideal interview be a genuine
high-fidelity reproduction of the scenario

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.670
you would face on a typical day instead?

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.651
And see how you behave, how you collaborate
with others in your attempt to resolve the

00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.651
situation?

00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:52.651
Goodhart’s Law again…

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:53.651
Take management itself.

00:04:53.651 --> 00:05:00.875
I have called it 1.0 because, this is the
management styles of yore that I am talking about.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.540
How would they manage customer service representatives,
for example?

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.390
The manager sidles up and declares, “I am
going to improve productivity.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.790
I have noticed that people handle only 25
calls every day.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.290
I am going to boost it up to 40 calls a day.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.290
He sets the target.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.290
And, guess what?

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.470
The calls end up being 45 calls a day.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.700
Everybody is thrilled.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.920
But, that’s when the manager’s manager
comes along, and notices… that the customer

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.950
service representatives are in such a hurry
to move on to the next call that they don’t

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.310
even have time for a customary thank you,
and a warm good bye, before moving on.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.370
And, who’s the loser in this whole engagement?

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.370
The customer.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.370
And hence, the business.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.120
Customer delight takes the brunt of this well-intended-exercise
gone bad.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.060
So, setting the goal correctly is ninety percent
of all kinds of productivity-management.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.010
I think we all should internalise this very
well, before heading out to setting goals

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.010
and managing people.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.590
I have a few other interesting things to share
about this “Mudhal Mariyaadhai” movie.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.230
Just about this scene that we saw a while
ago…

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.600
So, this is a “To Be Continued” kinda
episode.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.389
See you tomorrow!
