00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.710
This man here, his name is Jim Rohn.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.429
An American entrepreneur, motivational speaker,
author, a person who has had a positive impact

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.289
on the lives of so many people!

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.830
One interesting, almost mathematical formula
he gave us — goes like this!

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.550
Who are You?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:38.060
Well, the five people that you spend the most
time with… that you interact the most with..

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.820
their AVERAGE..

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.420
That is who you are!

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.930
My question is, is there a similar formula
for a company?

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.930
For an organisation?

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.980
For an enterprise?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.370
Who should they keep near them?

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.960
Who should they keep away??

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.780
Namaste!

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:21.430
Three Partners!

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.880
If you are running an organisation, who are
the kinds of people that you need to have

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.680
with you, and who should you probably stay
away from??

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.680
The interesting answer to this intriguing
question.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.820
That is what we are going to see in this book.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.000
It is our same old friend, Seth Godin, but
this is very long ago.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.140
Long ago!

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.340
Almost 30 / 40 years ago.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.460
Before he became famous.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.090
He is looking like a Tamil movie villain here.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.340
But, he has written a beautiful book called
The Bootstrapper’s Bible — I don’t have

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.460
much money, but I have an amazing idea, now,
if I have to start a company, what should

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.960
I keep in mind — beautiful nuggets of wisdom
that caters to bootstrappers.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.920
That’s what you would find in this book.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.349
The three kinds of people that you need to
keep near you, and conversely, away from you…

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.620
for ensuring success in your startup..

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.620
A short list.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.330
That is what we are going to see today.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.349
He stretches it to such an extent that he
says, if you don’t have the right kind of

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:47.799
those three people, yes, it will grow, like
a banyan tree… but, like a bonsai tree.

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.609
Short.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.409
Stunted.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.219
Grotesque.

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.029
Beware!

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.769
The first kind that he talks about — is
of course, Customers.

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.029
They are the very reason the business even
exists!

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:08.629
But, there are some kinds of customers who
can turn toxic.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.519
Now, take a look at this interface.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.129
This is a file-open dialog.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.769
As recent as 2021–22.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.060
Have you ever seen such an UGLY dialog anywhere,
ever?

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:40.689
You will be shocked if I tell you that this
is the dialog for an image-editing software.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:51.120
Gimp is an open source software — comes
as part of the Linux operating system.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.209
This claims to be a competitor to Adobe Photoshop.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.189
Can it have such a pathetic file-dialog?

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.609
The only reason for it to be so abysmally
bad?

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.370
The customers just don’t care.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.449
The customers are all geeks.

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.839
They are not interested in aesthetic beauty
as much as they are interested in raw power,

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:18.350
performance, hacking, security, and so, … if
you are going to cater to such customers,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:27.940
you’ll start thinking that pathetic interfaces
like these are “good enough”.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.860
Here is another example.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.300
The export-dialog of Microsoft Word.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.410
In this export-dialog, look at that.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.710
The XPS format.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.710
Probably, in the world, there are some 13
people, who use this file format.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.200
PDF is world-renowned.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.030
XPS, a format that Microsoft itself brought
out and tried to popularise, failed completely.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.470
But still, there a couple of customers somewhere
in some dark corner of the world who are still

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.590
using that format, and Microsoft continues
to labor, continues to give valuable real-estate

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.840
in its interface, for the XPS format.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.780
So, that is the second lesson we can take
about customers.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.640
There will be some customers who will want
to take you in a different direction, who

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.009
will make a lot of noise.

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.920
Don’t be mistaken.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.090
Don’t mistake LOUDNESS for NUMEROUSNESS.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.440
And be distracted into building something
only very few want.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.710
Valuable advice.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.860
And finally, this is the Panda.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.340
The only reason it is in the endangered species
list?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:57.770
It is because, 99% of its diet is consisting
of bamboos.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.710
If the bamboos get stricken by blight, if
the bamboo in that locality have a bad season,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:12.990
if some humans come and raze a forest of bamboo
down, these cannot eat anything else and they

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.990
die.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.159
Don’t be such a company.

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.600
Don’t depend on a single customer.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.139
We all know what happened during Covid.

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.590
We all know what happened when we all depended
on that single manufacturer of ventilators.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.039
So, again, these are the kind of customers
you should stay away from.

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.560
And, yes, we have encountered this curve from
Geoffrey Moore earlier too.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:48.710
The early adopter, if we can put extra effort
for such a customer, and make some amazing

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.030
stuff that pleases them, they will ensure
we go in the right direction.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.680
They have a huge following — and they will
bring more customers to our fold.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.060
Those are the kind of customers you should
have.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.060
Alright, customers..

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.340
what is the second kind?

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.050
The second kind is of course, employees.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.300
Most of us start our company as a single,
solopreneur.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.210
We have an idea, we start building something.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.770
Along the way, we realise that there is so
much to do, and we try to get somebody to

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.960
help us.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.330
We employ people.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:37.900
We employ them in the hope that they will
save us time and that they will take ownership

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.360
of the work we give them.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.230
But, more often than not, what happens?

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:56.319
You end up wasting valuable time ensuring
that their output is up to your expectations.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:04.320
We started employing people that we could
not trust for quality and quantity and that

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.889
is the reason the phrase called “Management
Overhead” was born!

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:12.419
So, pick them well, pick them wisely, take
care of them, train them, and let them do

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:18.180
their thing, don’t waste time micromanaging
them.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:24.500
Also, we have deliberated much on the “Start
With Why” concept.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.289
If the “vision”, the “global vision”
pulling everybody towards one direction is

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.930
missing, this is how it will be..

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.480
Like unmagnetised iron!

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.970
Okay, one might think:- whatever personal
directions you may be dragging it in, I, as

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.280
the master, will impose my vision on you!

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.200
Yes, as long as the cat is around, the mice
won’t play!

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.750
But, what do you need?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:09:00.410
You need to DERIVE the vision from the alignment
of each one of those employees.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.410
Something like this!

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:08.410
In the case of the Dandi March, did everybody
follow him because he went ahead of everybody?

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:15.470
Or, he was one of the people who inspired
and motivated, but there were a thousand such

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.060
marches..

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.040
There were a thousand such small revolutions…

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.170
already lining up towards a free India!

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.200
And, Gandhi became the most important marcher.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.840
So, when every one of them has a shared vision,
that is what you need to see…

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:43.420
When we recruit somebody, we look at ability,
skill, attitude, … but do we check if there

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.500
is “vision”?

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.790
It is TOXIC if a person lacks vision!

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.430
Talking about “toxins”, I have personally
seen..

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:57.310
There are some employees who move around as
if they have a raincloud over their head.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.660
All around, things would be bright and spectacular.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:08.210
But, only when they walk over, it would seem
as if they are carrying the whole weight of

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.810
a miserable world in their shoulders.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:17.770
It is good to have such people SOMETIMES,
to burst the bubble, to be in touch with reality…

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.970
But, not probably all the time.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:28.120
They have a negative impact on the morale
of the overall employee group, so, you need

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.550
to be careful about that.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.900
And, finally, we have talked enough about
this elusive word “Culture”.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.800
Books have been written, articles have been
penned, speeches have been delivered…

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.140
What is culture, exactly?

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.420
Somebody put an interesting twist to it.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:53.320
They said, “It is what the employees do,
when they are not working.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.880
It is what the employees behave like, when
nobody is watching!”

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.360
Because, this is what we think.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.820
We have employed somebody, we have given them
some work, they will deliver that work, we

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.380
will give them some salary, job done!

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:16.680
But no, these employees, they set the pace
of work.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.210
They set the tone.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.760
They bring a rhythm.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.010
You are trying to create a mellifluous orchestra.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:31.280
It is your responsibility that nobody “off
key” comes in!

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.530
Don’t forget!

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:40.640
That is an important aspect of culture, and
when they are alone, and they meet somebody

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.950
outside, they are actually representing the
company.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.750
They ARE the company!

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.890
Can they do a good job of that?

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.400
Evaluate that too!

00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:00.170
The third group of people, that most often
gets ignored, because we are too busy sitting

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:07.150
in front of our computer, handling customers,
managing employees, is, the concept of a Peer.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.360
So, who is this Peer?

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.140
They are not people we sell to.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.390
They are not people we buy from.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.140
They are not people that we employ.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.300
Who are they?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.940
They are the people who share this world with
us!

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.730
They are peers.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.970
Probably they are in the same domain.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.940
Probably they are competitors.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.950
Probably they were competitors.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.110
Probably someday they will be competitors.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:46.230
People that we could interact with without
actually having a business reason.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:53.480
Too often, we don’t do that, and Seth Godin
says, that is a bad idea.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.680
You need to stretch.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.530
You need to reach out.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:06.830
You need to actually do that Random Acts of
Kindness and help people.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:07.830
Help people?

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.830
Yes.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.490
They often say what goes around comes around.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.310
Go ahead.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.310
Do favours.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.520
Thank an employee.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.080
Thank a colleague.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.350
Thank somebody in the same business domain.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.270
With no intent of gaining something back from
them.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.750
Can you do that?

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.230
Brag about their company!

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.260
Write something good about them!

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.150
If you get a particular customer and you are
not able to handle them immediately, refer

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.620
them to the other person.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:43.440
If you are looking at an amazing talent, and
you don’t have an opening right now, refer

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.230
them to the other friend.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.820
You are winning two friends by doing so!

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.880
The person you refer, and the person you refer
to!

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.240
Both stand to benefit!

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.420
Think about that!

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:02.120
Volunteer to provide case studies and testimonials!

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.330
Reach out to your business fraternity.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.200
Carve time from your busy schedule!

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.720
You don’t know how soon you are going to
be benefited by that!

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:20.950
When he says, “Reach out!”, he also adds
another dimension to it!

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.320
He says, “You may look at them as competitors..

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.880
I am a red circle.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.280
That guy, you know what, that guy is a green
circle.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.850
That other guy, he is a blue circle!”

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:42.000
And that is when you need a small change in
perspective.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.690
The moment a triangle and a square come along,
you immediately become, hey, “We are all

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.690
circles yaar..

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.780
Aren’t we together in this?”

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:58.430
The moment you start thinking like that, you
will immediately find something in common

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.250
rather than something that differentiates
you..

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.050
Okay, square, circle, triangle…

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:09.370
Just when you are wondering what could be
common about such disparate shapes, … if

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:15.360
somebody else comes along, in a three-dimensional
manner, immediately you can say, “We are

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.780
all two-dimensional shapes after all”, and
promote to a higher level of abstraction.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:29.620
So, if you are keen on networking, you will
find a way to see something in common, even

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:35.420
between the most distinct and the most diverse
of entities..

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.140
And, that is a very good skill to cultivate!

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.130
I am sure you all remember this story.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:49.620
If you are stuck in a group, don’t get stuck
like that bucket full of crabs…

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.850
There is no lid on it because any crab that
tries to get out, the other crabs will pull

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.850
back!

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.850
They even branded it “Indian Crabs”.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.850
Indian mentality, it seems..

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:05.460
Well, when such a story was making the rounds,
one guy saw a crab trying to escape!

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.620
He questioned the crab!

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.050
“Hey, haven’t you heard of this fable?

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:18.000
The moment you try to reach the top, you are
going to be pulled back in by all your brethren..

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.270
Didn’t you know??”

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.820
Asked the guy to the crab.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:28.220
To which the crab replied, “I think I have
the biceps for it.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:35.350
When somebody pulls me down, I think, I can
hold on tight enough, that they can realise

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:41.580
perhaps, ‘Hey wait, why can’t I form a
chain and let all crabs come out instead?’

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.040
That is what I have prepared myself for!”

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:55.060
So, even if you feel stuck, in a group that
is seeming to pull you down, turn the table,

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.650
look conversely, and see what you can do to
uplift everybody..

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.050
To float every boat.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.270
This is Vince Lombardi.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.530
A football coach from USA.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.530
Very famous.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.910
The reason the team Green Bay Packers became
famous was NOT BECAUSE of the players, but

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.310
because of the coach!

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:25.120
He quoted something pithy, and that is what
comes to mind as I close.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:40.750
He said, be they customers, be they employees,
be they peers…

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:48.480
“If you are not FIRED with enthusiasm, You
will be fired with ENTHUSIASM!”

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.630
Thank you!

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.080
Let us meet again next week!
