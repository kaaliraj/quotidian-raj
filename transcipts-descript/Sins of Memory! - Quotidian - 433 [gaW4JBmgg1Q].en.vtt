00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.129
There was a king.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.450
He wanted to live forever.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.590
Like most kings do!

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.349
He called the minister, and ordered him to
work something out!

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.630
The minister, clever and wise that he was,
he gave this king a glass bottle with a potion

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.910
inside it.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:32.660
And, just when the king was about to down
that potion in a gulp, the minister intervened

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.660
and said, “Just a minute, your Majesty.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.221
You need to also know where this potion is
coming from..!

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:41.110
So, this is the white mandrill from deep in
the jungles of Africa.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.500
We have concocted this potion by taking teardrops
from its eyes, mucus from its nostrils, and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.739
saliva from its fangs and combining them on
a full moon night.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.219
Just don’t try to remember where this is
coming from.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:16.850
You may be able to drink it only then!!”

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.360
Namaste!

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:32.140
Four hundred and… thirty three I think..Yes..
Four hundred and thirty three..

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.979
This is about memory.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.930
Especially, the sins.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.240
Sins of memory.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.350
Let’s get in..!

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.570
We have already encountered this book.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.340
About the mind…

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:57.729
In fact, I had told you that we use this book
at the Zoho School of Design.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.590
Its title, the titles of its chapters, are
all about how weak the observation ability

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:15.860
of the eyes are, ears are, our attention span,
and so on, everything with a negative undertone.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.470
One of the chapters is about this..

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.200
Our Attention is Limited; Our Memory is Imperfect!

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:40.430
How we, in spite of known problems and difficulties,
continue to think that our memory is perfect!

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.610
Any religion, not just Christianity, .. talks
about sins.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.100
Cardinal Sins.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.300
Such a bad, wrong thing to do.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.790
To even THINK about doing them.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.680
Seven deadly sins, they called it.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.379
While I was researching about it, I came to
know that it is not really mentioned in The

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.379
Holy Bible.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.570
Unlike The Ten Commandments.., there is no
LIST called The Seven Deadly Sins.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.420
But, there indeed is an informal list of what
God hates.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.459
Over the years, our folks have filtered and
created a Seven Deadly Sins list.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.000
And, what does that list feature?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.110
Yes, Lust, Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, Envy, Wrath,
and Pride…

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.849
But, there is a Seven Deadly Sins of Memory,
did you know?

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.000
Without our knowledge or conscious collaboration,
with no way out without having to suffer it,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.250
this list is the trap of the Seven Deadly
Sins of Memory.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.650
Written by Daniel Schacter.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.450
We are going to wind our way through these
seven.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.970
And to remember them easily, I am going to
give you a prop.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:03.900
Far out, in space, small and large rocks floating
around aimlessly, sometimes they even reach

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.950
Earth, hit Earth, threaten to hit Earth..
remember them?

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:15.120
That is what we are going to use as a background
framework while we walk through these seven.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.970
Number One is Transcience.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.120
The word itself means, Here today, Gone tomorrow.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.669
Here this second.

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.910
Gone after just a while.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.950
Short term memory, they call it.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.090
Things that… you probably…

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.380
there is a bank transaction..

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.720
they give you a token for queueing up.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.030
Your brain tells you — “You idiot, don’t
remember this forever..

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.229
You need to remember this, yes, but you need
to remember this only until your token is

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.229
called.

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.840
Anybody who remembers it even afterwards is
an idiot.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.720
Anybody who doesn’t remember it until then
is also an idiot!

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720
Transcience!

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.699
In our educational endeavours?

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.970
What is the important mistake we make?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.000
Important things end up being placed in the
Transient bucket.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.470
That is the mistake.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.430
As you can see in the picture, that asteroid
is flying towards Earth.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.031
But, it doesn’t even reach the surface of
the Earth.

00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:20.720
It burns up in the atmosphere.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.039
It is there.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.470
A blinding streak of light.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.570
But, it is not there.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.570
It is gone.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.860
Even before you ask, “Hey, what is that?!”,
it is gone!

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.440
Transient!

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.910
The Second Sin of Memory is Absent-Mindedness.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.080
I am standing in front of you.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.410
I am telling you something important.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.009
I am not sure if you are really listening.

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.220
Probably you have another tab open.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.100
Probably you are fiddling with something on
your mobile phone as you listen to me.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.970
There are so many distractions in this world.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.330
And these distractions, sometimes, become
the main attraction!

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.039
So, things that are supposed to reach you,
supposed to make an impact on you, supposed

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:19.650
to become a short term and then a long term
memory inside you, completely miss you.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:28.811
My dad used to blast me thus: “My grandpa
used to tell me that I have this habit of

00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:36.840
taking stuff through one ear and letting it
pass smoothly and unminded through the other

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.190
ear, but in your case, it looks like you are
afraid that while passing between the ears

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.620
they might be absorbed a bit by the brain,
and so you are focusing on echoing it off

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.199
the ear that receives it without any possibility
of it passing through and getting absorbed!

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.520
You seem so absent-minded!

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.520
Showing little attention..!”

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.550
The asteroid that passes so close to Earth,
but misses.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.260
No impact!

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.250
Not only is it transient, you will not be
able to recall that it even happened.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.250
“What?!

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.530
Did I even say something like that?!”

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.750
How often has it happened in YOUR life?!

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.130
The Third Sin is Blocking.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.970
Blocking is another way of referring to the
“Tip of the tongue” situation.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.530
You will meet somebody..

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.470
You will remember his name.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:31.690
Some name that starts with A and ends with
A.., would be all you could remember.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.690
Aaah…!

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.690
What is this?

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.919
What kind of memory is this?

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.900
On the tip of your tongue… dancing tantalisingly.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.110
You will be able to recall correctly if offered
a this-or-that choice.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:48.980
But, that real value of it, what is the exact
complete content of it, will always slip your

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.980
mind…

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.980
Why is this?

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.419
Well, scientists are still divided about the
real manner in which memories are stored in

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:56.419
the brain.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:02.229
A memory is not a particular cell in a particular
part of the brain..

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:05.699
A small tap there, and it comes back to recall!

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:09.509
Or a slight bang elsewhere, and you will forget
it forever!

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:10.509
No!

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:19.000
It is a collection of neurons, talking to
each other, forming a network, becoming stronger,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.160
which means electrical signals can pass faster..
that is memory!

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.530
As you recall it more and more, memory becomes
stronger!

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:35.240
When you look at it from that viewpoint, what
is Blocking?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:43.690
When you have a particular thing, that is
so comfortable for you.. probably the color

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:50.910
of a person, or their tone of voice, or their
physical shape and structure, you probably

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:58.530
enjoy, you probably remember a lot of.. but
that is only one aspect, one dimension.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:04.920
If you can’t remember something multidimensionally,
the memory doesn’t really form.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.209
That strength of memory is missing, they say.

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:13.990
This crater, for example, is the Crater in
Arizona.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.579
A huge meteor has fallen, but where is the
meteor??

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:17.660
Yes, it has indeed fallen..

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.550
Yes, the name starts with A and ends with
A!!

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.280
But, where is the meteor?

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.290
It is far underneath!

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.440
Deep down!

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.250
It has penetrated the surface and hidden itself
deep underground.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.380
It has left a one-dimensional something to
perceive.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.230
A crater.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.330
But, where is the meteor?

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.010
Do you understand?

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.050
That is another sin it seems — it is called
Blocking.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.640
The tip-of-the-tongue problem!

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.029
The Fourth Sin is Misattribution.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:55.620
If you look at the Moon, this is how it would
look.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.300
But, this is the face it presents us..

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.600
As we see from Earth.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.950
It always shows us only one face, all the
time..

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.779
There is another face.

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:09.850
The Far Side of the Moon, they call it.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.190
Do you know how it looks?

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.950
This is the far side of the moon.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:23.339
This far side.., it almost looks like the
angry rashes on the face of a teenage girl,

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:25.820
doesn’t it?

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.779
Such a pimply surface!

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:38.050
Can you tell whether that particular thing
there was created by a particular meteor?

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:44.079
Don’t you see another meteor crater overlapping
it?

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:52.050
There is a small meteor crater formed inside
the circumference of a larger meteor crater,

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.050
do you see?

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.710
A meteor crater has perhaps been completely
obliterated by the new, larger one that formed

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.540
later, did you notice?!

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:05.029
This is the exact thing that happens when
you collect your memories.

00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:08.680
How often have we fallen into that trap?!

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.259
“Hey, I have seen this exact person in that
other movie!

00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:14.930
I watched that other movie, I have seen her!

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.930
Surely!”

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.139
you would say.

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:19.139
Misattribution.

00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:23.720
“I have read this book, I have watched this
movie, I have met this person”, but you

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.089
wouldn’t have.

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:27.490
Crosstalk happening!

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.980
Neurons are triggering crosstalk!

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.709
And that is why your memory is not perfect!

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:38.639
Because, you misattribute!

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:42.810
You would exclaim deja vu!

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.370
Yes, it seems, but that is not true.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.390
Misattribution.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.769
The next sin is Suggestibility.

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:53.170
Great Wall of China.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.389
We have heard much about it.

00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:56.870
A true ethereal beauty.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.980
Really beautiful place.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:06.220
But, there is a prideful claim that the Chinese
used to make about it.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.840
They used to call The Great Wall so GREAT
that it was the only man-made thing that was

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.220
visible even from outer space.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.660
Even from The Moon!

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.070
It had become a widespread myth.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:25.370
Everybody started thinking that this Great
Wall was the only human-made entity visible

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.209
from The Moon.

00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:32.540
It remained a big popularising story..

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:40.100
The Great Wall received a lot more tourists,
surely.. until, people went into space and

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.160
started looking for the Great Wall, and couldn’t
spot it.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:52.019
In fact, Yang Liwei, the first Chinese astronaut,
taikonauts they call themselves..

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:58.079
He searched far and wide, and had to confess,
“Sorry, I couldn’t spot The Great Wall”.

00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:01.260
Why did we even believe something like that?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:12.439
From childhood, we have been told about the
vada-making grandma in the Moon, the Chandamama,

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:18.040
… and claiming a twenty-foot-wide stone
structure will be visible from outer space..!

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.550
Who starts these?

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:24.340
But, we start believing it and that myth is
perpetuated.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.340
That is exactly how our mind operates too.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:36.410
All you need to have is one strong message..
repeated probably at an impressionable age..

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.470
repeated multiple times.. and your memory
becomes Suggestible.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.290
Not only that, we can also change the existing
memory!

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.370
Remember Misattribution?

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.050
Suggestibility is another sin.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.350
The Sixth Sin is Consistency Bias.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:14:01.570
You have understood something in some way..
accepted it in a particular way.. then, you

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:07.300
probably want to believe that it will be so
in the future also.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:15.329
Similarly, if you believe something to be
true at this time, now, you work backwards,

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:19.750
and want to believe that that is how it was
earlier also..

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.889
So, if you recall that “Flat Earth” school
of thought..

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:31.420
The King thought this was all the world that
was, at that time.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.019
Then, they crossed the seas and oceans, and
discovered more places.

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:38.800
But, warned us of the edges..

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.630
Careful not to fall off!

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.680
Then, we mapped the whole world..

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.600
But we continued to map it in that comfortable,
flatworld approach.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.639
So, this became our depiction of the world.

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:57.590
How wrong it is…?!

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:05.529
When we go into Space, and do a proper lookaround,
that is when we realise how wrong we were.

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:10.279
This Mercater projection is so wrong!

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:17.750
Along the Equator, it is to scale, but farther
you go above and below, you are grotesquely

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.750
skewing the size..

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:25.620
This map, on the other hand, shows you the
real way it should look!

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.060
Look at Greenland!

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.480
How small it actually is!

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.410
And, look at Australia!

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.920
That is the real size..

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:40.220
But, because it is being spread out.. a sphere
is being spread out into a rectangle, this

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.730
mis-shaped thing happens.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.810
America is much smaller!

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.759
This is Consistency Bias.

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:55.650
If a husband and wife are very happy now,
we would want to believe that they had always

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.650
been happy!

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.019
“Even from before we got married to each
other, you know!”

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:08.630
If they are not happy now, if they are fighting
too often, their memory will extend backwards,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:13.550
because of Consistency Bias, “Right from
Day One, we have been at loggerheads..

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.250
The talk was all about when we will head towards
Splitsville anyway..”

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.089
That is how the Consistency Bias shapes your
memory..

00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:25.400
That is another sin.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.950
The last sin, is Persistence.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.149
Remember that White Mandrill?

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:38.580
That white mandrill always kept coming to
the king, in his mind.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.780
And so, he could never drink the potion.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.040
And so, he couldn’t live forever.. and become
a guest at Quotidian.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.079
That is a problem!

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:54.980
We have memories that we WANT to forget!

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:01.190
But the more we want to forget it, the more
it becomes stronger.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.329
Do you see a Meteor Crater here?

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.669
A very large meteorite!

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:11.120
Around 70 million years ago..

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.850
Banged on to Earth with a wham!

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.660
And that is, The Gulf of Mexico.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.169
That crater is called Chicxulub.

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:29.680
That crater was the reason the dinosaurs died..

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:40.559
For tens of years, the atmosphere was a dark
cloud, vegetation died, all dinosaurs died

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.800
because there was no food to eat…

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:51.630
This mega monster.. rammed into the Earth,
but water has filled in, it has become the

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.950
Gulf of Mexico.. but that memory remains.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.470
Deep inside.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.250
The impact still remains.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.510
Similarly, these memories..

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:09.559
That first love rejection, that ‘just miss’
tragedy in that amazing success story you

00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:19.840
narrowly missed being part of, or the passing
away of a close friend or a close partner,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.730
… they remain as strong memories..

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.950
Too strong.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.610
That Persistence Bias..

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.570
How do we forget?

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:36.429
Why are some things so easy to remember but
so hard to forget, sometimes?

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:43.630
That is probably what we will try and see
in the next session, coming up in less than

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.630
24 hours!

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:49.590
So many sins…, isn’t there a deliverance
possible, from these?

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.450
We will see that tomorrow.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.850
But, a small closing thought before that.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:19:00.549
If you bring up the word memory, and look
for the person who did loads of research in

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:03.990
that subject, .. you will land on this guy.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.170
Who is he?

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.730
With this unique beard?

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.090
(Oh, by the way, that is a cue by itself.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.770
Look at his beard!)

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:17.590
Here is a trick I am going to use, to remember
this person’s name forever!

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:22.740
We have actually encountered this person once,
earlier too!

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.039
This is his house!

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.820
Along the sea’s edge..

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.480
Surf will kiss the doorway and recede..

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.830
The water will ebb.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.100
It won’t touch the house.. it will ebb.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.559
And his wife?

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:50.309
He remembers her birthday, her wedding day,
and also ensure he gives a special gift to

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:53.560
her on Valentine’s Day!

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.660
She is so happy!

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.550
And, her man… ebbing house..

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:05.830
That is his name!

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.210
Hermann Ebbinghaus!

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:18.150
Who lives in that house, silly house, near
the ebbing waters, whose wife, proudly proclaims

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.429
that this guy is her man!

00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:23.679
Let’s meet tomorrow!

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:32.779
Thank you!
