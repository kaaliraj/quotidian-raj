00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:03.929
Namaste!

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.760
Yesterday, we were looking at “Leave Silver,
Grab Gold”, weren’t we?!

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.540
In connection with that, a friend, a well-wisher,
a person who advises me a lot, (and, what

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.650
kind of advice?

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.600
Not the kind that I benefited from because
I followed, but the kind that if I hadn’t

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.030
followed properly during important milestones
of my life, I would have been “done for”!

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:39.220
Whenever she has advised me something and
I had chosen not to follow it, I have suffered

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.220
and struggled!)

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.140
She, gave me some feedback like this.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.320
You can limit your references to two or three
in each episode.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.380
You’re trying to pack too much.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.340
She went on to provide some supporting proof
too.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.579
Take a look at this, for example.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.640
In this story, you have brought in six sub-stories.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.809
You have talked about the Crystal Maze, you
have talked about a robot, you have mentioned

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.550
a cartoon, and then out comes a book!

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.220
Followed by Abraham Lincoln and a nameless
little girl.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.220
WHY??

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.770
Too much, she said.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.200
I thought about it, and a story came to mind.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.340
A story I had read in school.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.340
In Hindi.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.340
Titled “Ninyaanavey ke chakkar mein”.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.340
In the quest for the 99.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.530
Let me narrate the story to you briefly.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.530
There was this king.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.360
One day, he sees a merchant at his court,
a merchant who is seeming really happy and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.360
contented.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.360
So happy!

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.760
The king is all dull and depressed, while
the merchant is saying things like, “I am

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.440
happy, I am satisfied, a roof above my head,
food to eat, what I get is more than enough,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.480
let me sing a tune to celebrate it!”

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.159
So, the king asked, “How do we get this
guy’s happiness?

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.479
Why is this guy happy?

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.940
Why am I not happy?”

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.460
The minister who was observing this from a
corner, proposed a trick.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.559
There is no mystery here, let me just place
a bag filled with exactly ninety-nine gold

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:14.419
coins in his front porch tomorrow..

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.750
just ninety-nine gold coins.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.629
And, see what happens.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.469
“How will that solve anything?”

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.579
wondered the king.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.769
“Just wait and watch”, said the minister.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.999
What happened?

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:33.219
Well, this merchant saw that gold bag, he
thought it was a gift from God, a gift from

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.370
somebody, and he started counting it.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.449
He counted ninety-nine in the bag.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.010
Who would gift anybody ninety-nine gold coins…

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.150
It has to be a hundred..

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.450
Where is that missing coin…

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.459
And he started searching for it.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.799
He didn’t get it.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.419
Deciding to round off the number, becoming
obsessed about that quest, succumbing to greed,

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.010
working harder, aiming to make hundred into
a thousand, a thousand into a ten thousand,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:04.089
he ended up trapping himself in the vicious
cycle, the rat race, the Wheel of Life.

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.659
He too ended up unhappy, just like the king!

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.140
The quest for the missing piece.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.870
That was the crux of that story from my childhood.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.469
In Tamil, the proverb “Podhum endra manamey
pon seyyum marundhu” — (It is golden to

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:16.469
be mature enough to say enough!)

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.040
— If you get caught in the 99 club, it is
going to be pretty hard from then on!

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.040
But, hang on!

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.959
I want to turn the tables on this one.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.469
If I give you ninety-nine, the quest that
you go on, to make it a complete hundred,

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:39.519
is really exhilarating both for me and for
you.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:49.180
The way I see it, it is almost as if I am
giving you a book but I am tearing a page

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.960
from the final chapter before giving it to
you!

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.669
I have done this in my childhood.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:04:01.659
Whenever I see a torn page, I have tried completing
the sentences, letting my imagination run

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.900
wild, guessing what the story could have been,
think creatively.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.719
That is exactly what I hope you would be doing
too!

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.859
So, my job?

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.889
Is just to light a thousand sparks and sprinkle
it all around!

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.439
Where do they all land?

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.000
What towering conflagrations they create?!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.039
Everything depends on that little spark and
the kindle-readiness that you are willing

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.780
to demonstrate!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.449
That is how I see it.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.310
Let me show you an example.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.310
Remember?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.639
We talked about the Day of the Jackal?

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.639
The book?

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.030
One person said, oh, okay, I haven’t heard
of this book, I should add it to my reading

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.030
list!

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.159
Another seems to have read the book with great
attention to detail, seems to be a big fan

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:49.490
too, and he found a mistake in what I had
said and went ahead to correct me!

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.189
He pointed out that the protagonist fails
in his objective at the last moment…

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:53.189
I would want to agree.

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.189
Yes.

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.610
From my perspective, did I tell you whether
the bullet reached its destination?

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.110
Assassinated the intended victim?

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.059
No, I didn’t tell you that.

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.091
I just raised your interest in it.

00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:04.810
Mentioned that it was an amazing book.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.120
But, left it dangling there.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.560
In the hope that somebody would buy it, read
it, that was my intent.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.560
That is enough for me.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.039
I remember talking to you about the Crystal
Maze.

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.740
One person told me that he had never watched
such a program.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.180
I never knew..

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.439
This seems interesting though, he said.

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.069
Another told me that this was her favourite
program!

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.650
Particularly the host who used to be featured
in earlier seasons, a shaved-head guy who

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.849
resembled the Onida man!

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.889
It was interesting to read all this feedback.

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.669
but, the best of them all?

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.550
A sixty-year-old grandpa responded to my observation
about sharpening the saw.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.349
He told me that he was reminded of his teacher
who asked him — what would you sharpen to

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:37.349
cut wood?

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.349
Your intellect?

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.349
Or the saw?!

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:40.349
He is sixty years old.

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.349
And, he is reminded of his school-teacher!

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.419
He thanked me for taking him down memory lane!

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.340
I felt really happy!

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.220
And, that’s why I do this.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.600
That’s just why I do this!

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.680
So, welcome to the 99 club!

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.180
I am not going to spoon-feed you anything.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.020
I am just going to light a thousand sparks.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.860
To light one up, to start to burn, to pass
the fire onwards, is all up to you!

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.650
That is how I see it.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.819
Entry fee is Zero!

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.060
You pay for it, all your life!

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.620
That is perhaps how you should take it!

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.810
I am assuming she would accept this line of
thought.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.330
I am assuming she has understood where I am
coming from.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.970
Thank you!
