00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.159
App Developer Raj:- Isn’t it AMMAAAZING??!

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.740
App Tester Raj:- It has to be amazing, is
it??

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.780
App Developer Raj:- No, I mean, I just wanted
to know if you liked it…

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.780
App Tester Raj:- What do you mean?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.780
I am supposed to like it, eh??

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.849
App Developer Raj:- … What do you feel?!

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.339
App Tester Raj:- Feel?

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:26.630
Where on earth are you bringing those things
from?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.730
Feelings?

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:45.489
Are we watching a movie here, or what??

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.590
Namaste!

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.030
Four Hundred and Thirty One!

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.570
“Do you like it?”

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.840
is the question.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.399
But, “Do you like it?”

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.309
shouldn’t be the question.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.350
How to solicit user feedback, that is what
we are going to talk about today.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.490
What is User Experience?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.100
What is Usability?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.479
If you look for the definition, it would run
something like this.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.350
“The extend to which a product can be used
by specified users to achieve specific goals

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.810
with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction
in a specified context of use!”

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.960
If we dwell in some more detail on the key
words in this definition, first up, Users:

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.000
Anybody can be a user, but who are you preparing
this for… don’t try to please everybody,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.190
don’t try to build something that’ll be
suitable for everybody, you’ll end up building

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.440
something that’s not LOVED by anybody..

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.680
So, target specific users.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.229
Then, Goals: What are we trying to help them
achieve?

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.159
Are you going to tell them they can achieve
ANYTHING THEY WANT with this?

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.439
That won’t work!

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.780
There should be some things your product won’t
do.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.929
Only then, you can target it at some things
it will do very well.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.629
Similarly, we have to be Effective: I spent
this much time and this much money..

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.890
I couldn’t have done this well with any
other tool.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.190
It should be effective.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.110
Easy.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.040
Understandable.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.550
Not causing any kind of difficulty for me
in any form.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.880
Effective.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.160
Also, it should be Efficient: Minimising costs,
minimising energy consumed, minimising the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.629
imprint, the carbon footprint perhaps, that
is efficient.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.569
Finally, Satisfaction: It is pretty hard to
measure it..

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.260
They also call it Delight.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.580
That complete satisfaction, fulfilment they
call it.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.440
You can’t enquire and find out.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.180
You may not also be able to understand it
by watching.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.480
Perhaps you have to do this by befriending
and habituating only!

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.989
Google gifted us with a framework.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.569
A beautiful framework, and a beautiful acronym
to go along with it too!

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.640
Are you looking for feedback from the user?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.379
Use the HEART!

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.290
What does this HEART stand for?

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.200
First, H stands for Happiness.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:44.110
Are they just satisfied that they got the
job done, or is there a hint of joy, a sense

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.070
of delight, a blooming, a blossoming…

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.970
Is there that little thing..

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.319
it has happened to me many times, am sure
it has happened to you too..

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.189
You would be reading a book, and then, suddenly,
you’d STEP OUT of the story and soliloquise..

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.280
“Wow, what a beautiful plot twist that was,
by the author!”

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.819
Have you had that experience?!

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.550
Similarly, you may be eating something..

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.120
You will jump out of the dish that you are
eating, and you would get into the mind of

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.360
the person who cooked it..

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.150
That jump is probably a great indication of
Happiness..

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.820
When you go, “This piece of software, wow,
what a brainwave by Steve Jobs!”, that is

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.100
Happiness.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.130
H. E stands for Engagement.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.130
What is Engagement?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.560
Once you start using it, you get immersed
into it.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.210
You want to have a private conversation with
that thing in front of you.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.350
Could be a product, could be a book, could
be a movie, could be a dish you are eating,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.350
but…

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.350
Engaged.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.350
I am not distracted.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.880
I am not doing ten things and this is the
eleventh one.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.760
I am Engaged.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760
A.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.220
A stands for Adoption.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.060
Okay..

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.090
This seems new.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.570
I was using something else till now.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.410
I will start using this from now on.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.080
This ALSO from now on.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.380
When you say that, you are adopting.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.680
You are probably changing some habits.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.650
And you are being inclusive.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.380
You invite this thing into your inner circle.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.190
That is A. Adoption.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.190
That leads us to R. R would be Retention.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.500
You took me in.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.759
You liked me so much that you let the older
relationship go!

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.160
You say “I don’t need you anymore because
I have got something far better!”

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.539
So, that would be Retention.

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:52.069
And finally, here is something that is fundamental
to all these others, is Task Success.

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.509
Why did you come here?

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.509
To achieve something.

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.270
To get something done.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.280
Are you able to complete it 100%? Or, did
you need something else?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.509
Or did you find something lacking?

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.440
That is Task Success.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.789
You came here to do something.

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:20.180
Are you able to achieve that one hundred percent
successfully?

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.180
HEART.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.370
This lady, her name is Abby Covert.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.419
She has written a book.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.660
Two books actually.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.880
The first one is called “How to make sense
of any mess”.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.229
What a name, eh?!

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:40.449
But, hey.. when talking about appropriateness
of names, what a name.. “Covert”..

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.180
See the meaning of that word.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:51.940
A usability expert, a user experience specialist,
an information architect, .. would such a

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.230
person name themselves COVERT??

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.560
Anyway…

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:08.410
If you go to the fifth chapter of this book,
it talks about getting user feedback and gives

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:18.720
you eighteen, EIGHTEEN, different ways you
have to be alert and aware to receive proper

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.910
user feedback!

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:27.660
You please spend some time, the book is free,
available online, .. but I would like to underline

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.150
just three of them which were.. kinda interesting!

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.690
The first one is Murk.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:45.950
She says, “You built this product or cooked
this dish or wrote this book or whatever for

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.950
something..

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.590
To achieve some end goal.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.570
Are users confused, about what else it can
do?

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.710
They call it Ekagra Chinthana.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.440
Focused on just one thing.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:10.949
Instead of that, hinting at capability in
other domains too, is there a sense of murkiness

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:13.389
to your offering?

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:15.009
Check that!”

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:17.590
The other thing she highlights is Competition.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:22.280
Are there many others doing the same thing
the same way just like you?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.569
That would lead to murkiness too.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.139
“Why should I use this product?

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.720
The same thing is possible with that other
product too..”

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.310
If Yahoo and Google were similar directories,
Google wouldn’t have become famous.

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:40.709
When there were forty other search engines
doing the same thing, listing stuff as directories,

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:48.930
along came Google, showed nothing on screen,
just a box asking you “Are you feeling lucky?”..

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.050
That… is differentiation!

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.430
That differentiation is important.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.610
So, look at what competition does.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:03.260
And, another interesting thing she says is
Backlash.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.490
You claim your product lets people do something.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.390
Do they make a mistake with your product?

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:20.060
Some accident, some unexpected screwups, what
kind of things can go wrong?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.600
Because your product is not easily understandable,
because your users are… idiots..

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.730
But, still, is your product accident-proof?

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.060
Without complaints, without backlash?

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.220
Check that!

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.220
Interesting!

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.290
She has listed eighteen such items.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.610
Go, check them out!

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.690
But, I am going to take you elsewhere..

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:48.790
When we talk about Feedback, when we talk
about listening to our users, and about helping

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:54.959
them, … we can go to the animal kingdom
itself!

00:09:54.959 --> 00:10:03.100
Most birds, when they feed their chicks, they
regurgitate the food..

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:09.950
The stuff that they ate just a while ago,
half-digested, they bring it back as a friendlier

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:18.210
goo and offer it to the chicks.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.210
Pampering!

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.459
That’s how the bird first tastes food!

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:26.380
Have you seen mothers offer bottle-milk to
the baby?

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.019
They sprinkle a few drops of the milk on to
the inside of their wrists!

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:32.610
I asked my sister about it..

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.639
Why on earth did she do it!?

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:38.670
That’s when she explained it to me…

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:44.829
If it is too hot, the child won’t be able
to express it in words, it would just cry,

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:47.560
… what if it scalded the tongue, the tender
lips..?

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:56.610
So, this is probably the only place in MY
body which is closest in sensitivity to the

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.540
baby’s tender skin!

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.540
Wow!

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:07.940
We have read about Dogfooding, and this is
like the next level of Dogfooding!

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.930
Do you remember this story in The Ramayana?

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.930
Shabari..

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.649
That old lady offers berries to Lord Rama.

00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:22.780
On his way into the jungle, … berries from
the old lady.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:27.890
But, she doesn’t just offer a bunch to the
Lord.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:37.620
She picks the best ones, the ones without
worms, the ones that are, ripe, perfect, and

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.650
how?

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:53.189
She bites into them, tests them, tastes them,
finalises, decides, and only then offers!

00:11:53.189 --> 00:11:56.990
Next level “taking care of the user”..

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.170
Don’t you agree?!

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.410
Onam is a festival.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.950
A big deal in Kerala.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:08.950
Mahabali reappears from underground.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.950
Connected with the Vamana Avatar.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:18.550
And, every year that he reappears, they celebrate
his arrival, they worship him, it is a Harvest

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.550
Festival of sorts.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:26.589
And, one of the highlights of the festival
is Onam Sadhya.

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:28.540
The big feast!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.540
Amazing feast!

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.190
You can zoom in and look at the details of
every dish out here.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:42.350
This is exactly how the traditional South
Indian plantain leaf lunch is served.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.829
At my home too!

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:56.190
My Grandma had very specific advice to my
mom about what the woman should do when serving

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.019
such a lunch.

00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:01.180
And, what was that?

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.300
Watch and Learn.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.260
You cooked this stuff?

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.160
You think your work is done with that?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.160
Nope!

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.160
Go, serve it!

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.360
And, after serving, watch!

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.170
Watch from the kitchen doorway.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.470
See what He likes!

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.410
See what He needs more of!

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.040
See what He avoids eating…

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:27.560
See what He tastes and crinkles up his eyebrows
and turns up His nose because He doesn’t

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.810
like the taste..

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:37.100
Because these are powerful indicators for
what worked out for you today in the kitchen!

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.500
Watch, and Learn!

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:45.440
And then, my Grandma would tell us the advice
that she received from HER mother!

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.940
You know what my Great Grandma told my Grandma?!

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.550
Eat in the same plate!

00:13:53.550 --> 00:14:01.550
That is, the Husband will eat something in
a plate, a silver plate, and this Grandma

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:06.980
lady has to wait for Him to finish so that
the same plate can be used, it seems.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.149
Why?

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:13.040
She can immediately get feedback about what
the Man didn’t like..

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.190
What the Man left half-eaten..!

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.670
Feedback, apparently!

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.670
User..

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.670
Customer..

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.670
Feedback!

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.040
Watch.. and Learn!

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.480
But, we go to Jeyamohan.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.250
He gives a beautiful twist.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.500
In the fourteenth book of The Mahabharata.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.209
We have often returned to this fount of wisdom.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.109
The same series of books.

00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:45.040
The fourteenth book is the one that talks
about the one-year incognito time.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.649
When the Pancha Pandavas don’t move around
the Pancha Pandavas..

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:56.120
They don different names, roles, attire, and
merge into the crowd in the kingdom.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.360
During that time, Arjuna is a dance teacher…

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.399
Bhima?

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:04.399
Is in the kitchen.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.760
He is a master-chef.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:18.560
At this time, when Bhima is in the kitchen,
they are narrated the story of Nala and Damayanthi.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.779
A famous king and his beautiful and powerful
queen.

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:28.100
They have similar backgrounds, both are amazing
cooks.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.940
They cook so well!

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.089
In fact, Nala wrote a full book it seems..

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:40.750
That book is named Paaka Darpana.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.899
Nala Paakam, they often say.

00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:44.290
Darpana is mirror.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.870
An old man is talking to Bhima, who has just
finished cooking.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:56.579
And, as Bhima is about to go serve the food,
the old man stays his hand and says, “The

00:15:56.579 --> 00:16:00.769
tradition is different here.

00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:04.490
The ones who serve are different from the
ones who cook.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:15.750
That those who cook shouldn’t serve too,
is one of the precepts laid down by King Nala!”.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:21.230
And, Bhima immediately asks back, “Why so?!”

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.230
Look at the answers!

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:33.610
“The guy who has finished cooking would
be feeling top of the world.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.630
He has done it.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.630
He has achieved it.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:41.079
He has… he has performed chemical magic!

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:44.310
The person who is eating need not feel the
same.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.190
He may be hungry.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.829
He may NOT be hungry.

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:54.509
They may have various backgrounds, and hence
their tastes, their appreciations will vary.

00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:55.589
Won’t they?!

00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:58.610
Each a different type, at every moment a different
quality.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.800
Changing all the time.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:07.809
And so, it is possible that the person who
cooked might get angry at the person who is

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:08.809
eating..

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:13.779
He might end up thinking that all the effort
that he had put in the cooking is going unrecognised..

00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:17.709
The place one keeps a certain dish on the
leaf, the sequence in which they eat the dishes,

00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:23.380
… may all become trigger points for the
cook to fulminate!

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:31.160
The person who cooked should not watch the
terror and the horror that is happening on

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.840
the plantain leaf.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:41.300
Each person may eat it in a different style!

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.669
Leave it to them!

00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:51.110
You may be justified in that anger but that
doesn’t mean you can do this when serving.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.429
You should do it with a smiling face always!”

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:58.280
There is one more reason, the old man tells
Bhima.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.220
And that is…

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.330
“Nothing is a one man job.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.010
It is a teamwork.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.510
You may have cooked something, something else
may have been cooked by somebody else, but

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:18.360
when you are serving, without consciously
realising it, you may add a little more of

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.820
what you did, hoping they would give feedback…

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.770
“Do you like this dish?!

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.650
Shall I serve you one more Mysurpa!”

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.971
That is not good manners either!

00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:36.240
The person who is a specialist server, he
is going to treat all dishes equally..

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.240
all dishes as if he cooked each and every
one of them!

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.370
And that is how it SHOULD be served!

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:52.690
Basically, a great case for having a separate
tester in every team!

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:57.299
A separate usability engineer in every team!

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:03.750
If the developer herself does the usability
testing, if the designer herself plans the

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:10.350
user experience, … it would end up like
Bhima’s story!

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.350
Beware!

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:17.730
By the way, talking about the bird and regurgitation,
I was reminded of this too..!

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.960
There are two words in English — one is
PAMPER.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.390
Go ahead, please pamper.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:28.820
Shower love and affection.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.970
Treat them as kings and queens.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.760
Go the extra mile for your customers.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.929
Praise them.

00:19:38.929 --> 00:19:41.270
Take care of them.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.440
No problem.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.200
Please do that!

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:50.110
But, there is another word in English — Don’t
PANDER.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:58.730
Pander is to gratify or indulge an immoral
or distasteful desire!

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:08.870
Whatever base, low level, cheap, vulgar desires
are asked of you, to go ahead and fulfil them!

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.059
Never do that.

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:16.440
Watch this video a friend shared with me on
Whatsapp.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.470
Pandering to the chick again and again, see
what the mother-bird has wrought!

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.289
See what the chick does!

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:42.980
“It is enough to just stand next to it,
the food will automatically come into the

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.170
mouth!”, the chick seems to think!

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:51.309
“All I need to do is to open my mouth wide!”..

00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:54.190
It hasn’t learned the ways of the world!

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.630
Don’t do that to your users..

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.380
They call it tough love!

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:05.260
We will address this in one of our future
episodes.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.830
Tough love is what you need to practise!

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.100
Thank you!

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:20.280
We will meet again soon!
