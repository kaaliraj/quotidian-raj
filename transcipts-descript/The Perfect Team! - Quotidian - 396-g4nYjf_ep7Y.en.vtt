00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:16.700
This man, a "just another good player" of
the Mumbai Indians team… how.. how did he

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:28.880
become the captain, the winning captain of
Gujarat Titans? What is the actual formula

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:50.620
for winning teams? Shall we take a look?
Namaste!

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.569
How did Hardik Pandya, the "just another good
player", become the winning captain? The answer

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:07.990
to that question, I think, lies in the team,
and its composition. That is what this lady

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:18.240
thought too. Her name is Julia Rozovsky. She
is a Yale graduate, and she worked at Google

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.770
for many many years. One of the most important
contributions she made at Google was called

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.360
Project Aristotle. Whaaat? Why Aristotle here?
Is that what you are thinking? Well, it was

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.600
Aristotle who contributed this most interesting
quote. This is what he said. We have heard

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.039
of this one before, but perhaps, now, we learn
that it was he who contributed this to the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.369
world first! "The whole is actually greater
than the sum of its parts". If you bring two

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.469
and two together, to think the answer will
always be four is… wrong! Could be five!

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:02.109
Wait.. Could even be twenty-two. It is in
how they come together! That is what really

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:10.729
matters! So, they called it Project Aristotle,
and they did a multi-year research on what

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:21.319
kind of teams exist, do they perform very
well, what makes them perform well, what are

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:30.760
the common characteristics among teams that
are excellent, and so on.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.200
Before getting into the results of the research
I want to distinguish between a Workgroup

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:47.980
and a Team here. In a Workgroup, the interdependence
is minimal. I do my work. You do yours. Just

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.420
get the work done, and get a move on. The
hierarchy is very clearly laid out. You can't,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.390
just like that, go and interact with somebody,
do a joint project with somebody else, and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.439
so on. And, meetings are all well-aligned,
regular, scheduled, timely, with an agenda,

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:13.030
who is supposed to speak what, what decisions,
etc… That is a Workgroup. It is focused

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:22.560
on a particular delivery being done.&nbsp;
On the other hand, a Team is dependent on

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:32.380
a lot of interaction. Everything is interconnected.
It is almost as if nobody can do their work

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:41.439
without everybody else contributing! It is
cohesive! And that structure is called a Team.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:55.079
While Workgroups are Results-oriented, Goals-oriented,
here, the Teams are actually focused and oriented

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:03.670
on Team Synergy. And, over time, one thing
we have all realised is, when you work and

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:12.840
perform as a team, you tend to innovate faster,
you see mistakes, made by yourself, made by

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.090
others, more quickly, and actually, you are
able to find better solutions faster.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.090
Workgroups and Teams - if you were to
look at a sports analogy for this whole thing,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.400
you would say a Workgroup is like a Tennis
team… Remember The Davis Cup, for example?

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.400
A will play with B. C will play with D. A
will play with D. C will play with B. That's

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.990
it. When I am in the tennis court, I am an
individual doing my own thing, and I have

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.139
to win.. And I win or lose based on my abilities.
That is not the case with a game like football

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:01.639
or basketball. Over there, there is a team
orchestration. Everybody has to depend on

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:09.350
everybody else for anybody to think of winning.
That is where the beauty lies. If we were

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.310
to take an example company, we saw Creative
Selection by Ken Kocienda. The repeated refrain

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.960
in that book is that they were actually working
in airtight silos. They were Workgroups. "This

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.490
is me. This is my work. And that's all that
matters. Sometimes, we couldn't even let others

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.740
know what we were working on!" If you were
to take a counter-example, my company, Zoho

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.250
Corp, is a team-driven company. Everything
is interconnected with everything else. Beautifully

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:54.510
orchestrated, almost like a symphony!
That lady, Julia, before telling us what WORKS,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:02.940
she also lays out what doesn't really matter.
You want a good team structure? You want a

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.420
long-sustained life for your team? You don't
need to bother about these, for that - she

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:14.849
lays out very clearly. What are those? Well,
here is one that is extra-important because

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:33.139
of the current Covid situation. Should we
all be in the same location? Should we all

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.680
come to office?? No. Not needed. Should all
be outspoken? Straightforward? Gossippy? Talkative?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.440
Jocular? Extroverted? No! Not needed! Do we
need superstars? One or two top performers?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.310
Will the team somehow grow and prosper around
them? No! Not needed! Seniority? Do we need

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.009
golden oldies who have been there, done that?
Who have seen it all? No! Not needed! And,

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:02.010
does team size matter? Will a team be cohesive
only if it is less than twenty people? Remember

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:08.300
that Two-Pizza rule by Jeff Bezos we have
encountered before? Is a large team bound

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:21.610
to collapse and eventually die? No! Not again!
Finally, does workload matter? Will the pressure

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.590
at work have a negative impact? This is actually
a surprising discovery. The kind of work you

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:34.090
do, the workload does not matter, when you
are talking about the perfect team composition,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:41.280
and long-lasting team happiness.
Well, what matters then? She gives us five

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.099
beautiful answers.&nbsp;
Number One is Psychological Safety! What is

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:53.030
Psychological Safety? Well, it will be immediately
apparent, the moment you see this picture.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:02.430
In 2020, RCB had sacked their batting coach
and their bowling coach. Do you think that

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:11.870
was the right decision? Do you think RCB won
in '21 and '22? Wait.. Do you know where Nehra

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:20.080
and Kirsten are today? They are the bowling
coach and the batting coach of Gujarat Titans!

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:29.879
Do you get the irony? So, when you are part
of a team, you need to have the confidence

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:38.230
and the courage to take a risk! You need the
rights to "bungle" and "screw up madly". If

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.930
you accept your mistake, there shouldn't be
any punishment for it! If you offer a silly

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:52.000
idea, it should still be acknowledged, even
if it is not welcomed! It is okay to seem

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.800
ignorant, nobody is going to mock at you with
"Don't you know even this simple matter?!"

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:03.950
Those form psychological safety! And that
is such an important ingredient, according

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:10.730
to that research!
Numer Two is Dependability. What is Dependability?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:20.620
Every time, consistently, high quality work,
in a timely manner,&nbsp;… if everybody has

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.750
the sense to do work this way, you have it
made! They should all have that sense deeply

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:36.040
ingrained in them. Reliable. Complete. High
quality work. On time. Yesterday, I was having

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.340
a chat with one of my colleagues. Look at
our "chemistry". I asked him about a summarised

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:48.630
report that I wanted… by 4 PM today. And,
he responded with "Done!" It was 2 PM then.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:57.430
I had given that work just then. I was shocked!
"Wow! Already? That's amazing! Send it over!"

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:03.740
I exclaimed. And that's when the cat was let
out of the bag… "I meant 'consider it done'…

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:10.480
(Just assume that it will be done soon!)"
Here I am. Already on the job. Will be ready

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:19.640
soon". So, this understanding.. The meaning
of the word "Dependable" comes only over time.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:26.430
Comes only when you deliver, reliably, on
time, high quality. If you bring that about,

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:36.660
you near perfection a bit more!
Number Three is Structure and Clarity. Structure

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.670
is all about who do you report to, who do
you work with, who works for you, the hierarchical

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:49.830
structure… And beyond that, Clarity is about
"What is my role here, What is expected out

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:58.040
of me, How do I fulfil them? What are the
consequences if I fulfil? If I don't fulfil?

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.080
What are the goals?" Are these clear to every
individual in the team? This is a question

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:09.010
you need to keep asking your team, at least
once in a while. You cannot assume people

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:14.820
already know. That they would ask if they
are in doubt. The reason I used this picture

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.850
from the Second World War is pretty simple.
This is from the Pearl Harbour Bombing. A

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:27.150
very important moment in World War II. America
was not part of the war yet, and Japan bombed

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:39.170
Pearl Harbour and won a little battle… but
it lost the war. It woke up a sleeping giant…

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:45.860
The United States.. without having any idea
how formidable an opponent it was.. and got

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.270
thrashed. Why? Structure and Clarity were
missing. They didn't have an understanding

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.840
of what was expected of them. They didn't
have to win the battle.. They had to win the

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:04.310
war.&nbsp;
Number Four is the question that faces probably

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:13.280
every teenager who is about to enter the workforce
today. What's in it for me? Why should I do

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:21.750
this? That existential question. I have used
the picture of a greyhound chasing a rabbit.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:32.400
There is an Aesop Fable about this too. The
story goes that the hound is chasing the rabbit

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.670
and two people are commenting? - Do you
think the hound will win? Do you think the

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.480
rabbit will win? - The hound's supporter
and friend shouts - "The hound will win!

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.700
Of course! Of course!" - To which, a person
who knows the rabbit only too well, quips,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:56.870
"No way the hound is going to win. Because,
the hound is doing it considering it a job…

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:05.570
its master has asked it to chase, and it is
chasing. What about the rabbit? The rabbit

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:14.740
is running for its life! Do you think the
hound will ever win? No way!" This is it!

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:23.400
What is your sense of purpose? What motivates
you? What is the meaning of your work? Are

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.500
you doing it for the pay? Are you doing it
to take care of your family? Are you doing

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:34.660
it for personal fame? Or, are you here to
scratch a personal itch? Or, are you trying

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:40.430
to bring about lasting social change and societal
transformation!? That question! We need to

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:48.490
help our team members answer that question
and that's how you get closer to perfection.&nbsp;

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:54.890
Finally, What is the impact?! This is the
classic photograph featuring Sculley, John

00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:03.240
Sculley, and Steve Jobs. John Sculley was
the CEO of Pepsi at that time. Steve Jobs

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.480
approached him, told him that Apple was poised
to become a world-class company, implored

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.360
him to come over! "Let's change the world,
join us!" - he encouraged! But, Sculley

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.900
was two-minded… He felt he was all settled
at Pepsi already, to which Steve Jobs is famously

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.550
known to have closed the historic deal with
"Do you want to continue selling sugared water

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:31.670
for the rest of your life, or do you want
to join me and make a dent in the universe?!

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:37.890
We will change the world, come, here is an
opportunity like never before!" - He is

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:45.460
supposed to have said thus, or at least the
myth or story says so. Making a difference.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.750
Beyond my own circle… My benefits. My job.
My career. My calling.. We have seen "Start

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:55.010
With Why" and its importance already. What
is that Why? And, is what I am doing going

00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:01.020
beyond just helping me get better? Is it making
the organisation reach its goals? Beyond organisational

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:09.600
goals, does it help the society reach its
goals? That alignment, if you can get that

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:17.870
done, you are part of an amazing team.
Interesting thing she does, this lady, she

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:23.680
talks about something called Average Social
Sensitivity. For a team manager, or even for

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.930
the members of the team, there has to be this
thing called Average Social Sensitivity. What

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:38.810
is that? From a person's tone of voice, from
a person's expressions, from their nonverbal

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:47.360
cues, can we find out if that person is upset?
If that person is feeling left out? Can you

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:54.040
detect it? They also give an interesting test
for that, and I found out that this test is

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.750
available for free online! It is called the
"Reading The Mind In The Eyes" Test. Just

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:05.380
by looking at the eyes, can you guess what
they are thinking? What they are feeling?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:13.980
I have created a short URL for you. Visit
https://bit.ly/mindeyes and take the test!

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.510
It might take a max of fifteen minutes.&nbsp;
This is how the test is going to look. You

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:24.870
will be shown "eyes". And you'll have to find
out. What the person is actually feeling.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:33.680
Are they playful? Are they comforting? Are
they bored or irritated?! In this case, they

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.580
are Playful.&nbsp;
Are they joking? Or, are they flustered? Or,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:45.270
are they convinced? Or, is there desire in
the eyes? In this case, there is desire in

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.550
the eyes.&nbsp;
It goes on. About thirty-six questions, one

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:56.310
after the other. I got thirty-three out of
thirty-six, and they claim it is a good score!

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:03.110
You take your score, and tell me how you did!
Because, it seems you will be good at understanding

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:10.650
someone's mental state based on facial cues,
and if you do that well, you can be part of

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:17.840
an amazing team, you can lead a team into
success and greatness.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:34.020
Okay…! Closing thought?! Nothing else. I
am just going to do that! And, tell me? What

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:44.770
my current emotion is?! We will meet again,
on June 4th. Thank you!
