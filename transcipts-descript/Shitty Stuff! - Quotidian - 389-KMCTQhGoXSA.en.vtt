00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:14.220
Let the fragrance spread far and wide. Have
you had your food yet? Oh, you are going to

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.090
eat only now? Careful… Today's topic is
kinda…. Well, all I can say is, this is

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.779
not a program you can watch "while you are
eating". You've been warned! That's all I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:48.760
can tell you! Let's get shit done!
Namaste!&nbsp;

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.910
A few months ago, I came across this content
creator on YouTube. Ankur Warikoo is his name.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:06.520
A Kashmiri. An entrepreneur. An author. A
speaker. He has written a book called "Do

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:17.189
Epic Shit". Very interesting. I finished reading
it over the weekend. And,&nbsp;… I would strongly

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:26.000
recommend not only his book but also his YouTube
videos, his Twitter channel, if you are interested

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.490
in learning from other people's mistakes.&nbsp;
In fact, this is the Table of Contents. About

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.960
Success (and Failure too), Habits, Awareness,
Entrepreneurship, Money, and Relationships.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:48.950
This is what he has talked about in that book.
It is almost a random collection of tweets

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.760
and posts and other articles he has written
over the past ten years perhaps.. He and his

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:07.159
team have put it all together and made it
a book. A bit repetitive… And, occasionally,

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.660
there seems to be no beginning, no end, no
connection, no continuity. Sometimes…&nbsp;

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.420
But, I kept looking. That word "Shit"… he
has used it in the cover, pretty boldly. I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.620
searched for it inside the book. For that
word or phrase. Surprisingly, strangely, almost

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.459
zero occurrences of that term. Yes, he talks
about how he got things done, he gives advice

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.420
on how to set goals, how to actually think
about habits and not goals, a lot of advice

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.170
like that. But, he hasn't used that word inside
that book.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.750
He also tells us, in the foreword itself,
that his book is like a "Book Cricket" book.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.810
Do you remember how you used to play that
game? Sitting in the last bench at school?

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.500
Take any random book, flip to a random page,
sum the digits of the page number, and that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.209
determines whether your virtual batsman gets
runs or gets out! He claims this book to be

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.620
one such book! Jump to any page, on any day!
It is almost like "Shitting"! Once a day!

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.720
Go to any page, and, read, understand, imbibe,
implement.&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:36.230
I remember another book that does the exact
same thing. It is by Richard Bach, and we

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.260
have met him earlier too, when we talked about
Jonathan Livingston Seagull, the bird story.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.930
This is another book by him, titled Illusions.
He talks about a book inside this book. That

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.409
the hero goes around, toting like a diary.
In his hand. And, whenever he is stuck, whenever

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.090
he is in a dilemma, he just goes to that book
and opens a random page, and there, would

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.319
like the answer he is looking for! That would
be the interesting movement described in that

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.691
book.
They say this even about The Bible! On the

00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:23.160
other hand, in a Church, a priest who had
researched the scriptures quite well, once

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.940
quipped… The Holy Bible is to be read, analysed,
and pondered over deeply, from the start to

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.520
the end. It is such a book. Don't go in search
of random messages. He gave an example too,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.090
from the Bible itself. For example, you may
jump to Matthew 27:5. And, immediately you

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.270
may be taken to Luke 10:37. Guess what would
happen then? In Matthew 27:5, Judas throws

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:59.660
away the silver pieces and hangs himself to
death… And, in Luke 10:37, the verse goes

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.780
"Do likewise!" "You also should do likewise!" - A
passage, really with no connection whatsoever

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.370
to Matthew 27:5. Is this a good message. So,
the Bible is not to be read like that is my

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:23.250
simple, humble recommendation.&nbsp;
Coming back to this book, one amazing thing

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:31.680
that I really loved about the Do Epic Shit
book was the Failure Resume. He talks a lot

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.900
about the mistakes he made in his twenties,
and in his thirties, about money, about relationships,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.990
about time, and he says, these are the lessons
I learned. And, he publishes something called

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.380
his Failure Resume. These are not my achievements.
These are not the things that I am really

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.560
proud of. These are things I am ashamed of.
These are things I goofed up in. These are

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.970
things that I made terrible mistakes with.
But, these are the lessons I learned alongside!

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.850
I failed.. I learned. I failed… I learned.
I failed… I learned. Goes his resume. It

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:16.660
was so interesting! I am going to recommend
to all my juniors to actually come up with

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.509
a Failure Resume. If your Failure Resume is
empty, something is wrong somewhere. You haven't

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.830
probably been trying hard enough. Experimenting
enough. Innovating enough.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:38.600
Okay, alright, is there something we can share,
about Shit, in true Quotidian Style? I wondered.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.210
I went rummaging into my archives. I came
up with three. Here is the first one.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:51.800
We have addressed this quite some time ago.
Where, knowledge is for Sharing. And not for

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:59.340
Hoarding. And as an example, and as a simile,
we had seen the phrase "Knowledge is like

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:07.640
Cow Dung". If you pack it, all the way to
the ceiling, inside a closed room, it will

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:21.330
stink to high heaven! On the other hand, if
you spread it far and wide, knowledge, cow

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:32.569
dung, it becomes manure! Useful for everybody,
including you! So, knowledge and Cow Shit!

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:40.880
Okay, what is the second shit we are talking
about? The second one is a beautiful story

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:53.200
my aunt used to give me. She lived in Mumbai.
And this aunt told me… The definition, the

00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:01.349
defining characteristics of an idiot, is just
this: The fool gets shit in three places!

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:11.699
Whaaat? What would that mean? An idiot, walking,
steps on shit. See what happens.

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:22.970
Alright. He has got it on his foot.
Ouch. He has got it on his fingers!

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:35.830
Ouch. He has got it on his nose!!
Yes, of course, one needs to be curious. But,

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:43.649
morbid curiosity? With no rational thought
behind it? You step on something… Wanting

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:49.430
to know what it is, you will take it on to
your fingers, wanting to know what it is you

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:55.630
will take it to your nose? And you will get
it on your nose?? A fool. Gets it in three

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:04.680
places. Rather than one. Interesting, nah?
The third piece of shit that we are going

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:12.290
to talk about today, is from this movie. Based
on a book by Agatha Christie, called the Murder

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:20.390
On The Orient Express. Hercule Poirot. An
amazing detective. The world's most famous

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:27.830
detective! That is whom this book is about.
In this cinematic rendering of the story,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:37.250
Hercule Poirot is walking, and he steps on
to something. See what happens. See how Zen

00:09:37.250 --> 00:10:11.630
his approach is!
See how he defines the problem… If only

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:19.880
we too, adopted this approach to all the shit
that comes our way, rather than try and be

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:30.940
clean and completely untouched by everything,
can we calm ourselves and say, "Hey, Symmetric!

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:37.070
Perfect Enough!" And move on? I thought that
was a great philosophy right there!

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.980
For the Closing Thought, I wanted to just
offer a connection. Suddenly it occurred to

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.750
me that there is this English word called
nincompoop! Stupid person! Nincompoop… is

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:57.399
a silly, foolish, stupid person.. Has the
word "poop" sitting next to it! I have nothing

00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:02.570
more to say!&nbsp;
Let us meet again on the 28th!
