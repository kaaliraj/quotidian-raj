00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.650
Namaste!

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.850
Nine more episodes have gone by, and eleven
to nineteen, I am ready for questions from

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.850
viewers!

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.539
A friend had written to me about the discussion
we had had on “The dress we wear”. You

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:20.679
may want to spend some time and read it in
full, up here. The important point he was

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.779
trying to make was this. You can do all those
things once you get a brand image. I, for

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.630
example, am a software engineer too. Am a
flautist and Kutcheri performer too, on the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.990
side. I can’t wear a suit to a kutcheri,
nor a silk “jibba” to a classical concert.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:43.070
That was the message he had sent me. I completely
agree. But, what was I trying to say? Well,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.510
all I wanted to convey was that we should
focus on the message. I was telling that to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.180
the LISTENERS and VIEWERS. No, I wasn’t
telling the presenters that they shouldn’t

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.940
obsess about their attire, and that they should
focus only on the message! I wanted the ones

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.300
in the audience to start doing that. Only
then, the presenters will get that crucial

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.870
realisation. That was the point I was making.
Thank you.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.860
Wayne Gretzky’s “Where is the puck”.
“Go, skate, where the puck will be”. I

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.740
guess that quote probably ruffled quite a
few people. Some of you said that it was “easy

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.120
to say (but not as easy to do?)”. Some others
pointed out that it was overused and cliched.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:34.250
I agree that this quote is from a genius of
the game. I always maintain that it is a really

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.770
foolish thing to do to go to the genius of
any subject, and ask them “how they do it”.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.630
Because? He is a true natural. Which is why,
truly accomplished sportspeople rarely become

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.320
amazing coaches. Because, they don’t know
what it is that gave them that greatness.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.440
So… We will surely talk a bit more about
this. In the upcoming episodes. About this

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.700
particular quote by Wayne Gretzky, about sports,
about leadership, we are going to have a brief

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700
snippet.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.371
A friend, a lady-friend, had written, 12+1
= 13 had appeared on the 13th day. Nice! Many

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:16.879
didn’t notice that nuance, nobody said anything,
and it was heartening to see that she had

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.079
noticed it. Thank you!

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:26.599
The three legs of the stool. Many of you wrote
back to me, saying, “Yes, you hit the nail

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.010
on the head, it was so appropriate”… Interestingly,
if you google for it, you realise that the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.169
three-legged-stool as an idea is not just
in finding out whether it is a good career

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:43.599
opportunity for you. There is a three-legged
stool in investment. There is a three-legged

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.120
stool in leadership. There is another three-legged
stool in retirement planning! It seems to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.669
be a very powerful metaphor! If you search
for a “three-legged stool”, right from

00:02:51.669 --> 00:03:01.890
“How to win a war”, all the way to “How
to lead a happy married life”, you have

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.019
got a three-legged stool! Enjoy!

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.840
We talked about the coming age of robots.
That story… we were talking about, “Hey,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.340
try to get yourself a career where the robots
will aspire..” Forget about “Will a robot

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.890
take my job”, and start focusing on “Will
a robot want my job” — I had said. Many

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.150
of you visited that website, and even shared
the numbers you had received for your respective

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.639
careers. I think I have a safe future… Or,
I think I am done for.. What do I do now..!

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.519
Many of you had commented thus. Let us understand,
it is a little tongue-in-cheek. A little mockery

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.620
was involved. But… Make no mistake. Faster
than expected, with a greater impact than

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.470
expected, the robot revolution is coming.
Again, in one of the future episodes, we will

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.269
talk a little more about that.

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.450
We were talking about trust. About keeping
the faith. A relative… actually… he messaged

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.760
me thus. You are contradicting yourself. In
the beginning, you had said, once broken,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.920
it is nearly impossible to put back the mirror
like it originally was. Then, you tell the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.750
story of Michael Jordan, and how they trusted
him again and again, so many times. So, what

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.579
are you really trying to say? Clarify! Well,
in sports, there are many different kinds,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.669
after all. Cricket is one kind of sport. Football
is another kind of game. Basketball is a third

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.540
kind of sport. Different from each other.
In each of these, leadership, trust, and teamwork

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.120
will be on display in different ways. In this
particular case, all I wanted to convey was

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.170
this. A manager, a leader, while their natural
tendency might be to not trust or put faith

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:45.990
in a particular person or situation, in some
situations, should trust beyond the call of

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.919
duty. When it is very clear that it is logically
wrong to trust any further, to trust at that

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.120
time, MAY yield benefits! Your mileage may
vary! It worked out for me. You test it out

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.120
for yourself!

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:08.120
We had talked about the “Be the first, Be
the best, or Do something different”. In

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.990
that story, if you look at Zomato, I realize
that it is also a great example, said a friend.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.300
Oh, yes, I realised. What does Zomato say?
Even if you don’t have a website for your

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.060
restaurant, even if you don’t have an online
menu, I can create one for you, and I will

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.630
supply! Nice idea, I thought! I had talked
about Uber. This friend had talked about Zomato.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.180
I went googling a bit. And, I chanced upon
this news item. Uber Eats has sold itself

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:49.360
to Zomato! Yes! Zomato has purchased Uber
Eats. Interesting. Like minds think alike.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.150
They see synergy, and great things happen.
It is in this synergy that two and two come

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.740
together to become five! We will see in one
of our future episodes!

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.420
I had highlighted the A B C principle. Always,
try to be constructive. Don’t just think

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:09.770
different. Think productively too. A mother
had written to me about what she used to do

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.419
for her children. Always be careful. Avoid
bad company. For each of these, ABC is a nice

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:23.740
metaphor. A nice mnemonic to remember. It
was really pleasant to hear that.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.650
About the Circle of Knowledge, we had talked
twice, if you remember. We had seen how the

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.509
ant too, by its own measure, is “eight spans
long”.. Is that, then, the circle of knowledge?

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:44.310
So, does it mean we end where we begin? Wow!
This is a philosophically deep point. In other

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.960
words, Knowledge is not “Filling Your Vessel”,
knowledge is “Enlarging Your Vessel”.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:59.749
You have a vessel, and knowledge is not about
putting everything into it till the brim!

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:04.379
The pursuit of knowledge. The search for knowledge
is all about making the vessel larger and

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:11.639
larger so it can hold more! So, as you keep
feeding it, it gets hungrier! Think about

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.639
that!

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:18.969
Remember that little twist that Sasikumar,
my colleague, had given? Many of you had commented

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:24.319
that it was so interesting to hear that! “That
was a very different way to think about it!

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:29.400
Once you learn about it, it becomes just a
fistful! Very nice!” you had said. Thank

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400
you!

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:38.259
There was this other point we had discussed.
Learn like a T. Breadth is needed too. Not

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:45.889
just depth. Some of my teammates debated this
for quite some time, and shared this with

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:54.729
me. It was interesting to listen to. That
T? It is not just for furthering you in your

00:07:54.729 --> 00:08:00.759
career path. Another colleague, perhaps from
another domain, when they are part of your

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:06.529
team, what are they actually doing, how hard
is it, what skills are needed for it, what

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:10.650
are the challenges, learning all this is important
and vital even for teamwork to prosper! It

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.219
was heartening to hear this opinion from them.

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:17.509
Niranjana Krishnamoorthy told me that she
has started ordering books from Amazon to

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:24.650
dig deep into the topics we had discussed!
Please subscribe to Amazon Prime if you want.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.330
We are going to encounter a lot more books!
Because, my whole thing here is “Quotidian”.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.910
I am not coming up with something unique and
new, a principle or philosophy nobody else

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.730
has spoken anywhere else before. These are
just pages torn off books that I have read.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.990
All I am doing is to exclaim “Hey, look
at this”, “Hey, read that”, and so on!

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.970
So, you are going to buy a lot of books! Enjoy
the reading! And, yes, share what you read!

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.520
One friend told me — “I am trying to predict
what you are going to talk about next. You

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.970
have spoken till now about this… What are
you going to come up with next.. Is there

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.080
a schematic? Is there a connection? I am thinking
about it!” Well, let me know if you arrive

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.730
at a conclusion. Because, as far as I myself
know, I am not doing this with any theme in

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.450
mind. I just think about it in the morning,
analyse and collect the threads by evening,

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.450
record it at night, and publish it the next
morning. That is how it has been running along

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.450
till now.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.760
The same lady said, “Your contents are very
deep, profound, thanks!” I need to tell

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:30.410
you something here. I am learning. I am not
just sharing what I know. For example, that

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:40.380
Russian proverb that I shared with so much
“pride”, that proverb? I didn’t know.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:46.630
I didn’t know it until that afternoon! While
I was searching for something, I chanced upon

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:53.590
this Russian proverb, and liking it, I decided
to share that with you all. That’s all.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:10:00.940
So, if I am doing Quotidians, there is a little
hidden agenda there. To learn something new

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:09.230
everyday, for myself too! So, it is in connection
with that, that I am sharing what I learned,

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.970
what I am learning. That is something I would
like to clarify. Thanks a lot!
