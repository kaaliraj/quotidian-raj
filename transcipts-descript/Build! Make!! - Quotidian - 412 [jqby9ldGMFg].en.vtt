00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.140
His name is Dale Dougherty.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.440
In 2005, he got this feeling.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440
He was a Scientist.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.440
An Engineer.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.800
A Maker.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.849
A Creator.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.220
He had this pretty unnerving feeling..

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.230
The West, particularly America, was becoming
a consumer nation.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.650
All manufacturing was being done by factories
in China.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.290
All fabrication came from there.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.760
We are deteriorating into consumers.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.940
Creation is no longer a popular activity.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.190
That was the feeling he had.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.620
So, he came up with a Manifesto.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.350
Started a magazine, started clubs.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.539
It ran, for almost ten years, it ran.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.350
Ran out of funds unfortunately, but, look
at the Manifesto, and look at the words there.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.250
Make, Share, Give, Learn, Tool Up, Play, Participate,
Support, Change!

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.510
It is not enough if you create and build.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.360
You need to share it!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
Teach others.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.360
Learn from others.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.430
Support everybody.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.280
It was a really beautiful vision statement.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.300
What do you say?

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.460
Dale Dougherty!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.040
Namaste!

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.630
412!

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.180
It is about Building and Making.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:56.179
Particularly, when I saw the cover of this
book, I thought it would be about the Builder

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.240
/ Maker Movement started by Dale Dougherty.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.630
It was called “Build”.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.420
The author claimed it was an unorthodox guide
to making things worth making.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.379
Tony Fadell — we have met him before too.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:17.170
He used to work at Apple during the eras of
the iPod Design and the iPhone Design.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.150
He is the brain behind the Nest thermostat.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.930
Before jumping in and looking at the book,
… he calls it “Unorthodox” — but what’s

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.930
his claim to fame?

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.430
You can’t just like that trust a stranger
nobody just because he has a shaved head,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.430
yes?!

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.430
So, who is he?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.080
When I googled a little about him, I learned
that he has 300 patents to his credit.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:54.560
And, in the last seven/eight years, he has
been marked as one of the Top 100 Most Influential

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.580
People in the world.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:06.510
And, more recently, the list of the Top 50
most creative, most influential, most famous

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:16.310
gadgets of all time featured not one but THREE
gadgets that this guy helped create!

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.349
The iPod, the iPhone, and the Nest.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.920
They feature in the Top 50.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.480
Now tell me, if this guy speaks about Building,
shouldn’t we pay heed?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.519
So, I opened the book, and finished the book
just a week ago.

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.030
And, he… rides roughshod and spites so many
people!

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.030
Everybody!

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.920
The teacher who taught him programming!

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.260
The first company he worked in!

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.680
Steve Jobs himself!

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.769
His boss!

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:52.769
Google!

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.470
The company that acquired Nest paying billions
of dollars!

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.470
Larry Page!

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.819
And, he shows much anger at his own younger
self too!

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:02.819
The past!

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.689
The young unwise version of himself!

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.379
Much vitriol!

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.090
I went through the Table of Contents.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.100
It is beautifully structured.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.340
It has five chapters.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.560
Build your Career.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.780
Build your Business.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.000
Build your Product.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.220
Build your Team.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.220
Build Yourself.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.820
From each of these, I am going to pick out
one or two of the unorthodox pieces of advice

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.790
he had to give, and I am going to present
them to you.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.810
Let’s start with Build Your Career.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:49.199
He says, every single person will face this
quandary some time or the other in their career.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.199
That decision to Quit.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.240
How to do it, how to identify the time has
come, etc..

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.290
well, that is when you will start looking
at the calendar and looking at the clock.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.620
Oh.. is it already Friday?

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.470
Hmm, is it Monday again?

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.419
Ouch, is it still just 3 PM in the day?

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:14.840
When you start doing that, something has gone
wrong in the system, and your inner mind is

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.560
giving you signals, he says.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.290
He also adds, if you are really going to quit,
if you have made up your mind, quit cleanly,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.570
quit quietly, quit after finishing what you
started.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.260
Finish your meaningful contribution.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.730
If the next employer has respected you and
acknowledged your skills, that respect will

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.900
extend beyond tomorrow.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.250
That respect will still be around.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.290
If you are going to quit this job and join
the next one overnight, what will that next

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.290
employer think?!

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.470
He might also think, oh, is this how you will
leave ME in the lurch too, when the time comes?

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.860
Particularly, he says, people will not remember
how you STARTED a job.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.759
They will surely remember how you FINISHED
it.

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.410
So, do a good job, before leaving.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:15.180
Also, slightly controversially for me, he
says, … remember the Starting with Why philosophy?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.009
That personal mission statement?

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:25.800
Analyse it, understand it, deeply, and internalise
it.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.770
And then, as long as the company you are working
in is aligned to YOUR internal mission statement,

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.290
continue in that job.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.009
Else, move on!

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:47.889
And, he gives a personal anecdote — Personal
electronic gadgets was MY mission statement,

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.800
I changed ten companies!

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.740
Failed in many.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.389
Succeeded finally at Nest!

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.710
Probably he’s got a point there.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:07.000
And, finally, do not EVER use quitting as
a negotiating weapon.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.300
I will quit, if you don’t give me that hike.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.240
If you don’t give me onsite opportunities.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.419
If you don’t assign me to that project.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.030
Never do that, he says.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.620
That’s about your career.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.690
Building your Business.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:31.180
He says, how do you spot a good idea?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.020
Not the one that you keep chasing all the
time.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.650
There will probably be hundred such.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.410
But, the one that keeps chasing YOU all the
time.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.240
Remember the lamb that followed her everywhere
in “Mary had a little lamb”?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.840
Similarly, this idea will keep chasing you.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:08:00.140
For this author, the idea of a smart thermostat
chased him for TEN LONG YEARS!

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.520
A temperature controller!

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520
Ten years!

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.590
The other thing about ideaspotting, he says…
it will keep chasing you like a lover..

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.889
But, don’t immediately give in.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:13.510
Keep them at arm’s length.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.340
He refers to the brilliant idea of Daniel
Kahneman’s.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.680
Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.680
Remember?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.310
There is this phrase called “Delayed Intuition”!

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:30.080
If you take a hasty decision, it is bound
to go wrong.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.289
Just when it seems like you have to make an
emergency decision, that’s when you should

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:37.289
delay it.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.289
Tomorrow.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.289
Next month perhaps.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.010
Check if it burns with the same intensity
still.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.230
That is how you spot a good idea.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.740
And, it should not be just for you.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.820
It should be for you, and as you talk about
it with others, they should go, “Yes, I

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:57.580
also have the same problem, Yes, I also suffer”,
and a crowd of early adopters should come

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.580
in tow!

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.110
Then, it is a good idea!

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:08.380
Also, he says, too many people make the mistake
of thinking that their idea is a world-class

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.520
amazing idea.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.790
But, it is a vitamin.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.019
Not a painkiller.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:18.390
Painkiller is NEEDED by everybody.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.980
They NEED to buy it.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.790
The vitamin?

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.839
You think they should buy it!

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.310
There is a big difference between those two!

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.990
Be very careful!

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.350
Then he moves on to building your product.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.870
You have an idea, but how are you going to
build it?

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:46.180
There is just one shining, unorthodox advice
he gives.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.970
He says, project plans won’t work.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.180
Any new idea that comes along, any new invention
that happens, you will always want to add

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.462
that too in the upcoming version.

00:09:54.462 --> 00:10:00.080
The concept of Minimum Viable Product is all
just hogwash.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.300
So, do what Jeff Bezos himself does, at Amazon.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.360
Write the Press Release of the product before
you start the product!

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.880
Is it January now?

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.209
Are you hoping to launch the product before
it is Christmas?

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:19.890
Well, write a Christmas Week Monday Press
Release.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.940
Imagine you are going to make a press announcement
then.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.980
Press Releases aren’t advertisements.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.510
They aren’t brochures.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.050
They will only tell truths.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.580
They won’t market.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:36.350
Now, this press release document has to be
framed and hung on the wall at your workplace!

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:42.630
As you move closer and closer to that document-version,
be happy!

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:48.140
If some new features gets introduced that’s
not even mentioned in that document, prune

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.140
it!

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:56.860
And, when the time comes that you are as close
to that press release version as you can be,

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.910
go ahead, launch it, that’s the only way!

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.280
That external commitment!

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.430
Of having given your word to somebody else,
some stranger!

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.910
No need to release the document.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:12.019
But, the very fact that you have committed
thus to the outside world, that is enough

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:14.130
to keep you on your toes.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.380
And, he has done it, it seems.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.120
That is the way he launched all his products
on time.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.110
Another tidbit about building your product.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.520
He recalls the great Steve Jobs, and how he
launched the iPhone.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.459
And, in fact, how he launched almost every
other Apple product.

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:39.230
People would just pause and stare and gawk
with open-mouthed awe!

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.230
The audience..

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:46.950
For, that was the power of the storytelling
ability of Steve Jobs.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.290
Such rapt attention.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.560
Eyes open, forgetting to blink…

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.150
How was he able to work such magic?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.589
How much practice did he do?

00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:02.430
That was our thought always, about him.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.050
But, you know what?

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:10.970
Tony has worked very closely with Steve Jobs,
for a long time, and we need to pay heed when

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.050
he says this.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.389
He says, Steve Jobs didn’t practice coming
on stage and delivering it.

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:17.420
(Though that is what you read..

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.620
So many books keep repeating about that obsession
he had for presentation perfection).

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.620
No.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.620
You know where he practiced?

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:31.450
Every time he met a friend, he talked with
family, he went and met some team members,

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.380
met some competitors, he kept repeating that
story.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.959
How did he make us believe it, you wonder?

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.860
Well, he believed in it completely, for starters!

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.540
Only because he was completely trustful of
the story, he didn’t have to spin a yarn.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.980
He just had to speak it as it was.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.279
And, you started to believe it.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:56.350
He was telling his version of the truth.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.050
He was not spinning a lie.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:06.639
And, thus, similarly, do you have a true story
about your product that you completely believe

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:07.740
in?

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.880
Get that story.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.500
That’s the one we want as consumers!

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.720
Beautiful, isn’t it?

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.970
Then, he comes to building your team.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.000
How are you going to put together?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.050
He has some bits of advice.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.200
Unorthodox!

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.000
Firstly, he says, look for creating multigenerational
teams.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.620
Everybody shouldn’t be post-millennials.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.420
Nor grumpy old people either!

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.420
No.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:42.740
Have young people, old people, men, women,
people who have seen the World Trade Center

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:48.220
fall down, people who have not even started
using Facebook, that is the diversity you

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.630
should aim for.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.860
That is when ideas will truly flourish, he
says.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.010
I completely agree.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.940
Multigenerational is the way to go.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.920
The other thing he says about creating a team,
is about interviews.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.949
Typically, interviews are conducted by the
HR representative, and by the person this

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:14.560
new candidate is going to report to.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:22.240
Very rarely, the team that’s going to work
with that guy, … for example, if he is coming

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.050
in as a developer, then the others in the
team may do a peer review of sorts.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.600
And, it usually stops there.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.260
We miss out on one important component.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.950
Who are the internal customers for this person
who is coming in?

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.149
There might be a designer.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:44.850
And, that designer lady may be regularly taking
inputs from this developer and might be giving

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.720
stuff back to this developer.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.450
Make that designer lady to interview this
candidate!

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:56.010
There may be a marketing person, who may have
to take inputs from this guy.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.800
So, who are the internal customers?

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.800
Find that out, and make them interview the
incoming candidates.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:09.589
A bit time-consuming, yes, but I think it
will really reap dividends.

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:13.150
Finally, building yourself.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:18.040
In fact, building yourself is the first chapter
in the book, but I kind of upset the order

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.010
because this looked better for me.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.230
Building yourself.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.889
He tells us about a Steve Jobs anecdote.

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:35.529
Steve used to hate management consultants.

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:37.980
From big brand name companies.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.670
He used to go livid, when he chanced upon
them, it seems.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.670
Why?

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:50.320
His analogy was a framed picture of a banana.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:57.570
They don’t have any experience having worked
WITH bananas.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.240
But, they have pictures of bananas.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.120
Here is a banana.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.529
That’s a grape.

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:03.959
This is a pine-apple.

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:06.620
They haven’t tasted any of those.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.120
So, their knowledge about it is theoretical.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.330
Not practical.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:20.660
And hence, unless you stand knee deep in that
sludge, unless you shovel that out, you will

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.399
never know what the nuances are.

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:30.170
Until then, you are just having a gallery
of banana pictures.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:36.389
And, finally, he refers to this book.

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:38.150
Called the Defining Decade.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:44.170
This is about the teenage decade.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.300
Fifteen to twenty-five.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:54.250
Many make the mistake of thinking this is
one happy carefree lull of an extended vacation.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.550
But, it is supposed to be the defining decade
for you.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:05.230
And, he gives us three words to take home.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.230
Do.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.230
Fail.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.230
Learn.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.230
That is the cycle.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.230
Don’t wait to Learn.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.230
Do.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.799
Having Done without Learning, you will likely
Fail.

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:18.589
Having Failed, observe and Learn.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.900
Having Learned now, Do better!

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.970
That is the cycle!

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.530
The number of times you successfully complete
this cycle in this defining decade, that will

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.510
define how well you succeed in your career!

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:38.120
As a closing thought, I would like to go to
the book’s closing thought!

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.020
He brings it to a beautiful conclusion, actually.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.400
He says, “At the end of the day, there are
two things that matter.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.220
Only two things.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.390
Products and People.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:59.420
Basically, the stuff that you build, and the
people you build that stuff with.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:10.000
So, the ideas you chase, and the ideas that
chase you (Mary’s little lamb!) will define

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.600
your career.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:20.350
And, the people you chase them with, may define
your life!”

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.400
How beautiful!

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:33.370
We will meet again next week, thank you!
