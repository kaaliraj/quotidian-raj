00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.509
Namaste!

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.099
The biggest mistake that many people commit?

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.370
Is in the matter of the salary.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:15.920
You do a job. They give you something in return.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.760
They even use a dirty word called “Compensation”.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.429
That “give and take” that happens?

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.849
The biggest mistake that happens during this
is: we end up comparing.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.865
How much is he getting? How much is she getting?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.451
How much am I getting? This comparison.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.120
And, even this comparison, you compare it
on only one parameter.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.700
We use just one measure to find out if we
are faring better than the others.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.670
And that is wrong. This one parameter is Money.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.672
How much are you earning? How much am I earning.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.260
That is the only thing that is readily apparent,
and perhaps that is why we end up doing it.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.350
But, big… big… mistake.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.790
If we were to evaluate a job offer, you have
an opportunity to work somewhere, and you

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.120
need to decide whether this is right or not,
whether you should accept the offer or not,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.680
if you need to think that through carefully,
or if you want to critically examine the current

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.080
job you are already in, whether it is balanced
and well-rounded, if you were to attempt to

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.500
find that out, there is a trick!

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.570
This particular furniture is called “ottoman”.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.880
This European “stool” made of wood can
be used as an example.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.070
A metaphor.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.740
If you were to explain it simply, you see
these three legs for this stool?

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.530
Let us place an R on each.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:50.420
R, R, R. If the ottoman is not to get “aattam”
(shake), the three legs have to be of the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.110
same length, I hope you agree.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:01.280
If one were to get a bit explicit, we can
say “If you want to balance your arse…,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.040
you need to balance your R’s!”.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.450
Shall we take it like that?!

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.460
So, what are these R’s?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.670
Shall we look at them one by one?

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.820
The first R is Remuneration.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.870
We have already touched upon this matter.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.870
Money.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.990
How many thousands of rupees are you raking
in?

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.170
How many lakhs of rupees?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.390
Very clear simple number.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.680
But, how do I look inside?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.310
How do I evaluate whether the remuneration
I am getting is good or not…?

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.740
Well, do not just see how much revenue the
company is making.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.440
How rich your boss or the owner of the company
is.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.650
How much money he has, she has, in the bank.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.650
That won’t do!

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.200
You need to ask these two additional questions.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.620
Is it his money?!

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.260
Or is it an investment from outside?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.330
Does he have control over it?

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.000
Does he have complete ownership on it?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.920
That is the important question you need to
ask.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.290
And, similarly, there is another question
you need to ask too.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.470
Is it enough if they have it?

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.950
We need to know what they are intending to
do with that money!

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.870
Does he want to help society?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.180
Does he want to buy a jet for himself?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.900
Does he want to improve the economic status
of the lowest of the low?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.400
Or, is he happy just taking care of himself?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.000
Is she happy taking care of herself?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.490
That is the question you need to ask!

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.770
So, two questions.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.620
The first is “Is it their money?”

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.280
The second is “Do they have their heart
in the right place, to spend it right?”

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.970
The first R — Remuneration.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.490
The second R is Responsibility.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:53.520
The best way to find out if you are given
a responsible job is, are you missed if you

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.760
take a couple of days off.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.990
Oh, you came?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.220
Did your work?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.220
Fine.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.270
Oh, you didn’t come?

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.320
Somebody else did your work?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320
Fine.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.310
Basically, are you the only person best suited
to do the job that you have been given?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.520
That is an amazing test for getting yourself
a responsible job.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.620
What is the proof that you have been given
a responsible role?

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.760
Well, there is nobody else who can do an equally
good job of it!

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.130
That is why you have been appointed for this!

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.130
That is good responsibility.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.590
There is this huge machine there...?

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.740
I am responsible for it.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.310
This huge team here…?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.500
I am the one who will answer whether they
are doing good work or not.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.730
That is Responsibility.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.970
So, the second leg in that ottoman?

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.970
Responsibility.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.220
Are you given a responsible role…

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.410
Remember to look out for that too.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.690
Not just Remuneration.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.690
The third R?

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.690
Is Renewal.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.690
Your brain..

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.690
it is a muscle too.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.550
Just like the biceps and triceps and quadriceps
of our body, our head, and the grey matter

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.570
within it, that too, is a muscle.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.140
You need to exercise it.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.639
What do you need in your job to exercise it
regularly?

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.660
You need a learning opportunity.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.290
Ways to renew your mental muscle.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.190
How do we test that?

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.440
How do we check and ensure that we are in
a position to renew it?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.440
Well.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.440
Here is the trick.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.710
Have you been given a job where you just have
to USE what you have already learned and mastered?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.430
OR, Do they say, I trust you, I know you are
a fast learner, I also know that the job I

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:44.740
am going to give you is not something you
already know how to do, I am trusting you,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.540
I know you will learn on the job, take it
forward!

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.740
That is Renewal.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.690
It is an opportunity for renewal.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.550
So, we saw the three R’s.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.820
Remuneration — Are they giving you money?

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.010
Responsibility — Are they giving you important
work?

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.090
Renewal — Are there opportunities for you
to learn?

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.020
For you to improve and become better?

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.190
Only if these three R’s are balanced, you
can sit on it!

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.180
Thank you!
