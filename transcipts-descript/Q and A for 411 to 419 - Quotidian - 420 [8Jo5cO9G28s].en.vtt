00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.640
Raj:- Namaste!

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.150
Four Hundred and Twenty!

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:24.830
Yet another “tenth” episode where we get
into a conversation, we read some of your

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.570
comments, we answer some of your questions,
and basically, connect with you!

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.079
Today, we have Mahesh, he teaches at Zoho
Schools of Learning, and he is a senior developer

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.450
who works with me at Zoho Corp.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.230
Welcome, thank you for agreeing to host this
event, Mahesh.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.989
In fact… guess what happened?!

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:57.430
I had messaged all my regular viewers who
were friends in Whatsapp, “Are you in Chennai?

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.379
Do you want to help me by cohosting Quotidian
420?”

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.830
Some of them thought that I was addressing
them specifically and felt elated…

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.810
some felt concerned too..

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.540
Sorry, this was a group message.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.960
But one person…

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.960
This guy..!

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.530
He asked me, “All that is okay, thanks,
but, .. Why me?

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.670
Why specifically for 420?!”

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.549
Well, let me give you the answer now!

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.710
“I thought we would be friends for life,
you would work with us hand in hand, that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.759
we would work long and hard, and become truly
exceptional, reach great heights, .. but..

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.200
then.. you pulled a 420 on us..!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.830
You left us, moved to a different city, and
perhaps that is why we chose you..?!?

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.830
(Jus’kiddin!)”

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.219
You know this guy, don’t you!

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.219
(Bleeeep!)

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.219
Ha ha!

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:47.219
Alright, let’s get started!

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.219
Over to you, Mahesh!

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.479
Mahesh:- Thank you, Raj!

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.280
Thank you for the nice words!

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.729
It is my pleasure to be a part of this amazing
series.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.810
Without further ado, let’s read out the
comments!

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.220
Comment from The Illusion of Life, Q 411,
Suthar Son says “The last closing thought

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.710
was very nice, I liked it!”

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.769
This was the comment about the connection
between art and life…

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.019
Raj:- Oh..

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.489
The Bertolt Brecht quote..

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.489
Ok..

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.970
Art should not just be a mirror, reflecting
life..

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.910
It should be the hammer that sculpts..

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.810
Kamal Hassan has talked about this too.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:41.410
During a recent interview after the roaring
success of the Vikram movie, Kamal says, “Observe

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.150
Malayalam cinema..

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.980
Observe their culture.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.519
They seem to have identified a particular
style of movie making and story telling..

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.569
There is a lot for us to learn from them.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.930
It doesn’t mean Kerala culture is different
from Tamil Nadu culture, and that is why it

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.290
works like that.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.290
NO!

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.590
It is the movie that is probably sculpting
Kerala culture.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.720
That is a beautiful angle he gives us!

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.790
Mahesh:- Okay, that’s interesting!

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.700
Next, Hari Ram says, “Nice definition on
one’s life, quoting with Disney’s 12 principles,..

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.970
but if the cartoon behind the screen is in
color, it wud be more highlighted…”

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.390
Raj:- Ha… ha..

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.650
I understand what you are telling us, thanks,
while we were postprocessing, we had the video

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.940
dim out a bit because of technical reasons..

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.349
But.., we saw 12 amazing animation principles..
and, we had picked up a few life lessons from

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.409
it.. while we are talking about such high
philosophy.., if you are going to wish that

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.470
the cartoon had been in full color..?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.230
Well, you know how it sounds like?

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.280
It sounds like you are saying, “I would
have read the Bible if the cover of it had

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.989
been showing Jesus…

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.760
It is a black-colored book, and that’s why
I didn’t read the Bible!”

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.370
Take what’s inside.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.250
Don’t judge a book by its cover!

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.500
Probably that’s where we get that idiom
from!

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.050
Mahesh:- One more request from one of your
viewers..

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.070
“One request: Any Tamil books connecting
the Quotidian topics?”

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.410
Raj:- Yes, I saw that comment too.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.270
You are asking me to recommend Tamil books
for you to read and probably connect with

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.270
Quotidian topics..

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.690
I haven’t read much in Tamil.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:52.440
Only in recent years, I have been scratching
the surface.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.180
I am NOT the right person to actually find
out what book to read in Tamil literature

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.180
next..

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.310
Let me do this for you.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.350
I will ask my friends.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.640
I will try to get the answer for your question
and supply it in the next “Tenth” episode.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.440
But.., actually, I would also like to tell
you something more important.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.680
I want you to look beyond language..

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.680
If you want to learn something properly, you
need to stretch beyond a specific culture

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.820
or a specific language.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.250
You need to read about what they say about
this concept in other cultures and other languages.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.770
Only then will you get a broadminded understanding.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.770
About religion?

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.770
About God?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:44.000
If you are going to stick to books in a single
language, rooted in a single culture, I don’t

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.640
think you can get a full understanding of
… anything at all!

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:54.300
So, if you really want to understand a subject,
learn about it from multiple dimensions, multiple

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.470
angles, two/three different languages, three/four
different cultures.. that would be my recommendation.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.820
Mahesh:- Thank you, Raj!

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.610
I am sure many of your viewers will be looking
forward to your Tamil book suggestions…

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.790
Raj:- Tamil book suggestions…!

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.590
You tell me, if you know of any!

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.450
Mahesh:- Moving on to the next Quotidian,
Build..

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.450
Make..!

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.650
Q 412, Sumitra Palanisamy says, “Awesome
oneliner, do not ever use quitting as a negotiating

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.650
weapon!”

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.960
Raj:- Yeah, yes, yes..

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.240
Do not use quitting as a negotiating weapon..

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.050
“If you won’t give me this salary, if
you don’t give me this hike, if you don’t

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.970
give me this position, if you don’t send
me onsite to the United States, .. I am gonna

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:39.970
quit!”

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.970
Never do this..

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.500
Similarly, another little tidbit of advice,
Sumitra, I hope you are listening in too..

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:53.190
If a manager or a senior person or somebody
from HR approaches you immediately after learning

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.800
that you have decided to quit, and starts
saying stuff like, “If you stay back, we

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.990
will give you this role, we will give you
this raise, we will give you that project

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.150
you had been asking for for quite long”,
even then, please do not accept that from

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.150
them!

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.150
That also is valid..

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.150
What do you say?!

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.460
Mahesh:- Yes, Raj, sure!

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.830
Okay, the next Quotidian, Doting over dots..

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.330
Q 413.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.430
Smartjeev says, “Loved this sir..

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.400
Glad that you’re delivering your thoughts
in mixed mode switching between Tamil and

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.470
English.. fortunate that Tamil is a big bold
connecting dot between us..!”

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.370
Raj:- Oh, okay.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.370
Thank you.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.750
It really makes me happy to see you thinking
like that.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.610
When I started this I wasn’t sure if I should
do it in one language..

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.690
Many people sent me feedback too.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.040
That if I had done this in English, it would
reach a wider audience, etc..

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.640
But, these half-baked Tamil folk…

00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.120
like me, like you, who know Tamil, who know
that language better than they do any other,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.340
but that doesn’t mean they understand pure
classic unadulterated Tamil either!

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.500
But, we want something that is conversational,
we occasionally include some simple English

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.420
sentences, but predominantly conveying the
hard concepts in Tamil..

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.580
That is the sweet spot we are aiming for!

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.430
And I hope I am reaching that.. over time!

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.430
Thank you for your support!

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.250
Mahesh:- Neil Neero also says, as a comment
to the same video, “In Veritasium’s last

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.830
video, he spoke about the same thing you spoke
about chess players..!”

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.900
Raj:- Oh..

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.900
Okay..

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.940
The thing that differentiates a genius chess
player from a beginner?

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.940
Well.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.130
I didn’t copy the idea after watching the
Veritasium video..

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:49.460
Yes, I have seen so many videos from so many
places, I have read books, I have come up

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:56.300
with my own connections, and it is highly
likely that… if a person as famous as Veritasium,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.870
a global celebrity, if he talks about this
same topic, well, I am only happy and honoured!

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:08.490
I am thrilled beyond belief that somebody
like Veritasium is also talking about this

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.120
concept, because it is an important concept,
it breaks a myth!

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.120
It clarifies that Viswanathan Anand is not
a memory-maestro!

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.500
His memory is all about context!

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.480
He remembers chess!

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.570
That doesn’t mean he will remember his wife’s
birthday!

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.990
That concept..!

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.990
Thank you!

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.480
Mahesh:- This is from the next Quotidian — 414!

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.710
Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn!

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.620
Arunkumar Jothilal adds, “Kattrukkol, Agatru,
Meendum Katrukkol”!

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.290
Raj:- Very beautiful..!

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.290
Kattru!

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.290
Agattru!

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:43.770
That is beautiful wordplay!

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.770
Thanks a lot!

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.460
We had used Padi, Marupadi, with a Maru in
between!

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.240
Kattru, Agattru!

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.030
Very nice!

00:09:52.030 --> 00:10:00.390
Mahesh:- Sankaran wants to know, “What font
type you are using.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.310
And, how to bring that wavy border to images
and arrows.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:11.530
Don’t ask me to Google”, he says, “I
would love first hand information from you!”

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.530
Raj:- Thank you.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.170
This is a presentation software called Keynote.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.810
This is from Apple themselves.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:22.300
I use a specific “wavy border format”
from the options there.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.120
The font names, I have mentioned them here
for you..

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.460
But, again, focus on the content.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.960
Not on the specific font.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.640
In fact, if you notice, the first hundred
/ hundred and fifty Quotidians, I used some

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:42.390
other font, and then the hundred or so, I
have decided to use some other font..

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.340
The presentation should be secondary.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.900
Focus on the message.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.150
Not on the messenger.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.340
Or the packaging!

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:56.000
Mahesh:- A comment from the Should Or Must
Quotidian — Q 415.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.840
Sumitra Palanisamy, in fact, not only her,
I noticed a few other comments too, they are

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.060
very fond of the “Ada Chee Poviyaa!”

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.570
pronunciation you had introduced.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.340
Raj:- Oh, okay!

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.490
Fear of the unknown..

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.700
Fear of failure..

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.700
Wasn’t that the thing?

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.010
I had given you a wrong pronunciation on purpose…

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.740
As if I were chasing it away.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.960
I think you need to know the original, though.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.870
I don’t want to be blamed for teaching the
wrong pronunciation, after all!

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.150
Aty-ki-fobia, is the original.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:37.150
But I thought if you remembered it differently,
your motivation and willpower will go up!

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.210
Aty-ki-fobia is the right one!

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.540
Mahesh:- Comments from the next Quotidian.
416 — Elegantly Simple!

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:53.100
Arul Kumar says, “Every school MUST need
a math teacher like you!”

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.100
Raj:- Oh, …

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.720
Mahesh:- The one where you talked about the
Pythagoras theorem and all that..

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720
Raj:- Hmm.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720
Ok, Thank you.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720
Thanks for that thought.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720
It is indeed an honour..

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.440
And at the same time, I feel humbled to hear
this.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.810
I have a request to all Maths teachers.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:16.040
And also to people who will be evaluating
people so they would become Maths teachers.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.580
The BEAUTY of Mathematics.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.240
Teach them how to enjoy that BEAUTY!

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.340
To be in awe about it.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.390
That is enough.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.720
If you can just teach that, the child will
learn mathematics.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.610
It is not the harder concepts in mathematics
that are hard to teach.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:41.500
It is the simpler concepts in mathematics,
whose beauty, whose hidden beauty, is hard

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.500
to teach.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:50.100
If you focus on that, how everything in mathematics,
even seemingly unrelated concepts and principles,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:56.380
they are related in a .. in a universal manner,
if you can somehow teach that to them, if

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:03.070
you can join with them in appreciating this
beauty, they will take the next step, of digging

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.910
further and getting at the treasure.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.930
That is what we need to focus on!

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:07.970
Mahesh:- Yes.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.520
True words, Raj!

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.730
Sumitra Palanisamy also adds, “Simple is
elegant, Simple is beautiful, Earlier your

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.690
Quotidians were max 10 mins, nowadays 21 mins.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.820
And this Quotidian is 15 mins, which is simple,
elegant, perfect!”

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.820
Raj:- Ha…

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.980
Okay, I get what you are trying to convey
indirectly..

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.730
Attention span is dropping, but the video
length is growing..

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.050
That is what you are threatening to convey!

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.050
I understand…

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.050
A famous person once quipped…

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:42.750
“If you want me to give you a two-hour presentation,
I am ready today.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.960
If you want only a five-minute speech, it
will take me two weeks to prepare!”

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.830
(Mark Twain) True words..

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:56.020
For, the hardest job is to convey something
briefly, with import, focus, and concentration.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.390
Without being circumlocutory about it!

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.230
Come to the point!

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.960
Cut to the chase!

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.400
That is a whole art by itself!

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.900
Perhaps we can learn that from Thiruvalluvar!

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.480
So, I don’t know when I am going to reach
there..

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.610
I hope we will reach there soon.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.260
Till then, please watch my videos till the
end!

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Thank you!

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.110
Mahesh:- Comments from Active Listening — Quotidian
417.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.370
Karthee Vidya says, “Thank you so much Raj.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.620
Such a lovely video.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.020
So much of learning.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:43.290
The final Ted video views comparison is so
beautiful.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.560
Looks like all 11 types have an advantage
and a disadvantage.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.480
So, what kind of listener should we be?

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:57.930
Or, should we be a different listener in different
scenarios or to different people?

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.380
Some thoughts on it will be useful.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.380
Thank you!”

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.850
Raj:- The book pretty much says the same thing..

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.220
We are not here to tell you that there is
one right type of listening.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:12.700
It is not as if there is one type with no
flaws at all..

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:18.850
If you use any of those without understanding
the scenario and context, it won’t work

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.850
out..

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.850
Just like in cricket.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.460
Defensive strokes ALWAYS is wrong, just as
Chris-Gayle-Sixers ALWAYS is a recipe for

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.460
disaster!

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.670
You need to play depending on the ball that
comes at you.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.420
Play it to its merit.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.220
Similarly, these eleven types, they are your
toolkit.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.720
And there are two reasons why you should know
what those types are.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.920
One:- If somebody is talking to you, and while
you are listening, observe yourself.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:47.149
Oh my God, I am becoming an empathetic listener,
I am becoming an interrupting listener, I

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:54.190
have to change… you start telling yourself,
pull yourself back, shake yourself awake,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.890
so you can be a neutral listener again.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:07.530
Two:- When YOU are talking, and when somebody
who is listening seems to behave oddly, … you

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:13.340
can tell yourself, “Oh, this guy is probably
that kind of a listener, let us cut him some

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.300
slack..” and you can forgive him.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.440
So, did you LISTEN to me now?!

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.630
Mahesh:- Thank you, Raj.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:25.200
I am sure many of us would have found this
useful.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.380
Also, it should take a little bit of effort
from our side.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.400
We are aware of those eleven types.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.370
Now, we have to do a bit of homework ourselves,
and then be a better listener.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:46.080
I am sure your future videos will have a better
listening span!

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.360
Vanitha takes a spin on the same kind of question.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360
Insightful..

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.150
What kind of listener am I if I keep thinking
on what to reply to them so that they don’t

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.740
feel like, “She didn’t react to what I
said, guess she is not listening to me!”…

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.309
Raj:- Well, we did see that quote from Stephen
Covey.

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:09.990
This guy isn’t listening to me..

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.411
He is just bothered about what to speak next,
how to fill the silent-gap perfectly, that

00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:15.411
has been his focus..

00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:18.959
How are they going to answer to me next..

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:24.439
People, they have to understand, they have
to receive and understand.

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:28.120
And that is the focus people must have, says
Stephen Covey.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.770
“She didn’t react to what I said, guess
she is not listening to me” — Why does

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.300
that thought even arise?

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.640
We are assuming that person is one of eleven..

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.520
Unfortunately, that person happens to be something
else among the eleven..

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.720
What are you going to do!

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.540
Mahesh:- The Biggest Risk.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.540
Quotidian 418.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.929
A couple of comments from that.

00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:53.620
Lakshman K says, “Thank you sir, thought-provoking.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.841
Indecision is the biggest risk.

00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:59.000
Risk takers or doers are often judged after
the risk.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.070
When a riot succeeded, they call it a revolution
but when a revolution fails, they will judge

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.150
it as a riot!”

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.150
Raj:- Correct.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:13.160
And, not just that, if you remember the Sepoy
Mutiny — the English version used that phrase.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.240
But, if you look at our Indian History, the
same event is referred to as the First War

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.240
for Independence!

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.170
So, it is not just a riot that is successful
that gets called a revolution…

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:29.080
It is also in the eyes of the beholder, don’t
you think?

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:36.010
Mahesh:- Davos says, “You cannot be two-minded,
once you have decided to do something..

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.039
This is the question that everyone should
ask to themselves while taking a risk.

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:44.710
One more question that you can ask yourself
is, “You can risk being wrong.. or you can

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:45.710
be boring!”

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.260
Raj:- That’s a beautiful quote..

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.130
We always have two choices.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:59.800
You can take a risk, it might go wrong too,
but it gives you the opportunity to place

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.220
yourself in a platform.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.330
The other, … We encountered a poem titled
“The Man in the Arena” — in Quotidian

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.330
029.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.890
So, you could be the man not in the arena.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.670
The man in the stands.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.670
Watching.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.470
Eating popcorn.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.640
Commenting about MS Dhoni’s runout.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:26.280
So, you can take that plunge, and risk, and
suffer if you go wrong and win if you go right,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.040
or, you can say this game is not for me, I
will just watch.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.050
That’s a challenge.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.640
And, if you watch, you are boring!

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:41.179
Nobody remembers the 40,000 people who were
sitting around MS Dhoni when he got run out.

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.260
But we remember MS Dhoni!

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.630
You gotta decide for yourselves!

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.500
What do you say, Mahesh?

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.920
Mahesh:- Sure, Raj!

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.240
Thank you Raj, we are done with the comments!

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.910
Raj:- Oh, thank you then!

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.340
That brings us to the end of four hundred
and twenty!

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.650
This 420, 420, chaar sou bees, .. has been
getting a bad rap..

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:04.570
That it is associated with cheating, cunningness,
dishonesty.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.040
420 can be a good number too!

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:16.700
I hope you have got that feeling from this
video.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.750
Meet you again, at 421!

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.400
Thank you, bye bye!

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.630
Mahesh:- Thank you!
