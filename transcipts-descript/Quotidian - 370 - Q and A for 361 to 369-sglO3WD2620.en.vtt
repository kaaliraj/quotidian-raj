00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.770
Namaste!
370! And, it is time for looking back at some

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:28.481
of the comments and opinions we have received.
Ram Kumar talked about some limitation that

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:36.220
seems to be existing in YouTube when adding
playlists. He wanted us to categorise them

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.399
further. Nothing of that sort caught my eye,
when I went searching. But, yes, your feedback

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:54.140
is taken, and we will be having sub-playlists
like Playlists That Talk About Education,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.330
That Talk About Organisational Productivity,
etc, we will be bringing soon. Thank you!

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:09.510
Pram. Ramesh. A classmate from college days!
He talked about the good balance between the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.850
chemicals. D. O. S. E. Dopamine, Oxytocin,
Serotonin, and Endorphin. He talked about

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.369
how it was such a good analogy. Yes, we gotta
thank Simon Sinek for that. It is something

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.780
that we forget sometimes. The human body is
actually a chemical factory. It creates a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.500
lot of chemicals. It ejects a lot of toxic
chemicals. Amidst all that, the psyche, or

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.840
the mind, that intangible, amazing extraordinary
concept called the Spirit, it is indeed an

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:56.499
amazing miracle, a mystery.
Shine and Glow talked about the twelve traditions.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.140
The ones from Alcoholics Anonymous. That is
what is special about it. You can find such

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.069
lists, even the Bible has the Ten Commandments,
and so on. But, an organisation like Alcoholics

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:18.440
Anonymous has adopted these as principles,
and from that, an organisation, any company,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.660
any group of people working towards even a
profit motive, that was the connection I thought

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.290
was useful.
Sankaran referred to the Ten Thousand Or Twenty,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.830
and exclaimed "This One! This Is The One"
was so good.. Just at the right time.. But,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.340
in the past 370 presentations that I have
worked on, this is something that I have encountered

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.520
more than a couple of times, I would have
felt it at least a dozen times. A friend would

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.620
write in, all of a sudden. Your video arrived
at EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME, like a Samaya-Sanjeevi

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.740
(reference to Hanuman bringing the Sanjeevi
herb to revive Lakshman in the Ramayana)..

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.050
And.. I take no credit for that. You would
surely remember this quote by Paulo Coelho.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.160
If you take a firm decision, if you really
want something to happen, if you have started

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.390
channeling your full attention and energy
towards it, the universe will conspire, it

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.230
will align itself, and it will conspire to
make it work for you, he said. In exactly

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.250
the same way, probably, the time was right
for you, everything was already aligning for

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.050
you, and I was just one more person doing
the bidding of the universe, aligning my thought,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.280
so you could go ahead with your initiative.
All the best!

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:57.780
Aarthi fondly remember the Definition For
Success from the 1963 Harvard Class. In fact,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.870
Hams talked about the same thing too. How
the definition for success was so close to

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.700
the concept of Ikigai. If you remember, there
would be this line in the definition of success…

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.660
"Be Happy Privately". When I dug a little
deeper on the subject, I encountered an interesting

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.340
passage in The Holy Quran. There is this chapter
in the book, titled Al Hujurat. The prophet

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:34.270
talks about, Peace Be Upon Him, The Holy Prophet
talks about how to treat neighbours. Seems

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.290
there are eleven qualities. The Rights of
a Neighbour. The Rights the neighbour has

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.100
on you. It sounded even a bit extreme. One
went "Before you build an additional floor

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.450
to your building, please get the permission
of your neighbour"! This is because it might

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.700
restrict ventilation or reduce sunlight streaming
in! Ask their permission! Such a beautiful

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:08.430
line! Similarly, and this was the one that
kinda got me all tense, "If your neighbour

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:20.321
commits a sin, help him hide it"! That is
the extent to which "neighbour-concern" and

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.470
"community spirit" is being talked about.
I don't know if I have interpreted it correctly,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:31.840
probably some of our viewers can help me with
that… The extent you should go to.. If your

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.180
neighbour does a mistake, even if he does
it, forgive him, help him bury it. Think about

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.750
that!
Varadarasan came over after a long hiatus.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.280
He gave a beautiful summary of all that we
have been doing. This is exactly what we have

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.180
been doing! Without breaks, with no intent
to hurt anybody, yes, I tried to finish it

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.410
off in just one shoot/shot, and we succeeded,
and the many wonderful stuff around the world,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.360
the books I had read, the sights I had seen,
the stories I had heard, the people I had

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.940
met, and, Tamil, I have been on this journey
of trying to get interested in Tamil, the

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.230
language and its literature, such a beautiful
language, there is so much to learn, and I

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.550
wanted to carry something over to you, something
useful, that was my wish, and movies. This

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.830
has been Quotidians. So beautifully described,
thank you Varadarasan.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.840
Sumithra congratulated me and said, "I am
not going to use the word 'consistent', let

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.930
me say the videos were of high quality, instead".
And, Manikandan wondered, wow, you are continuing?!

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.700
Did he probably think that I wouldn't be continuing?
But…we have brought in a few changes, I

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.000
have already told you in the previous episode
that I have changed the periodicity / regularity

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.460
a bit. Pi.. பை-ய - We saw how we
were intentionally slowing down, for a reason.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:57.850
Not just that. We have implemented a few more
changes too. Let us take a look at them before

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.690
we finish today's episode.&nbsp;
Lean Factory appreciated the many interesting

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.590
connections we brought in the InBreeding episode.
From the Ngorongoro Crater to the Habsburg

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:16.970
Jawline, and the importance of interaction
between teams in an organisation, he said

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:25.510
it was a good job. And it is important that
we all realise the critical role played by

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:34.460
echo chambers. The extent to which its harm
has spread, it is being talked about that

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.470
people should perhaps have two accounts on
Facebook, each contradicting the other. That

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.900
is when we will know the real news about the
world. Otherwise, Facebook will feed us what

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:57.560
IT WANTS TO, and not WHAT WE NEED TO. There
is a difference!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.860
I was basking in the warm glow of having completed
365 videos in 365 days, oh, the joy of it,&nbsp;…

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:08.620
a friend pointed something out. That I had
made a mistake. That I shouldn't have done

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:15.160
what I did in 366. It was a good wakeup call.
Every day, doing every video, it is a new

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.290
initiative, from scratch, and I should be
careful that there should be no mistake in

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.389
it… is something I should always keep in
mind. You haven't DONE anything that ALLOWS

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:28.400
you to take things easy. So, they had referred
to my self-mockery of the Habsburg Jawline

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.000
in the Thumbnail for the video, and they wondered
how many people I had hurt by doing that,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.430
I apologise in public for it, and I will be
a little more sensible and cognisant of the

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:53.580
sentiments of our viewers, thanks.
Shine and Glow came back and talked about

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.170
the Elevate App that I had hinted at. They
thanked me for it. There is a lot more that

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:03.730
I want to share with you all, about the App.
I will probably make an EPISODE about it.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:11.149
I am so much in LOVE with that App. And they
also drew another parallel, we were referring

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:19.710
to an advertisement from IIT Delhi, something
very similar that they had come across about

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:25.550
B Tech candidates wanted for levelling the
gravel below the train tracks. Yes, our education

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:33.180
system, our examination system, has to undergo
some change, and soon!

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:41.660
Hams came back and she gave a long note on
Teaching versus Parenting. And, she drew some

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:49.680
very interesting analogies and parallels.
But, according to me, a parent is different

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:58.670
from a guru, a teacher. Not all parents can
be great gurus, and in fact, the opposite

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:03.760
also is true. Not all teachers have really
been great parents. There is even this Tamil

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.860
saying that goes "வாத்தியார்
பிள்ளை மக்கு". Some

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:21.250
of you may have heard of that one. So, this
requires tough love. For a parent to become

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:25.279
a teacher, the love, the unconditional love,
the parent has to be able to set it aside,

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:29.220
and behave as a teacher. Too hard, if the
parent is not able to do it. Similarly, for

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.160
a teacher, they have to learn to reprioritise
love towards the child as more important than

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.690
love towards the subject! Else, it won't be
feasible! Thank you!

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:47.529
Ravi told us that he has been watching this
only in recent times, and it was so interesting,

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:50.142
and the concept of Pi was cute too, but…
he wondered if doing it on a fixed day of

00:10:50.142 --> 00:10:53.570
the week would have been a bit more practical.
Well, I am challenging myself. I could have

00:10:53.570 --> 00:11:00.540
easily said, "Saturday and Sunday, every week,
I will do two episodes". But, I want to know

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:08.360
if I can, in spite of my other demands of
time, still generate good quality content

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:16.490
and keep a smart and intelligent audience
engaged. So, irrespective of the day or time,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:23.279
I want to be able to generate content - is
a challenge I have set myself. Also, let us

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:28.580
not forget.. During these Covid times, a Thursday
is no different from a Sunday is no different

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:36.220
from a Monday. So, just wait for the YouTube
notification, or subscribe to my Whatsapp

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:44.420
Group, and enjoy the show! Thank you!
Arunkumar really did some good research, and

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:49.070
said, 1 to 100 - you had a static caricature
as your thumbnail, 100 to 200 - you brought

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:55.890
in some real-life special effect thumbnails,
200 also brought an intro theme music, and

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:02.220
300 onwards, we see a standing-and-delivering
pose.. Let us see what we can do for 400!

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:09.560
Do you have any suggestions?!
By the way, after completing 365 videos at

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.660
Quotidians, I thought I should slow down and
look back at what I have done and probably

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:22.240
take notes, I didn't want to repeat myself,
and wanting it to be useful for everybody,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:29.430
I have transcribed the whole video.. Whatever
I talked in English, I have typed it out,

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:37.350
and whatever in Tamil, I have translated and
typed it out. You can visit this blog in Medium - called

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:44.769
bit dot ell why slash raj quote. Quotidians
from Rajendran Dandapani - would be the

00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:53.630
title of this publication. You can read all
the articles. They would basically mirror

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.140
minute to minute, second to second, what we
have done in Quotidians.&nbsp;

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:04.589
And, the same content, I have also migrated
to YouTube. So, all videos posted from now

00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:15.060
on, you will also have a beautiful subtitle.&nbsp;
In fact, a friend, sent me a kind word about

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:22.590
Quotidians. I immediately jumped on the opportunity
and started sending her daily videos. She

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:33.750
responded a while later, saying, No, I don't
understand Tamil. When she said that, I retorted

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:39.330
with "I actually talk only 20 to 30 percent
in Tamil, the rest of it is in English, you

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:47.529
can…" - and that was when she told me
that she was hearing impaired… and she depends

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:55.709
on the subtitles on YouTube and YouTube doesn't
do Tamil subtitles, and that's where she was

00:13:55.709 --> 00:14:03.100
stuck. So, here is a message to her: "For
you, I have started translating and transcribing

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.810
the subtitles. Please enjoy and share your
feedback! Thank you!"

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:18.510
A small secret! This secret is about something
that I have discovered as a productivity trick

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:28.860
after 365 days of daily video.. a beautiful
productivity trick.. But, just a minute. I

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.209
think we are short of time. In the next episode
I will tell you about this productivity trick.

00:14:34.209 --> 00:14:35.430
Thank you!
