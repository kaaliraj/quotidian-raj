00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.860
Recently, I read somewhere, something very
interesting, about these smartphones.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.320
That “People are prisoners of their phones…”

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.970
And, probably, that is why, “They are calling
it CELL Phones”.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:29.779
Too many people have criticised it, too many
have called it a curse, a curse of new technology,

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.960
but is there something?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.300
Some thing good that we can learn, as lessons
from these?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.710
Is there anything at all?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.980
Shall we see?!

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.070
Namaste!

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.250
Smart phones!

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:06.580
Once upon a time, they were called “hand
phones” but now they have become “smart”.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:17.040
Are there any life-lessons at all, that we
can glean from observing this ubiquitous device?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.880
That’s what we are going to see today.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.670
We will start with the launch of the smartphone-generation.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.540
Steve Jobs came on to the stage, and mocked
at the other phones that had plasticky keyboards.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.540
Always-on keyboards.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.360
Keyboards that stayed on display even when
they were not really needed.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.100
Because, they were not “on screen”.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.090
They were made of plastic and metal, and were
actually placed OUTSIDE the screen.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.380
He mocked at them.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.810
And, he said, “Here is a phone, for the
first time, that is all screen!

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.810
Metal, glass, … you are taken IN”.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.190
If you want to focus on one-thing and one-thing-alone
at any point of time, for the first time,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.510
there was a product!

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.000
While thinking about this, about the epochal
moment that it represented, I am reminded

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.390
of the advice we all get, about not doing
multiple projects..

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.050
About the wisdom in choosing one project.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.380
For that is when our intent in reaching the
Benchmark of Success is actually much easier.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.940
One thing.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.190
Only one thing.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.570
Deeply focus on that.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.450
So, it makes clear sense.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.970
There is limited energy.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.670
If you are going to apportion it among multiple
baskets, I don’t know if you’ll ever be

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.630
able to fill one of those baskets.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.890
But.., if you take the time to choose, and
become “all-screen” on that, just like

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.750
that phone…!

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.980
The next thing is about battery discharge..

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.890
Hopefully we don’t allow the phone to drain
this badly..!

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.060
For, this screen comes up only when the phone
battery has been drained all the way down

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.060
to zero!

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.730
But, almost every other day, some of us, every
day, we charge our phone!

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.220
We so regularly and consistently, in a disciplined
and almost religious manner, recharge our

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.220
phones!

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.620
Many have started asking, do we recharge our
body, mind, and soul along similar lines?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.060
How do you recharge?

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.000
You do something that is completely removed..

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.270
Some of us may just sit at our desk, doing
nothing!

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.080
And, that is doing something!

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.140
That is recharging!

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.340
Some of us may just go out, embrace nature.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.340
Explore.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.770
Have an adventure!

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.260
Some of us may stay indoors!

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.290
Do yoga.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.319
Do meditation.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.360
Do relaxation.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.970
Do stretching.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.860
But, something that takes you away..

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.230
You keep fiddling all the time with your phone..

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.069
And then, it says, “Hey, give me a break..”

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:23.169
And then, it communes with the energy-giving
environment that it needs.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:32.939
Similarly, our body, our mind, our soul, needs
that commune that replenishes our energy,

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.410
so that we can go back into work.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.389
And, as I talk about this, a phrase that I
hear ominously too often, “Moonlighting”

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.360
comes up for discussion.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.350
Moonlighting is supposed to be the “second
gig” or the “side job” that you do.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.350
One is my work.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.129
The other is my passion.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.699
We hear them say.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.230
But, hey, why can’t we do our job passionately?

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:04.589
See, if your battery needs recharging, so
does your body, your mind, your soul.

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:10.189
And, you cannot recharge it by starting another
application on your phone…

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:11.340
Can you?

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:20.990
And, so, similarly, to recharge your body
and mind, can you start another gig for it??

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.960
One of the important bits of advice they give,
to conserve battery, is “Close other open

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960
applications.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960
Preserve energy.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.520
Save it from being drained away”.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.370
So, why moonlight?

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.059
Why can’t you show that passion in your
main job?!

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:48.979
Originally, when the smartphone was announced
to the world, Steve Jobs was not interested

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.360
in an App Store.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.169
Unbeknownst to him, some of his aides, realising
the importance of having one to come up with

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.589
interesting and innovative ideas, to expand
and enhance the power of the Smartphone, worked

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.759
on it without his knowledge, and surprised
him with it!

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.949
Thanks to that, we are able to see millions
and millions of Apps.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.439
It is not the phone really, that is amazing.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:22.389
It is the extra abilities and capabilities
that the phone now has, because of the Apps

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.750
that it has now installed on itself over time.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:32.039
When I see this, I am reminded of that famous
debate.

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.539
They say “Nature versus Nurture”..

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:43.229
If you have reached some place in life, would
you credit your parents, your genetics, for

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:44.229
it?

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:50.259
Or, would you say, it is the people I encountered,
it is the adventures I had, it is the risk

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.849
I took..?”

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:58.060
If you haven’t reached somewhere, are you
going to blame your heritage, your parents,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.270
your genetics?

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.039
Or, are you going to say, “I didn’t learn
things right..

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.449
I didn’t pick the right risks..”

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.349
Is it nature or is it nurture?

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:14.529
Is the PHONE the reason for it being special?

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:18.830
Or, are the Apps that run on it, that make
it special?

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.990
What are the skills you have learned along
the way?

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.750
What have you accrued?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.479
Is the phone taken out of the fresh packaging
going to remain AS IT IS?

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:33.729
Or, are you going to install some App to enhance
its ability?

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.099
Nature.. versus Nurture..!

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:38.479
Did you know!?

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.830
There is a phone that looks like this!

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.430
I was completely taken aback!

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.229
“Light” is the name of this phone..

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:48.879
And, thankfully, it has gone out of business.

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.789
It is focusing on something else now.

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:54.460
It is “focusing” on something else now..!

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.860
This phone has sixteen cameras!

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.360
Sixteen cameras!

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.039
It can purportedly give DSLR-quality images
when photos are shot using it.

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:09.770
But, sixteen cameras!

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:15.699
No smartphone will really want to cram sixteen
cameras into its body!

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:16.699
Sleek body..

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:17.699
Right?

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:26.979
That is why, now, with the launch of every
new operating system and phone, both in the

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:34.569
Android world and in the iOS Apple world,
we are hearing about a new term.. a very interesting

00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:37.760
new term, called Computational Photography.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.550
And, what is it all about, actually?

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:45.209
The camera is still the same..

00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:48.750
The lenses, still more or less the same.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.170
But, the stuff we do with the light that is
coming in?

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.560
The stuff we DO!?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.470
That is the magic!

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.769
We do edge detection!

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:00.070
We do facial landmarking!

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.370
We perform image fusion!

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.370
Highlighting.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.370
Local tone mapping.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.070
True tone skin.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.740
Fusion of layers.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:19.720
Auto-white balance, exposure correction, everything
happens on the raw input, using software magic!

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.709
The light is the same, the lenses are probably
are the same, but what we can do now with

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:32.880
extra image processors, AFTER receiving the
light.. that is what is making our photographs

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.279
amazing.. claim both Google and Apple!

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:45.779
This concept… the failure of the sixteen-camera
monster called Light, and the latest successes

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:53.220
of the smartphones of today featuring computational
photography, when we compare these two, I

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.310
am reminded of that age-old quote.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.089
Life — ten percent of that is made up of
what happens to you.

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:05.589
But, a full ninety percent is made up of what
you DO with it.

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:06.589
The reaction.

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:09.000
Everybody gets light.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.370
But, the cooking I do, the creating I do,
the enhancement I do, with the light I receive?!

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.580
Everybody gets a grain of sand.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.920
But, only an oyster can turn it into a beautiful
pearl.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.070
So, what are YOU going to do with what life
has DEALT to you?

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.680
Are you going to ask for more and wait for
more?

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:43.519
Or, are you going to perform whatever magic
you can with whatever you have in your hands?

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:44.940
Think about it!

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.170
Sensors!

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:54.660
If you tear a smartphone apart, there are
probably only TWO things you will see more

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.180
and more of.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.180
Battery.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.180
Sensors.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.940
Larger and larger battery — not too large
though, for the sleekness of the phone will

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:02.940
be lost.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.930
And, a lot of sensors.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.079
You have a GPS.

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:08.150
A barometer.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.769
A temperature sensor.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:12.149
A light sensor.

00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:21.310
Position sensors, accelerometers, movement
sensors, magnetometers, all kinds of sensors.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.589
Guess why??

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:29.050
We can’t make the battery larger beyond
a point!

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.079
What is this person doing?

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:34.480
What am I actually using the phone now for?

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:41.470
Am I holding it, am I reading something, is
it face down, is it moving in a vehicle, where

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:46.990
can I save time, where can I optimise it,
where can I protect the battery from being

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:54.899
drained, .. To ask questions such as these,
you need to know about YOURSELF..

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:57.920
The cellphone wants to know about itself..

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.800
Are notifications ON or OFF?

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.360
Is our man sleeping or awake?

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:09.440
Is he having it on his hand, or does the phone
lie somewhere on a table, unattended?

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.370
Is he tapping something furiously, or is he
consuming by just looking at the screen?

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.889
Can I open my camera a little to see if the
guy is actually looking at me, or looking

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:21.689
elsewhere?!

00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:26.709
So many beautiful questions, it is asking,
for what?

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:29.740
To know about the SELF.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.490
Why?

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.990
To save the battery.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.920
To optimise it..

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.490
Whatever limited potential it has, it wants
to use it at the right time, in the right

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.329
direction, to help us to the max.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:44.430
Lesson for us also!

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:49.060
I heard there is a Greek saying.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.912
Up atop the Parthenon, the Temple of Delhi,
there are three important messages that greet

00:12:55.912 --> 00:12:56.912
visitors.

00:12:56.912 --> 00:13:00.759
The first one is “Gnothi Seauton!”

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:01.759
Know Thyself.

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:08.939
You have to learn about yourself, your limitations,
your strengths, your weaknesses, what are

00:13:08.939 --> 00:13:13.050
the things that are threatening you, what
opportunities are available for you, that

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.130
SWOT analysis..

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:22.910
If you do that, you don’t need to enlarge
the battery, you just have to use it optimally.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.710
You can do amazing stuff!

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.900
Your brain doesn’t need to be bigger.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.560
It just needs to be focused.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.269
And, for that, Gnothi Seauton!

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:35.800
Do you even know?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.050
What makes you angry, what makes you happy?

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:44.010
Do you know what your worst distractions,
what your weaknesses are?

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.970
Do you know what stokes your passion?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.110
What allows you to go that extra mile?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:57.120
If you know that, .. success will follow automatically!

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.660
Finally, every cellphone is retired.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.240
And, when you retire your phone, what do you
do?

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.190
You don’t just throw that phone away, get
another phone.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.350
Do you?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.350
Of course not!

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.939
What do you do?

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:15.300
You put it up into a cloud.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.790
Could be iCloud, could be Google Cloud..

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.769
You make a backup of it.

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:28.180
Once that is done, you reinstall the important
bits on to the new phone, when the next generation

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.550
phone comes along.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:36.209
The moment the new phone is in hand, an image
of the old one comes on to the next one.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:41.649
When I think about this, I am reminded of
a famous quote by Stephen Covey.

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:44.850
A beautiful life principle.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.720
He said, “Yes,…

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.689
To live.

00:14:51.689 --> 00:14:52.689
You have to live.

00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:53.689
Don’t just exist.

00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:55.290
And, yes, you have to love!

00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:01.810
Do everything with love, you have to shower
unconditional love on the people around you.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.810
To Live.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:03.810
To Love.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.810
Of course you have to laugh!

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.699
Don’t take life too seriously!

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:09.730
Why so serious?!

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.910
You have to laugh.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:17.360
And, along the way, while living, while loving,
while laughing, you have to make some mistakes

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.580
so you can learn.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.190
But, is all this enough?

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.790
What are all these for?

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.880
Living, Loving, Laughing, Learning…

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.920
What for?

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.480
Don’t forget that.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.509
That end goal is important.

00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:36.240
What is that end goal?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240
To leave a legacy!

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.600
A positive impact as proof of your existence.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.259
Probably a book.

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:43.540
Probably a happy child.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:49.330
Probably a new process, a new system, probably
a new concept, probably a new product, probably

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:56.350
an approach, a methodology, probably even
a lesson on HOW NOT TO LIVE A LIFE, whatever!

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:03.279
But, something should leave your body and
go up to that hive mind, … a space where

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:09.410
everybody can perceive and understand, and
it should be reinstalled in the operating

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.199
systems of the people who come after you.

00:16:12.199 --> 00:16:15.070
That is Leaving A Legacy.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.250
Just like that smartphone.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:23.620
I really pity that phone which is just thrown
away and a new phone is bought and is started

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620
to be used.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.319
Something has to hop over!

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:29.940
Wasn’t there a single important message?

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.149
A single important photograph?

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:37.860
Similarly, if a life has been lived and passed
away, is that it?

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.410
Or, is there a lesson to be learned?

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.550
Something to be imbibed?

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.670
Think about it!

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:52.689
Today’s closing thought, … I was thinking,
until today, that you have to close unnecessary

00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:54.480
Apps to conserve battery power.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.190
Somebody had asked Tim Cook himself about
it.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:03.910
“Do you quit your iOS multitasking Apps
frequently and is this necessary for battery

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.560
life?”

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.670
Craig Federighi, Tim’s second-in-command,
responded thus.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:17.240
“No and No!

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.580
You don’t need to do that!

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:24.660
We have done a LOT OF research, about how
to conserve battery life!

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.840
It doesn’t mean you should only have one
application open.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.200
You can have other Apps open too, in the background.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.560
We optimise it.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.560
Don’t worry!”

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.520
On this very same day, meanwhile, my team’s
daily-read instalment from a Robin Sharma

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.520
book featured this!

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:52.080
“Never forget that 
time spent enriching your non-work hours is

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080
never a waste.”

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.350
We saw about the battery discharge, we discussed
Moonlighting, and called it “criminal”.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:03.860
But, Robin here says you have to enrich your
non-working hours.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.841
“It makes you tremendously efficient during
your working hours.

00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:08.841
Our biggest ideas often come during our most
relaxed times.”

00:18:08.841 --> 00:18:09.841
A colleague, after reading this, shared his
own experience about it too.

00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:11.650
“Whenever I am on to resolving a difficult
issue in any project I couldn’t even concentrate

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.280
on it after a while and the bug will all appear
to be mysterious…

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.010
I take a random chit-chat with my teammates
regarding any incident recently happened to

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.090
them or us and refresh my mind or our minds,
if we were trying to fix together and then

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.180
the moment we have a refreshed look at the
same bug, our mind’s neuron connection will

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.330
fire a little differently than before and
thus possibly increase the chance of fixing

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.040
the issue more easily..

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.040
Have fixed them too…!”

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.040
So, enrichment is important.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.040
Have a side-hobby!

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.590
Not a money-making gig, but a side-hobby.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.550
At least tangentially relevant to what you
are doing today!

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.540
That is very important!

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.650
That is the finer point that I wanted to share
with you in the closing thought.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:55.390
So, YES, moderation 
is important.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:19:00.630
Everything in moderation,… including moderation
itself!

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.430
Words to live by… sometimes!

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:17.470
Thank you, I will meet you again next week!
