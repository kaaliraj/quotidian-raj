00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.810
Extra-terrestrial!

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.010
Not part of earth…

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.719
From somewhere outside!

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.420
Steven Spielberg, in the 1980s, directed a
movie titled “E.T”.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.599
He introduced that likeable alien character
to us too!

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:37.829
Probably, in his honour, two famous scientists,
Paul Horowitz, and Carl Sagan, launched an

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.780
experiment to search for extra-terrestrial
intelligence.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.680
They searched through the signals they received
from outer space, and looked for something

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.719
good, something special, something unique,
in them.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.030
Is it all dull mechanical natural sounds,
radio waves and emissions and occurrences,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.910
or.. is there something intelligent living
out there!?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.020
They spent more than a decade, sifting through
all those signals.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.790
It seems, they were able to identify every
one of those countless signals they received,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.890
as quasar signatures and blackhole radiations
and so on….

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.890
All except…

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.890
37 signals!

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.030
They remained unassigned!

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.360
Unaccounted for!

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:49.880
We are going to talk about some of those 37
signals, today!

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.079
Namaste!

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.280
Four hundred and one!

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.540
I told you we would be talking about 37 signals,
but, sorry, I didn’t give you the whole

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.740
story!

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.329
Actually, there is a company called 37Signals!

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:15.299
It is founded by this person — we have met
him earlier too, in Quotidians.

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.630
Jason Fried is his name.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.379
He, along with his cofounder, David Hansson,
built this beautiful company.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.170
And, what’s the claim to fame of this admittedly
small company?

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.549
Take these three, if you want!

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.900
The CEO has written, or co-authored FIVE BOOKS!

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.510
I am not going to tell you about the fifth
book yet…

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.150
He has just released it, so, I want to read
it before telling you about it!

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:00.900
This CEO and his company has brought into
this world a beautiful and powerful web development

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.900
framework.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.769
A web application framework — some of you
might have even heard about it.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.280
Ruby on Rails!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.030
They CREATED this platform!

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.639
Not just a product, but a product using which
products can be built easily!

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.260
Take that, as claim for fame!

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.189
Not only that, they have been launching products!

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:24.290
As many as five products…

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.230
Then they cut the number down, and then raised
it…

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.230
BaseCamp.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.230
HighRise.. and so on.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:39.239
Some of these products are pretty famous,
in some places around the world!

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.310
Claim to fame of this company called 37 Signals…

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.529
Alright, but what are we talking about here??

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.940
Recently, 37Signals did a Thuglak.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:00.920
This is a company that was born in the year
1999.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.170
Around 2014, this man, Jason, said, “We
are going to focus deeply, narrowly, from

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.170
now on.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.279
We have been focusing on too many products
(just a handful, mind you!) we are going to

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:18.950
narrowly focus, and to reflect that, we are
going to change the name of the company, and

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.470
it will be the name of one of our top-notch
products.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.840
So, they renamed their company, 37Signals
(with that E.T reference!)

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.900
they renamed it to BaseCamp.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:42.570
In 2022, the same guy said, “We have a lot
more ideas for a lot many more products!

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.060
Email, for example, is begging to be reinvented.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.960
We are going to introduce a new product called
Hey!, and that’s going to change the world!

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.640
To reflect that, to convey that we are no
longer a one-product company, we are changing

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.890
our name again…”

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.430
To what?!

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.740
“To 37 Signals again!”

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.510
Fine…

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.250
“But, there is something really beautiful
here.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:19.040
The reason they gave it that name, yes, the
extra-terrestrial reference, meaningful intelligence,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.760
signal amidst noise, … yes.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.450
But, he created a manifesto and published
it.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.030
May 2022.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.400
37 beautiful principles.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:40.350
He called them “Principles we hold dear,
principles we swear by!”

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.920
It starts with 00.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.500
37 items like this.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.840
Not only that, he made a reference, a back-link
so to speak.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.270
To the same 37 signals document that he had
published way back in 1999.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:09.780
Even in 1999, he had published a document
cataloging things that he held with utmost

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.780
respect.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.150
Firmly believed in.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.100
Swore never to slip from.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.090
Yes, that set is different, some of them are
antiquated, but.. what gumption..!

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:27.680
To say, “Here is who we are, and 23 years
ago, that’s who we were!”

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.210
How many companies have the guts to remind
customers of a dim past 23 years ago!

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.210
Think about it!

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:39.860
What we are going to do in the rest of the
time today is to take a quick look, a short

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:46.570
tour, through some of the principles that
I felt resonated with the way things worked

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.880
with me, the way things worked in my company!

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.030
Let’s get started.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:58.470
Number One:- He says, “We have an obligation
to independence.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.770
We have to be independent.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.840
That is an inalienable right, an unwavering
belief.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.720
We are not here for an exit.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.650
We don’t want venture capital.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.910
We don’t want to become specialists in spending
money.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.780
We want to become specialists in EARNING money.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.810
And, that cannot happen if we have too much
money in our hands, if VC money is raining

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.930
into our bank accounts!

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.680
We are not looking for an exit!”

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.150
He even has a podcast.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.070
The Distance.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:35.560
If your company has been around for more than
twenty-five years, if it has been prosperous,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.330
profitable, you can talk to him on that podcast!

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.330
Special!

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:47.310
He says, “We want to do things that no one
would give us permission to do.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.440
If you have other people’s money in your
hands, you would have to follow their guidance

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.040
on how to spend it!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.100
We want to be owners of our destiny!

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.770
To try things other companies would be afraid
to try.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.390
We want to SKIP SAFE.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:15.010
We want to do original stuff” If you take
Zoho Corp itself, as an example company, at

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.860
Zoho we do Zoho Schools.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.760
We do rural upliftment.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.560
We can do these only if we are sponsoring
it with our own hard-earned money.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.580
There won’t be outsiders questioning our
every move.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.660
We can check for ourselves, if we are doing
it right for the long term.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.320
Do you get the point?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.870
So, it is an obligation to independence.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.709
For 23 years, we have been doing it with our
own money, he proclaims proudly.

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:39.639
We haven’t been ever in the red.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:45.610
We have always made more money than we needed!

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.579
Number Two:- Work isn’t war!

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:55.579
What are you really here for?

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:56.579
To fight??

00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:01.420
If you read articles, reports, and news items,
they would have words like these.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:08.350
“Companies CONQUER the market, they CAPTURE
mindshare, they TARGET customers, they employ

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:18.850
a sales FORCE, they hire HEAD HUNTERS, to
FIGHT with competition, they DESTROY the competition,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.439
they pick their BATTLES, and finally, they
make a KILLING.

00:09:23.439 --> 00:09:24.439
How MANY words!

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.439
How much blood!

00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:30.230
It needn’t always be like this.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.770
There can be a Win Win.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:40.500
There is enough for more than one company
to work well with other companies and prosper.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:49.649
If you look at the Animal Kingdom, this is
the fearsome crocodile, but there is a bird,

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:52.230
called the Egyptian Plover Bird..

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:58.649
When the Plover Bird visits, the crocodile
is very careful and mindful not to snap its

00:09:58.649 --> 00:09:59.649
jaws shut!

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:00.649
Because….

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:02.509
rotten meat is stuck in its teeth.

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:10.559
It is food for the plover bird, and it is
dangerous if it remains in the crocodile’s

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:11.620
teeth.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.389
What a beautiful symbiotic relationship!

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:17.100
So, look for Win Win!

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.100
We come in peace, Jason says!

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.660
I want to believe him.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.610
I think there are companies who are like that.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:34.790
Number Three:- Small teams are especially
beautiful!

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.370
You can’t recapture it if the team grows
large.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:44.040
In particular, if a team grows large, they
can’t do small things…

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.110
That’s the power of small.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:52.029
You do what NEEDS TO BE DONE rather than overdoing
it.

00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:54.620
Doing what all can be done!

00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:00.519
If you look at this Dilbert comic strip, it
conveys it clearly!

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:05.540
“Do you realise that no human would be able
to use a product with that level of complexity?”

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.110
Version 1 of the product would be useful.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.490
Version 2 would be usable.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.910
Version 3 will introduce a new feature.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.500
Version 4 will be unrecognisably more complicated
and complex.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.500
Why!?

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.220
Team has grown in size.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.760
Bureaucracy has set in.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.480
Jason says, “We believe in small teams”.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.459
In fact, he goes on to say, “We work with
small customers and small clients.

00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:29.709
We are small.

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:32.769
We like small!”

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:35.079
Interesting!

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:37.829
Number Eight:- A really beautiful concept,
laid out in Eights!

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:44.850
He talks about this 8 / 8 / 8.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.639
How many CEOs do you know who talk about SLEEP!?

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:54.180
He says, Eight for work, Eight for life, Eight
of sleep!

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.389
That is how you should split your life.

00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:02.110
It is NOT work/life balance, it is work/life/sleep
balance!

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.100
Not stopping with that, he gives us a book-recommendation
too.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.709
“Why we sleep” — by Matthew Walker.

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:16.430
Read this book, understand the mysteries and
the special importance of Sleeping!

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:21.759
How many CEOs do YOU know who recommend that
you sleep more?!

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:24.269
Hats off!

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:27.369
Number Eleven:- What does this say?

00:12:27.369 --> 00:12:30.510
It talks about NOT emulating the office!

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.699
He says, “Thanks to the pandemic, the office
has been brought home!

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:37.120
Not necessary!

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:44.529
You can work remotely, yes, but don’t try
to do all the meetings you used to do at office,

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:46.209
at home too!

00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:52.369
No need to bring everything over to Zoom,
have fewer meetings!

00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:57.100
There is no need to know where everyone is,
what they are doing, trust them more!”

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.809
I find it difficult, it is a challenge.

00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:04.700
I am eager to know what each person in my
doing at any particular moment.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.360
It is not a question of just trust…

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.069
It is also a question of letting go.

00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:13.959
That things will pan out well enough, soon
enough.

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.800
You don’t need to know everything.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.970
That wisdom.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.769
He also adds a beautiful line, “ASAP is
Poison.

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:30.329
There is no real pressing need to make everything
happen LIVE and at the moment.

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:32.910
Try asynchronous communication too.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.420
I have asked you the question when I found
it feasible.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:43.529
You prepare and send me the answer at a time
YOU find feasible”.

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:51.269
Number Nineteen:- Nineteen is about paying
people, and not paying mailing addresses.

00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:59.139
People should be paid what they deserve, what
they are worth, and not based on the cost

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:02.040
of living of the neighbourhood they are living
in.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.220
Sounds a bit controversial.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.410
How can a San Francisco salary equal that
of a Chennai salary?

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.939
But, that’s what he is proposing.

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:14.860
Companies hire people.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.980
Not mailing addresses.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.399
So nice to hear (at least!)

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:28.269
Everyone in the same position should get paid
the same, no matter where they live or who

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:31.559
they are — anywhere in the world.

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:32.559
Bold claim.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:37.619
Implementation, legal aspects, I have no idea
what hairballs they would be.

00:14:37.619 --> 00:14:40.649
But, it is evident what he respects.

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:44.110
And, regarding that, I have a good feeling!

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.630
Anywhere in the world.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.190
Think about that!

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.019
Is that even possible?

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:52.740
In this company, it seems to be!

00:14:52.740 --> 00:15:01.429
Number TwentyOne:- It talks about Knowing
No!

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:03.170
Simple word!

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.850
Always, you have this choice.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.679
Should I say Yes?

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:09.250
Should I say No?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.629
When you say No, it is very clear, you are
saying No to one thing.

00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:18.600
But, when you say Yes, do you realise?

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.040
At the end, you have said No to a lot of things.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.399
Steve Jobs approached this same precept from
a different angle.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:32.769
When we bring a feature into a product, before
we say Yes to it, before a single Yes, we

00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:39.170
actually have a thousand Nos, he said.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.170
Saying No.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.170
Diplomatically.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.170
Practically.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.160
Learn to say it!

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.899
Number TwentyTwo:- What does it tell us?

00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:50.690
It is about StayUps.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.089
StayUp?

00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:57.269
Is there a word like that?

00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:58.862
Oh, it is supposed to be “next version”
of Startups!

00:15:58.862 --> 00:16:00.689
Anybody can build a Startup, it seems.

00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:02.949
Has it been around 23 years?

00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:04.829
Has it ever seen profit?

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:07.459
Has it stood on its own legs?

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:08.970
That is a StayUp!

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.809
“We prefer to champion StayUps!

00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:17.309
Companies who have proven their worth, figured
out what their business is all about, and

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:23.470
strive to stick around for the long term”,
Jason says.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.179
Just last year, at Zoho, we celebrated our
twenty-fifth year.

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:28.980
25th year of profitability.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.019
25th year of standing on our own feet.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:37.980
25th year of championing other StayUps like
ours!

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.209
There’s a good resonance here.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:45.730
Number ThirtyFour:- He says, “Sleep on it!”

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:51.750
He had advised us that ASAP is poison.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.550
He gives additional advice.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:17:00.190
He says, “If you have finished some work,
and you think about it at the end of the day,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.170
you would have a WOW feeling.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.449
The end of the day has a way of convincing
you what you’ve done is amazing!

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:11.569
You will be on top of the world!

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.850
But…

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:18.439
The next day morning, the next morning has
a way of telling you the truth.

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:22.289
What did you do really, the previous day?

00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:24.610
How much more remains to be done?

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.220
What are the hastily done things from the
previous twenty four hours that have gone

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.220
horribly wrong?

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:37.710
So, the advice is, even if you are sure, end
of the day, don’t rush your decisions, sleep

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:38.710
on it!”

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:46.140
A few days ago, we had encountered a book
titled, “Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind”.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.429
So, take it slow.

00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:49.470
Kahneman thinking.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.530
System Two.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.880
Take it easy.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880
Take it slow.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.470
We have come to the Closing Thought.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.539
I had told you, Jason Fried, in 2022, refers
to the original document written in 1999!

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:01.559
I went ferreting out there.

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:06.760
Is there some signal that is really beautiful,
worth including.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:18.370
There is one Signal, in that 1999 version,
where he talks about Copy Righting.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.390
The right way to write!

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.420
Firstly, do not cut the budget ever, when
it comes to copywriting.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.350
Don’t let the designer or the developer
wear a second hat and do a so-so job!

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.200
Get a writer!

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.309
Look at the words.

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:39.250
He says, “Seduce me.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.720
Entice me.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720
Entertain me.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.980
Educate me.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.490
Don’t be cryptic.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.820
Don’t be stupid either.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.510
And, finally, please don’t be dull.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.220
Only if your writing passes all these tests…

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.220
there is a chance…

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:05.429
That famous eight-second rule for memory and
attention… if you want to grab the customer

00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:13.320
and pocket them for life, please do not skimp
on this budget.”

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.600
Think about it then.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:23.750
We will meet again soon.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.370
Namaste!
