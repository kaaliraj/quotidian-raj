00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.389
I recently watched a performance.

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.040
An artist came on stage and started juggling
plates.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.040
One.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.040
Two.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.040
Three.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040
Four.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.570
Five plates at a time.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.400
And then, he stood on one foot.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.520
Blindfolded himself.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.720
Continued juggling.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.630
In fact, towards the end, he even managed
to offer his autograph to a member of the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.080
audience, all this while still juggling!

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380
A thundering applause followed.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.670
Exceptionally good, I thought.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.899
But, only later, much later, when I got the
opportunity to come backstage, I noticed something.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.970
There is much more than meets the eye..

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.850
Because, behind the actor, there were shattered
plates.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.519
Hundreds of them.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:09.189
When we compare ourselves with somebody else,
… we compare their successes with our successes

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.570
AND failures.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.420
That is the problem!

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
Namaste!

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.430
Apples…

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
Oranges…

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:36.830
Is it right to compare the two?!

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.299
Comparison is wrong.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.430
Roosevelt himself has said that.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.750
American president — it is the thief of
joy, he claimed.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:57.329
When you are joyful, if the devil of comparison
shows its ugly head, you are done for.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.659
Because, you will no longer be joyful.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.659
You are unique!

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.619
Everybody has declared that and motivated
you with those words.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.340
You are SO special.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.840
You be you.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.739
You do you!

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.670
All the others are taken!

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.670
You are..

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.400
You are the only special person!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.760
Where does that come from?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.980
It comes from the genetic makeup.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.360
The society, the environment, you grow in.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.980
If you look at it mathematically, if you try
and calculate how many different YOUs there

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.520
can be.., you arrive at 1 in 400 trillion
as the answer!

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:53.650
In such a large number, when you the single
one, when you start comparing with others,..

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.910
we have seen these two symbols in mathematics.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.549
Either they will all be better than you..
whoever you look at, “They are better than

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.750
me in cricket!

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.640
They are better than me in singing!

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.659
They have more followers than me in TikTok!”

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:18.090
And, when you realise that they are all better,
you get depressed.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.840
You lose joy.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.900
You no longer have that motivation to do good.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.220
On the other hand, all the other people you
compare with, they will be poorer than you,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.310
not as good as you, not perhaps having as
many followers, not perhaps singing as well

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.560
as you can, not playing basketball as well
as you do, .. what happens?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.910
Complacency sets in!

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.980
You start thinking yourself as the King!

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.840
You start resting on your laurels.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.910
Like the proverbial hare and tortoise story.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.750
And, again, pathway to disaster.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.310
One in four hundred trillion…

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:18.560
Except for one person, any other person you
compare with, you are going to be better which

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:29.220
leads to complacency, or you are going to
be worse which leads to depression.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.400
So… why BOTHER?!

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.320
This lady, Laura Miles — has given a beautiful
TED talk.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.100
She uses props.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.120
See there?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.729
An orange.

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.340
A banana.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.900
And, she says, “My teacher called me and
told me that I hadn’t done well in the test.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.759
She told me that I was bad..

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.330
I went to my Mom, told her what happened.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.870
And, Mom said, “You are bad..!

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.870
Improve!”

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:08.289
“Mom,” I said, “The teacher didn’t
say I was bad.

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.360
The teacher said I was a bad orange..

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.970
I was thinking I was a good banana.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.220
She said, I wasn’t shaped like an orange.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.980
I wasn’t juicy like oranges should be.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.560
My skin wasn’t thick enough.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.550
I was a banana.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.880
Mein banana banaana chahthi hoon.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.670
Orange naheen banaana hai mujhe.”

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:48.950
When that is the situation, if you are going
to be evaluated on a completely different

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.610
benchmark, you are going to be labeled..

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.490
no point, is there?

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:06.740
You want to be somebody, you set your own
benchmarks, and be the best that you can be.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.580
This book, we have seen earlier too, by Peter
Thiel.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.789
Titled Zero to One.

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.790
He gives advice to startups.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.330
One of the most beautiful pieces of advice
he gives… slightly controversial too, perhaps.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.860
He says, “Monopolies are better”.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:33.130
He warns us, “Hey idiots, don’t head in
the direction where all the competition lies,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:41.670
and strive to do better than everybody else,
instead, focus on identifying a narrow enough

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.710
market, where you can be the monopoly.”

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.570
He gives reasons for that too.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.370
He says, in a monopoly, profits are assured.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:07:00.099
Apple, for example, is the only company that
probably does hardware as well as its own

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:05.350
software, brings them together so beautifully,
and sells them at a premium.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.040
He can demand any price he wants!

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.380
Nobody else around in that market!

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.699
Also, when you are a good company, you start
considering the welfare of the employees.

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:24.639
For, only when they are happy and doing well,
the company can innovate continuously and

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:27.300
hope to maintain the monopoly.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.280
And, you start also looking at what you can
do for the society.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.729
You can’t do all this if you are in a competitive
world.

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:47.430
Also, anyway, these monopolies are temporary.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:54.039
Google, for example, was thinking it was the
monopoly on Search Engines.

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:57.470
But, what is yesterday’s hot news?

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.919
It is Red Alert in Google.

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:01.919
Code Red.

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:02.919
Why?

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:03.919
Some new beast called ChatGPT..!

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:08.580
Everybody is using that to find out everything
that they want to know, they are not using

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.110
Google any more, what happens to our Ads business..

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:19.820
If you are in a monopoly and you think it
is permanent, you are in trouble..!

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.469
Why does Peter Thiel say that this monopoly
is important?

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:27.620
The opposite of it is .. in Economics they
call it..

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620
Perfect Competition.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:34.140
In the world of perfect competition, .. it
is like salt..

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.729
The marketers try many things.

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.570
Iodised salt, pink salt, etc.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.839
But, salt is salt.

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:42.969
Sodium Chloride.

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:45.240
Its price won’t climb.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.330
It is commoditised.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.900
Everybody knows the effort required to manufacture
salt.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.630
And to ship it to your door.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.870
And, a little costlier and a little cheaper.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.610
That’s all it is going to be.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:03.390
If that is the kind of world you are going
to be in, you will always be looking over

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.390
your shoulders..

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.390
Who is coming?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.360
To meddle with my business?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.000
To undercut me and grab my business?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.480
It is an average world.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.769
Do you want to continue selling average things
to average people in an average manner?

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.100
Or, do you want to stand out?

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:32.320
While on the subject of “Standing Out”,
he talks about two kinds of companies.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.269
There are Successful companies — they are
Happy companies.

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:41.310
All Happy companies are different.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.529
Because, each of them have found that niche.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:49.329
A special identification exclusively for themselves.

00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:54.720
They monopolise that special problem and try
to solve it.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.339
But, Unhappy companies?

00:09:57.339 --> 00:09:59.400
Why are they Unhappy?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.830
They are Unhappy because they have Failed.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:07.149
And, they have Failed because they couldn’t
escape competition.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:12.209
So, we were talking about companies all this
while.

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:19.269
Imagine, for a moment, the same lesson for
the Individual.

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:26.660
Do you want to be a monopoly, or do you want
to compete?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:34.230
Do you want to be the fastest, the strongest,
the greatest, the tallest… among the people

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.339
in your army?

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:42.079
(Goliath) OR, do you want to be the only!

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:46.480
Goliath? he is BEST among the practitioners
of every warrior art form.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480
David?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.920
He is the only one who knows how to use that
slingshot!

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.220
And, who won?!

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:59.180
So, do you want to be the Competitor or do
you want to be the Monopolist?

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:09.470
Seth Godin, when talking about the same concept,
gives us the example of the Shoeshine.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.510
Little kids self-employed, sitting at the
entrance to railway stations, shining the

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.660
shoes of ‘dignitaries’ who grace their
shop.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:22.890
You wipe the dust, shampoo the shoe, polish
it like a mirror, all the while the customer

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.020
sits in a grand seat above you.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.370
There are two ways to approach this job.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.139
You can identify the best spot.

00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:39.089
You can try to ensure there is no competition.

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:41.100
And you can work harder.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.810
And, that is the Competitive Mindset.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.480
What is the other mindset?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.720
The other mindset is “Why is this customer
here?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.029
Assume I get no other customer,.. that’s
okay.

00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:58.850
But, can I get this customer to come to me
again?

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.870
Is he here to get his shoes polished?

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:08.760
Or, is he here to take in the chill breeze
for about ten minutes?

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.110
Or, is he here just for the kingly treatment
he gets?

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.290
The feeling of royalty, albeit for just five
minutes..?

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.880
A servant at my feet!

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.920
Doing my bidding!”

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:25.350
When you start trying to understand the story
that the customer is telling themselves, and

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:34.600
relate to it, and provide your story overlapping
to it, there lies the Monopolist Mindset.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.399
No matter, if another kid down the road sets
up shop!

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:44.180
Because, he knows that he can get the ‘special
treatment’ only in your shop!

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.720
Again, from the world of business, to the
world of individuals!

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.010
Can you draw a line?

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.160
Can you understand what is the right way to
compare?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.850
There is a book by this name.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.910
Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving
a F*ck.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.139
There is a beautiful example featured in this
book.

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:06.649
This is Dave Mustaine.

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:08.260
Gives amazing performances.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.589
Get a great name.

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:15.310
A band forms around him.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:22.500
The band is about to release its first album,
and at that time, the manager calls this guy

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.690
and gives him the boot!

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.920
“Sorry, you are out!”

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.139
He is very upset.

00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:30.370
He is very angry.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.010
He decides to himself — I need to prove
a point.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.010
I have to do well.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.010
He goes to Los Angeles.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.010
Creates another band.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.040
And, it becomes a successful band.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.360
Sells 25 million albums.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.839
Megadeth it is!

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:47.290
But, is Dave Mustaine happy?

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.390
It has sold 25 million albums!

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.910
Why wouldn’t you be happy?!

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.320
But, he says, in an interview…

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.769
The band I was kicked out of is Metallica!

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:06.050
They have sold 180 million albums!

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.990
In their view, I am still a failure.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.410
But wait..

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.490
Take a look at a very similar comparison.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.720
I know a guy.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.750
Who got kicked out of a prestigious engineering
college.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.750
IIT Madras!

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.750
Kicked out!

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.320
He indulged in mischief.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.500
He got kicked out.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:33.329
But, you meet him today and ask him…

00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:37.930
He is going to say, “I don’t regret being
kicked out.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.690
Everything happened for good.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:44.720
Because, .. if I hadn’t been kicked out,
I wouldn’t have met my wife!

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.660
My future wife!”

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.949
Mindset.

00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:52.239
Perspective.

00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:59.100
Are you going to compare yourself with all
the other IIT graduates who went abroad, became

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:07.440
CEOs, and achieved amazing things, .. or,
are you going to compare with what other things

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.949
could have happened if you hadn’t met your
wife?

00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:18.070
And, all the goodness that came your way,
simply because you were kicked out?!

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:23.399
Many people call social media bad.

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:29.029
I have been thinking, Social Media may actually
be good!

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:33.870
Because, it is starting to show us the absolute
best..

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:40.050
Once upon a time, if there was a village,
you could be the best singer in the village..

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:45.779
And a far better singer could be in the adjoining
village and you wouldn’t know about it all

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.130
your life…

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:57.610
On the other hand, today, on YouTube, on SoundCloud,
on Tiktok, .. you get to know something that

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.350
somebody somewhere far away did, in Korea
and China.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:06.399
And so the absolute world standard, is out
there.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:12.760
So, you no longer compare with your colleague,
with your friend, with your next door neighbour.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.420
Because, you may be better than them, they
may be better than you, but both of you suck

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.120
with the gold standard.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.139
And today, you have access to the gold standard.

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:26.190
The same thing I think about Open AI too.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.210
Its drawing capability..

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.210
MidJourney.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.970
Dall-E. Or, its intelligent chat capability..

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:36.490
If you look at these, on the one hand, you
get a shiver down your spine.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.190
On the other hand, you get a feeling, “Thank
God!

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.509
This is is a boon!

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:47.019
Anybody can write a letter?

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:48.519
Good.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:53.790
No longer do we need to obsess about these
little, cheap things like can you spell a

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:59.620
word well, can you write a grammatically error-free
sentence..

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.350
No longer do we need to obsess about those
low-level things.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.620
Let us talk at a higher level!”

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.059
I am happy, hence, that these things are happening.

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:13.470
We have talked “comparisons” for quite
a while now.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.870
I am sure you have listened to this yarn too..

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.870
“Oh..

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.169
Don’t compare yourself with others.

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:21.890
There is only one thing you need to compare
with.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.890
And that..?

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.589
Is who you were yesterday..

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.319
Have you become better today..

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.530
Use that as your benchmark.”

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.230
And, my message for such people?

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.230
Is this.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.290
Today’s Michael Jordan..

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.669
can he compare himself with the Michael Jordan
of twenty years ago?

00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:40.950
He is getting older!

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.110
He is getting slower!

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:48.000
— Look at him, almost daring his older counterpart
for a quick pickup game!

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.560
So.. what’s the solution then?

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.640
How can you compare yourself with others?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640
You can’t.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.390
With your own past..

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.820
You may not be able to..

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.559
For, you may be over the top.

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:04.460
Over the top of the hill.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.660
Going downhill.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.710
So, what are you going to do..?

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.909
I searched far and wide.

00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:13.659
And, I have just one answer for you.

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:17.340
And that comes from this book called One.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.809
By Richard Bach.

00:18:19.809 --> 00:18:22.549
He is a fighter-jet pilot turned author.

00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:24.520
We have encountered him earlier too.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.090
In Jonathan Livingston Seagull.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:35.040
He says, “I gave my life to become the person
I am right now.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.260
Was it worth it?”

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.670
Ask this question.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.260
You may have gained some skills.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.440
You may have lost some touch.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.840
You may have earned some experiences.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.820
You may have suffered some scars.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.820
But, the sum total of that…

00:18:53.820 --> 00:19:01.660
All that together.. is the person standing
in that square foot of ground beneath you.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.010
Ask this question every day.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.640
Was it worth it?

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:14.040
That suffering, that pain, that challenge,
that victory, that joy, that sorrow, was it

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.940
worth it?

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.480
For who you are today!

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.380
That should surely be possible.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.700
Even for Michael Jordan.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.820
Always upswinging curve.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.130
As a closing thought, I want to tell you this
story.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.870
There was this king..

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.620
He had arthritic pain..

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.620
Unbearable.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.420
They call the King’s doctor.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:44.870
And he advises that if you wrap it tightly
with “Poduthalai”, you will lose the pain.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:54.570
They refer the dictionary and deduce that
it means “bald/shaved head”.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:20:03.150
They drag a guy with a shaved head, and … tie
his head to the king’s knee!

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.070
He gets really upset.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.810
Cries out in pain.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:17.500
Nor is the king’s arthritis getting any
better.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.049
They call the King’s doctor.

00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:24.460
Ask him why his advice isn’t working.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.789
And the doctor says, it is “Poduthazhai”..

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:28.740
It is a medicinal herb.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.750
I wanted you to tightly pack it around his
knee!

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:44.690
It is from this story that the Tamil phrase
“Mottaitthalaikkum Mozhanghaalukkum Mudicchu

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.380
Pottaarppol” came!

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:54.039
That contextless connection came from this
story.

00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:00.770
I wanted to just add that little bit because
we continue to do that comparison.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.580
Apples and Oranges.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:10.130
Let us learn to not do that.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.800
We will meet soon enough!

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.670
Thank you!
