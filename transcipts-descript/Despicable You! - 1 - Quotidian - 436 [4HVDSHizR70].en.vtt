00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.580
Long long ago, there was a well in a village…

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.130
A donkey, an ass, fell into that well, once.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.740
A big hole.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.340
A deep one.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.559
And, this ass fell into it.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:22.330
And it cried out aloud, tried calling the
farmer for help, but it was a little old and

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:31.000
the farmer thought, … it is not worth trying
to retrieve this donkey, so, let me just leave

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.510
it… ‘ass’ it is, and probably just bury
it there..

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.740
Anyway, this well is an old one, an empty
hole..

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.469
So, he started throwing dug up dirt into it.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.809
The ass cried, feeling bad that it wasn’t
being taken out..

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:58.219
But, over time, it realised that there WAS
a way out..

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.010
It shook off the dirt that was thrown on to
its back, .. converted that into an inclined

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.770
plane of steps, and this ass came out of that
hole!

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.009
This is the Asshole Story.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.290
Namaste!

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.570
Contemptible.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.860
Disdainful.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.140
Despicable.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.829
Remember that DonkeyPit we talked about?

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:41.350
It is about those DonkeyPits that we are going
to talk about today.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:49.270
In fact, we are going to do it in TWO episodes.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.399
This is Bob Sutton.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.290
We have met him earlier.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.770
We have seen his books.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.149
He is a specialist in DonkeyPits.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:12.129
So, a book like this one, another like this
one (about how to escape from them), and what

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:19.430
if those people became Bosses.. how to handle
that.. a book for that.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.430
He is a specialist.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.280
A specialist in DonkeyPits.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.610
So, what is he saying?

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.709
He says, first of all, everybody goes through
that phase.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:34.950
Every one of them.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.420
In the previous episode, we encountered tantrums
of children..

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.409
The Tamil word “Thanthiram”.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.409
Remember?

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:48.680
Similarly, the tantrum of the child and the
behaviour, the attitude, the personality,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:59.690
of the employee or the team mate, or even
the boss, … will fall into two categories.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.019
One?

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.200
A phase that all of us have to tolerate and
put up with.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.090
That is the Temporary DonkeyPit.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:18.740
Every one of us, we end up being DonkeyPits
at least for SOME TIME, SOME DAY, SOME SITUATION.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.680
The same holds true for children too.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.600
They are not in control, they simply “lose
it”.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.830
But, this is okay.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.830
Forgivable.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.760
The second KIND of people?

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.340
They are called Certified DonkeyPits.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.340
Why?

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.980
The child KNOWS that he is demonstrating a
tantrum.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.650
He knows that only by throwing a tantrum he
can bend you to his will.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.170
And, he knows that he is doing that only to
achieve that end.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:59.819
“I know.. I am switching to tantrum mode
just so I can bend you to play it my way”.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:09.310
Similarly, there are bosses, there are colleagues,
there are teammates, who are Certified DonkeyPits.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.280
How to handle that second type?

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.870
How to escape?

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.100
How to not be such a person?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.160
How to spot such a person?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
Let’s see..

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.180
A short checklist..!

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.020
Could this person be a DonkeyPit?

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.110
Yes, they will not let you talk!

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.270
In Tamil, they have this phrase, “Cycle
Gap..la”..

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.840
You can’t get a word in edgewise!

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.940
They will just rule the conversation.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.360
They will own it.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.030
They will not acknowledge your presence.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.979
You can also find out if they are a DonkeyPit
by looking at the Questions versus Statements

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.919
ratio..

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.210
Are they asking at least a few questions?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.250
Is this correct?

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.400
Is it right to do it this way?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.000
Is this possible for you?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Nope.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Everything is a declaration.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
A statement.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.560
An opinion, stated as a fact!

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.010
DonkeyPit Indicator!

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.130
How about their volunteering ability?

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.720
Somebody wants to do something, no no, I have
my work to do.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.940
Somebody wants you to help..

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.250
No no, that’s not what I am being paid for.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.080
Typical jerk attitude.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.180
Also, they are territorial.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.690
They will not interfere in somebody else’s
work, oh, sometimes they do, but they will

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.699
not allow anybody to interfere in their work.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.180
Can I take a look?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.259
Can I give you suggestions?

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.199
Can I review it?

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.229
NO!

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.639
They do not allow you to cross that boundary
line that they have drawn.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.669
Typical DonkeyPit attitude!

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.650
Also, they seem to lack emotions..

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:18.920
That “So what..”, “What if..”, “Why
do I care..”..

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
Attitude..

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.479
Yes, there is an emergency, but..

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.460
I have got my peanuts!

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.750
To crunch!

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.199
That attitude.

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.080
Again is an indicator that probably they are
borderline DonkeyPits.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.630
Also, that apathy.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.229
“I am not bothered about..”?

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:42.400
It can also become pessimism.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.430
This is just not going to work out.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.599
This is not going to happen.

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:49.599
That wet blanket.

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:55.570
If they walk, there would be a cloud over
their head, raining down on them!

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.820
There will be a shadow passing as they move
past you.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.650
People with such an attitude, .. all the kinds
of people described above, are typical DonkeyPit

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.650
people!

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.680
There is one more..

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.520
That I need to add to that checklist.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.280
I encountered that word in this special dictionary.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:29.160
John Koenig, the author of this dictionary,
has collected words from various, strange,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.569
international languages..

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:31.810
Sorry, he says.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.730
There are no words for such stuff in the English
language!

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.820
I have picked these Japanese and Finnish and
other such words and I am telling you that

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.690
this word means this in that place.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.810
And, to recreate that emotion, we don’t
have an English word, please use that word

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.280
as it is!!

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.220
A word like that, is “Sonder”.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.199
From The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.910
The word “Sonder” means this.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.979
It is a noun..

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:09.340
You see a person on the road.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.180
Some random woman or man.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.870
Do you have any understanding that they could
be living an equally complicated, complex,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.940
challenged, troubled life?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:28.229
Or, are you the only Hero there is?!

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:32.539
Everybody else — bit players?

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.539
Look at those words.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:34.830
Vivid and complex.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.680
You think about your own life, your own universe..

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.040
The same desires, the same fears, that person
might be having.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:51.149
And, in that person’s life, in that person’s
view, you are just an extra!

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:53.779
Bit role player.

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:57.560
Remember the Bahubali movie?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.950
Every doorway will have two soldiers.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.560
Standing, with a spear and a shield.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.769
They will give way.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:05.420
That’s their role.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.460
Do you think all of us are like that?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.460
In your life?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:25.140
Or, do we have a family, a career, a desire,
a hobby, a pending job, a fear?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.140
That acknowledgement?

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.140
Is sonder.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.380
And so, if you don’t have sonder, DonkeyPit!!

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.399
I received this in Whatsapp, via a forward.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.399
Organisational hierarchy.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.399
Tree structure.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:40.870
Up above, there is the CEO.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.110
And, the structure goes..

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:56.160
Yes, CEO, Executives, Managers, .. and so
on.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.910
Do you realise what’s happening?

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:06.579
Simply because of the way this has been structured,
from down below, when you look upwards, every

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:15.399
one of those people, or birds, when they look
up, they see ONLY DonkeyPits!

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:16.399
And..?

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:21.340
When people look from above, downwards?

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.829
All the bosses and managers, and the leaders,
when they look downwards?

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:30.540
They see only shit!!

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.649
This is probably the inescapable reality of
how teams are structured…

00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:36.649
Is it not?

00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:43.940
If we seat them in this way, this is the problem,
dear folks!

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.570
“Ahan, nope!

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.339
I have never seen a DonkeyPit in my team!

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:50.029
We are the best!

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:52.330
We are the closest!

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.480
Amazing chemistry!”

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.149
— Seems, there is an important phrase..

00:10:57.149 --> 00:10:58.839
Like a proverb..

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:06.260
Print it and stick it on to your secret cupboard,
and read it daily, advises the author!

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:12.600
The phrase goes: “If you are looking for
a DonkeyPit in your team, and you are not

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:19.269
able to find one, … YOU could be that!”

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:21.209
Ouch!

00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:22.410
Reflect on it!

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.580
It could well be you!

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.060
Because, there is nothing called a “No DonkeyPit
team!”

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.990
Think about that!

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.190
Why should we be afraid of it??

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.590
Let us consider an average apple.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.180
Slightly diseased apple.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.830
Troublesome.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.470
Infected.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.470
Starting to decay.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.430
A normal apple.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:54.399
If I keep a healthy, super-good apple…

00:11:54.399 --> 00:12:01.529
can I hope to improve the average apple in
the middle?

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:02.829
“See, look at me..

00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:04.050
I am a superstar!

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.050
I am a performer!

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.290
Learn from me!

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.850
Be influenced by me!

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.061
Have a positive impact!

00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:11.061
Be motivated!”

00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:16.490
Yes, probably, in some rare cases, this might
be possible, but, in the world of apples at

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.760
least, that is not gonna happen!

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760
BUT…!

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:30.779
What if, I introduced this person, a rotten
apple, an infected apple, the bad apple, next

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:31.990
to that person?

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:37.870
What do you think will happen??

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.820
Three days!

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.130
This is what’s gonna happen!

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.300
This is classic.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:48.680
In a team, it doesn’t matter what kind of
superstar performers you have.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.450
The chain is only as strong as its weakest
link.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.480
What matters is, .. have you ensure there
are no DonkeyPits!?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.290
Having spotted a DonkeyPit, have you ensured
that they have been kicked out of the team

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.060
and the company?

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:14.279
Hard conversations, tough conversations, but
have you had them?

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:17.769
Closing thought..

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:22.329
the author who had written about those DonkeyPits..,
Sutton, says, “That infection doesn’t

00:13:22.329 --> 00:13:33.199
just spread from the bad apple to the good
apple.. not just that, it started affecting

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:35.130
the people handling the apples!”

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.410
We have seen this in the covid story.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:44.390
So many nurses got infected simply because
they were treating people with covid.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.529
That virus.

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:50.300
Some nurses even died, I remember.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:57.930
Similarly, towards the end of his research,
Robert Sutton says, “My wife started saying

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.529
‘you have changed, you have become such
a jerk!

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:04.870
What happened to the gentleman in you?!’

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.899
Why did this happen?

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:15.140
When there is a rotten apple, and it has not
been removed from the barrel, yes, the rotten

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:20.480
apple has the power to influence the others,
yes, but not just that..

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.180
The other apples next to this rotten one,
look at it and start thinking aloud..

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:31.220
“Hey, our Master is tolerating the behaviour
of such a rotten apple too, he is retaining

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:39.110
this one.. why should I struggle and work
extra hard and maintain my health and chemistry?

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.050
Let me also slip into lethargy and rot!

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.790
Feet on table, pillow balancing the back and
head, leaning back and enjoying Netflix on

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.660
a working day at office!”

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:58.899
That attitude seems OK if you allow a DonkeyPit
to continue!

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:04.540
That is the problem!

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.760
There is a Part Two to this.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.950
We will meet again, very soon!
