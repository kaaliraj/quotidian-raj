00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.730
So we all know that story..

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
The king has probably one or two kids..

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:17.150
And the mom dies.. and the king remarries..
and the EVIL stepmother comes and gives impossible

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.880
tasks to the princes.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.070
She calls them one by one, and tells them,
these are the things you have to do, .. take

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.759
a couple of your soldiers, and using those
soldiers, get this done.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.309
And, what are those ‘impossible’ tasks?

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.120
Bring the elephant to the first-floor balcony…

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.100
Then, you have to boil the ocean.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.250
And.. count the number of grains in the sea-shore..

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.250
Just bring the right tally number, down to
the last digit.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.570
And, a cup of yogurt from the milk one gets
from the Palace Bull.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.150
One prince comes, and says, sorry, I can’t,
the other prince comes, gets angry, gives

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.550
up, but the third prince, he is happy..

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.570
He is smiling.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:23.350
Guess why?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.909
Namaste!

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.909
Four hundred and twenty-eight.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.870
That story featuring the king, the queen,
the stepmother, and those three princes..

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.460
We were looking at that, weren’t we?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.690
Why was that third guy happy?

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.479
You know why?

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.850
He was happy because the Evil Stepmother Queen
had said, “You, and a couple of soldiers”…

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.890
but she hadn’t specified who to take along…

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.520
“I can pick my team!, I can pick my super-performers!”

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.690
That made that guy happy.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.429
That confidence…

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.830
“If given the right people, I can boil the
ocean!

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.390
I can milk the bull!”

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.580
That is the whole concept of putting the right
team together.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.950
If you get on the internet and do some searching,
you will probably find a million articles

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:37.270
about interviewing skills and the right way
to attract talent.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.150
I read a few of them, myself.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.250
Particularly the ones that were intriguing,
interesting, unusual..

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.050
I thought it would be a good idea to put them
all together.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.590
I have used some of those in my own life.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:00.800
And, I am going to throw it at you and see
how 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800
you react.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.910
First up, let us all understand this..

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.500
Something we should all understand and internalise.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.799
Particularly, if we are in the IT / Hitech
field..

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.640
“The Leader doesn’t know everything!”.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.909
A few years ago, this concept called the Servant
Leadership spread far and wide.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:28.110
“The person above is not supposed to be
taken care of by everybody below them…

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:37.650
The person above is not the “Command and
Control” person, but, they should instead

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.089
strive to EMPOWER.

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.930
They should put effort to demonstrate the
servant-leadership structure.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.930
My primary role is to resolve any problems
you may be facing.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.930
Obstacle Remover.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.930
Vigna Vinaayak.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.930
You do your work.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.930
You are amazing.”

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.300
That is the first understanding we need to
have when thinking about growing our team.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.659
It is not command and control.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.890
It is serve and help remove obstacles.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.470
You search for Leadership, and you are immediately
greeted by pictures like this..!

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.790
But, guess what is the unstated fact of the
matter in this picture?

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.150
The Leader is the one BELOW!

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:32.060
Because, the truth is, whether you agree or
not, based on my personal experience, the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.020
millennials, the post-millennials who are
crowding these high-technology environments,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.530
they can run circles around us… oldies.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.690
Oh, yes, they would immediately quip, “We
have wisdom, you just have knowledge!…

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.110
We have experience!”..

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.060
oh, yes, all that is true.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:04.780
But, when it comes to raw work, that horsepower,
getting things done, putting hand to code,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:13.620
conceiving, creating, coding, debugging, fixing,
launching, leave these guys alone.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.720
These guys and girls.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.620
They will do such a good job, you will be
left panting!

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.009
So, the idea is, please do not think, “I
can do this easily..

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.940
If only I have the time..

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.790
I am looking for a teammate only because I
don’t have the time for it..”

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.140
You are supposed to attract talent that can
do far better than you.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.660
In the work that matters.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.870
Please understand that, when talking about
growing your team.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.870
This is Ricardo Semler.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.539
Semco is a very large oil conglomerate company
in Brazil.

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:04.030
He inherited that company from his father.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.569
He didn’t like how the company was performing,
and when he dug deeper, he didn’t like how

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.640
the company was structured.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:22.789
So, he became the Chief Empowerment Officer
of the company, and came up with beautiful

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:23.789
ideas.

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.970
He is at it still.. in the fields of education
and leadership.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.970
He is teaching the world many of his philosophies.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.210
He has penned these two books too.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.210
Interesting ones.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.490
You can judge these two by the covers themselves!

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.560
The Seven-Day Weekend, and the Maverick.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.889
He wowed us with a lot of really controversial
counter-intuitive ideas!

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.009
One of those ideas?

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:54.430
I personally was very intrigued when I read
about it, and I implemented it too, in my

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.430
team.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.960
And, it was pretty interesting.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.340
That idea is about recruitment.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.990
Say, we have a hierarchical structure like
this.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.270
This green-person has left and the slot is
empty.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.570
And, we are going to recruit a person to fill
that place.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.160
Elsewhere, in most companies, you know how
the interview structure would be?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.780
This person, because of the direct reporting
structure, this person will interview.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.389
Probably boss’s boss..

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:28.740
She may want to have a look too.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.669
And, rarely, but yes, sometimes, they will
also invite the sideways boss..

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.919
“Sir, please, join me in evaluating somebody
who is joining my team…

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.339
Give me your thoughts..”

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:42.360
That is where the matter will end.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.789
But, do you know how it would go in Semco?

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:50.000
This is how it would go.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.940
At Semco, that same slot… it will be interviewed
by THIS person.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.940
Peer interview.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.200
“Is somebody coming into this company for
a role similar to mine?

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.470
I would like to know about them!”

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.979
And this person..

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:11.849
And, these people..

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.430
They are going to be immediately managed by
this person..

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.750
“I am not sure if they understood the culture
well enough..

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.889
How our company works..

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:23.030
What makes it tick…

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.830
No idea if they know about it..

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:32.200
My day to day work, my long term goals, this
is the person who is going to drive..

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.260
I would like to have a say..

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.500
I have been here in this company for quite
some time..”

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.659
Why!

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.969
Even these!

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:41.969
Even these people!

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:46.680
Because that division is going to be managed
by this man or this woman..

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.840
Can we get inputs??

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.149
That was the philosophy at Semco!

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:52.170
Okay, you have to interviewed…

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.390
yes, of course, it is a respectful, two-way
interview.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:06.990
But he ensured that people under that empty
slot had a say in deciding who comes in.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:13.680
And that helped the company, and the bottomline
really shot up, it became very famous, amazing

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680
story..

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.970
Read the books for more details!

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.209
This, is Joel Spolsky.

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:28.000
Joel Spolsky is famous in programmer / techie
circles as a startup founder, but also as

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.010
a visionary thinker.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.910
He has written quite a few books, and he has
a famous blog too.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.350
A blog that is still running, after all these
years!

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.370
Fog Creek Software was the company he founded.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:47.340
Again, lots of interesting, twisty, unusual
philosophies that he propagated.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.089
One of them is about the camel hump.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.649
This is an Arabian camel.

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:54.390
We have seen quite a few members of this species.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.260
Dromedary, they call it.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.530
But, there is another camel type too.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.400
Bactrian, they call it.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.809
Inhabits “cold deserts”.

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:03.809
One hump.

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:04.910
Two humps.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.240
That is the most important difference!

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.070
Talking about humps, you would immediately
look at it as the normalised bell curve.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.880
Poor performers, average performers, top performers.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.019
People who don’t know anything at all, people
who know a little bit, people who know very

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:27.019
well..

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:28.649
Always, the bell curve!

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:33.019
Even Virat Kohli’s scores in T20 cricket?

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:35.610
Bell curve!

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.910
But…

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:46.149
Joel Spolsky says, the bell curve distribution
for people who can do good software is not

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:49.470
a Dromedary, but is actually a Bactrian!

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.589
That would mean, it would look something like
this.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:57.889
The curve on the left?

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:01.730
The curve of those who don’t know anything
about programming!

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:07.899
But, because of good communication skills
or a flashy demeanour, they somehow go to

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:16.620
the right extreme and we, when interviewing
them, think they are the left extreme of the

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.950
curve of the people who really know how to
program!

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:26.150
So, if you are going to interview somebody,
the most important task ahead of you is to

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:31.339
find out which curve the person is actually
falling on..!

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:37.920
Because, … if that person is belonging to
the previous curve, the one where they don’t

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.960
know the fundamentals but they are having
the street-smarts to look as if they know

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.960
everything…

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.440
you are done for!

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:52.820
If you involve a person like that in your
company, in your team, that would be the end

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.899
of you!

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:56.139
Ensure they are in the right-side-curve.

00:11:56.139 --> 00:12:00.040
How do you do that?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.519
There is this professor..

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.040
Serge Lang.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.709
He is a Calculus kingpin.

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:12.220
Many textbooks of mathematics in the US college
curriculum were actually authored by him.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.529
He would appear in the classroom, first day,
first show, of his course..

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:18.540
Advanced Calculus.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.610
And he would conduct a silly-simple test..

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.660
Okay!

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.920
Solve the system of equations, .. what is
the sine of….

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.920
Show that…

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.440
A very simple set.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.540
Finish it in fifteen minutes…!

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.540
His theory?

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.839
Based on observing generations of students
pass through his portals year after year?

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:43.000
(He has got empirical evidence at least!)

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:55.720
His theory is, if you do something silly-simple,
very fast, you have a chance, you stand a

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.180
chance, for doing well in the hard complex
stuff..

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:11.389
If you are going to someday be proficient
with the advanced stuff, you would crack these

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:14.199
silly-simple things blindingly fast, correctly,
just like that!

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:20.700
You take it or leave it, but this man is famous
for having done this across generations of

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.440
students, and there is some data to prove
what he is saying is right.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.190
What is the computer science equivalent of
this?

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.190
Well…

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:36.080
Typically, if you are called for a coding
interview, you would face a “Fizzbuzz”

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080
problem..

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080
What is that?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.329
You have numbers 1 to 15…

00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:42.329
Or, even 1 to…

00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:43.329
N. Perhaps 10,000.

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:45.200
You have to print these on the screen.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.610
But, while printing, all multiples of three,
you will have to print Fizz instead, all multiples

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.860
of five, you will have to print Buzz instead,
and … three and five?

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.170
If the number is a multiple of both of these,
print FizzBuzz instead!

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.710
It is pretty famous..

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:05.550
Just a simple query on Google will show you
articles about the “famous” FizzBuzz problem,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.550
etc.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:15.829
Might look silly, but, even here, what algorithm
are you going to use, how efficient, how much

00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:21.759
space, how much time, is it going to be occupying…

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:26.440
These will be the parameters that will perhaps
showcase your ability!

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.100
While interviewing, they give us three warnings..

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.310
To beware of.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.130
Three things to NOT END UP DOING!

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.970
The first warning is, just don’t be the
Quiz Master.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:38.970
Whack.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.149
Here is my question.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:41.889
There is your answer.

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:42.889
Whack again.

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:44.510
Here is another question.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.250
There is your answer.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.250
Whack again and again.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.250
Back and forth.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.250
Won’t work!

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.250
It is not some trivia contest..

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.760
Programming, particularly?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.760
Software?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.279
Building software?

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:58.380
Is not about you remembering the difference
between varchar1 and varchar2.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.380
No.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.360
That’s not how it works.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.420
Right now, we have tools that will intelligently
recommend to you, prompt to you, without cutting

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:14.540
your flow of thought, to help you with problems
in your code, in your syntax.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:22.320
The attempt here should not be about quizzing
the other person with short questions.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.639
At the same time, do not become this kind
of interviewer.

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:34.560
The interviewer who… asks everything they
know.. allowing only very short ripostes from

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.660
the interviewee..

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:45.790
Probably you are boasting about your ability,
your knowledge, you are not interested in

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.590
asking the person to demonstrate what they
know!

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.720
And, the third little warning?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.690
Some interviewers have this strategy..

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:02.560
They say, “I want to put that person in
a situation of discomfort.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.411
I want to throw them into the middle of the
deep sea!

00:16:04.411 --> 00:16:07.019
I want to see how they survive..

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:10.279
I want to see how they swim to safety.

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.790
I want to see how they save themselves from
drowning!

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.529
That is a test of their character!”

00:16:15.529 --> 00:16:17.310
they would say.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.579
That is what they do..

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:23.220
This is what they end up going through.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:30.250
Probably, yes, there are sometimes when such
an interview works, but most of the time,

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:35.940
you are testing them for an environment they
would never be in, hopefully.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.860
If your company is a well-run one, if your
company and your team respect their employees,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:49.110
if you are a company that doesn’t foist
unnecessary artificial pressure on your employees,

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.660
then, this is not what they will ever go through
again, is it not?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.000
So, what is the point then, exposing them
to something like this?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.870
Instead, why don’t you find out what they
know really, and find out whether they know

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:08.350
it really!

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.920
Put them at ease.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.920
Have a coffee.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.709
Go on a walk around campus.

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:18.060
That is what you should aim for.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.220
Calm.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.380
Relax.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.860
Take it easy.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.539
And then find out what they are capable of.

00:17:26.539 --> 00:17:30.100
There is this other matter of “Experience”.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.660
I have done this for ten years.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.710
I am a fifteen-years-experienced Java expert…

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.200
Do not fall for this experience myth.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.179
For, there are two kinds of people…

00:17:46.179 --> 00:17:48.059
The “young upstarts” who mature amazingly
fast.

00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:52.150
“I have been with it for just six months
but I know it inside out.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.360
I know..

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.760
There is nothing more for me to actively learn.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.850
It is only about active implementation and
experimentation” — they say..

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.640
Similarly, the eternally raw, immature folks
exist too.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.690
Ten years experienced, they would claim.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.700
But no.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.929
They have just experienced the first year
ten times.

00:18:13.929 --> 00:18:16.730
Do you want that?

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.450
Do you want a person who hasn’t explored
the edges of knowledge?

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.610
So, don’t fall for that Experience Myth.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:33.320
In fact there are a lot of applicants who,
actively search out, and if they see this

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.840
phrase “Number of years of experience”
in a job application, they actively CHOOSE

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840
not to go to that company..

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.690
For, if you are a company that respects this
kinda stuff, I know what kinda company you

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:49.520
are.. they conclude and they keep away.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.940
Finally, in any team environment there will
always be problems.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.530
They have researched this much.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:02.480
Interviewed numerous people in numerous occasions,
and arrived at this conclusion.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.810
It could SEEM like any kind of problem.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:07.900
Code problem.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.100
Deadline problem.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.620
Demo problem.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.410
Customer understanding problem.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.070
Market fitment problem.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.419
Whatever it may seem like…

00:19:17.419 --> 00:19:27.110
But, if you analyse and get to the root cause,
you will realise that it is a PEOPLE problem.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:35.520
And so, whoever you end up choosing, however
superman-wonderwoman-grade the person is,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.140
ensure they know how to work with other people.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:45.539
Because, there is no concept of a single lone
wolf ever launching something amazing.

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:49.289
You have to work with people.

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:57.020
And, that tall claim that people make about
recruiting the Top One Percent of candidates..!

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.450
I look at one hundred people, and select just
one among them…

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.450
Farcical.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:10.380
Please realise, probably some of the best
candidates aren’t even in the market.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.000
Please remember that.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.430
You are selecting the top one percent of the
people who are applying, who are floating

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.260
around in the job market, who are applying
to your company.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.110
Don’t foolishly call that Top One Percent!

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:31.840
Have that humility!

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.460
As a closing thought, here is a commentary
about résumés.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.950
You know this person.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.690
Jack Ma.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.530
But, did you know?

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:52.419
When he was fifteen years old, he had a pen
pal in Australia, to whom he would write letters

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:57.460
in broken English… (he became an English
teacher by the way, before he became the CEO

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.799
of Alibaba!)..

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:05.299
that letter used to be written in double-spacing..

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:06.669
Why?

00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:12.350
That other boy would correct his English,
the spelling, grammar, style, and send it

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.070
back to him!

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.529
Did you know!

00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:16.880
It shows grit!

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.610
Oprah Winfrey.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:23.809
Molested at the age of fourteen.

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:26.620
She became pregnant.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.140
The baby died.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.809
What kind of impact that would have had on
her life?

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:36.659
Would we have known?

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:39.070
What about Mark Zuckerberg..?

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:43.250
At one point of time, he was in a dilemma..

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:50.460
Should I focus my energies on Facebook, or
should I instead build Wirehog, this new amazing

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.490
tool for filesharing that I have come up with
working from my dorm?!

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.460
What made him choose Facebook?

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.580
Do we have an insight into it?

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:07.350
What about Bill Gates?

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:14.580
Paul Allen and he, went to a computer company
in the neighbourhood.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.299
Promised to “find bugs” in the system.

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:23.970
And, instead of money in return, they just
asked for time at the computer, as a return

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:24.970
favour!

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.230
What kind of innovation is that?

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.870
What kind of go-getting mentality is that?

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:38.010
Well then, these four stories that we saw,
would we ever be able to see those in their

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.010
résumés?

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.380
Would they ever talk about it?

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.169
Their failures, their challenges, their childhood-impactful-moments?

00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:48.830
We will never be able to gather that.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:54.970
So, your aim, as an interviewer, .. if somebody
offers you their résumé, just place it respectfully

00:22:54.970 --> 00:23:00.360
to the side, and understand the movie of their
life.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.169
Take them back in time.

00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:04.720
Look for those trigger points.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.890
Those turning moments.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.950
Understand how they have reacted.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.610
Understand how they have adjusted.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.610
Adopted.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:12.610
Adapted.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:18.350
That will tell you a better story than any
paper résumé.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.100
Don’t you agree?!

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:30.970
Alright, let us meet again in just a few more
days!

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.010
Thank you!
