00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:01.849
Namaste!

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:08.884
Yesterday, we were looking at this gorilla,
remember?

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:13.040
And, we highlighted that self-deception is
perhaps the worst of all deceptions.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.309
Of all the ways one can be deceived…

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.566
Plato had pointed out that when you cheat
yourself and delude yourself.

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:29.363
And, I had left a small clue for you. A cartoon.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:32.780
Today, we are going to talk about another
kind of gorilla.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.999
This gorilla even has a name.

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.699
It is called the 800-pound gorilla.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.620
That is what they call it.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.690
What is it actually?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.219
Well.. there is a family.. or a meeting room
full of people.. a gathering of senior folks.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.269
And, while discussing and debating, everybody
seems to be talking about everything except

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.690
that one single very big, very huge problem
or thing or person, they seem to avoid just

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.269
that one HUGE issue.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.159
They waste time beating around the bush…

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.289
They seem to want to be politically correct,
do just their job, and not address the biggest

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.289
issue.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:18.710
That is when people exclaim, “We are not
addressing the 800-pound-gorilla in the room”.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.210
It is sitting.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.210
Large.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.210
Immobile.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.210
Unshakeable.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.450
We need to address that one first.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.609
If we don’t fix that one, nothing else really
matters.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:36.189
The 800-pound-gorilla is the most important
problem nobody talks about.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:43.820
Quite some time ago, talking about organisational
structure, a CEO, people under them, people

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.840
further downwards, a tree, branches, leaves,
a cartoonist had drawn some interesting structures.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.579
Can you guess which company this one is, he
quipped.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.179
In this particular case, there seems to be
one central celebrity-person in the middle,

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.240
his word seems to be law here, he observes
everything that is going on, well.. the answer

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240
is Apple.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.939
In the time of Steve Jobs.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.520
How about this one?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.500
Everybody talking to everybody else…

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.080
Three dots on top.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
Only the middle dot seems to be handling all
management.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.400
The other two seem to have moved on, minding
their own next adventures..

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.580
Can you guess which company this one is?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.630
Sergey Brin.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.670
Larry Page.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.720
Sundar Pitchai.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720
Google.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.490
This one was good too.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.220
And, then, he showed one more picture.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.880
A structure with no structure or organisation.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.250
With no clear view of who was owning what,
reporting to whom, a company that seems to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.940
allow anybody to do anything… which company
is that, in recent times, … Connecting people?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.940
Facebook!

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.560
But, the one cartoon that most people laughed
about, mockingly nodded in acceptance though,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560
was this one.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.110
This art shows a company with many smaller
teams.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.260
And, these teams seem to be warring against
each other.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.150
And, the cartoonist labeled this as Microsoft.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.410
Today’s CEO at the helm of Microsoft is
Satya Nadella.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.920
He has written a book.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.870
People usually write books after they retire,
after they are done with their duties.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.540
But, he has written one while in active leadership.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.390
In this book, titled Hit Refresh, he starts
thus in the first chapter.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.590
Let me skim through it fast for you.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.270
“I joined Microsoft in 1992.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.239
With grand dreams and desires.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.330
Microsoft had already achieved much and had
a glorious name.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.920
But now though, the situation has changed
a bit.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.420
Innovation seems to be missing.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.080
Bureaucracy has crept in.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.610
Teamwork is absent.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.710
Politics is prevalent.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.693
We have fallen behind.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:04:00.491
And, in the midst of these troubled times,
a cartoonist drew the Microsoft organisation

00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:05.996
chart as warring gangs, each pointing a gun
at another.”

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:10.042
“I agree. It can’t be ignored.

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:13.337
I have been here quite a long time. It really hurt me.

00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:20.469
But, what upset me more was that our own people
just accepted it, without seeming to be hurt.

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.596
It really upset me. But, I knew this could be fixed.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:26.099
So, when I became CEO, and took my first steps
in my new role, I told employees that this

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.810
is the change that I want to bring about.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:38.946
I am going to change the culture. This a classic case of addressing the gorilla.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.030
If he had skipped this part, whatever else
he had talked about, everybody would have

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:48.413
mocked him behind his back, “Hey, we have
seen cartoons about Microsoft.

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:53.710
You blaze guns at each other, we heard.”

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.006
But, now that he laid it out plainly up front,
respect for him goes up, attention is grabbed.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.425
My dad used to advise me.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:07.140
There is a trick for those who slip and fall
on a banana peel, if you don’t want others laughing out loud at you.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.540
The trick is to be the loudest person to laugh,
the first person to laugh.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.020
If you can laugh uncontrollably looking at
your own self, they will come over to help

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.230
you, they may also join you in the light laugh,
or just leave you be.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.790
So, if you can address the gorilla, just like
Satya Nadella did, you really get extra credit.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.600
That was an amazing thing he did.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.960
A really good book.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.300
I recommend that you also read the book.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.870
But, before I leave, just a little nitpick
about the book.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.870
Let me find a small “fault”.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.130
The thing is, “Hit Refresh” means… to
get the latest version or update something

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.310
you already have.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.889
Get the most recent.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.260
But, that’s so old and previous-century.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.410
Today, we live in the world of Saas.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.610
In this world, even if you do nothing, if
something has changed at the server, you will

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.639
be sent an update, “Here, take this, this
is the latest”, that is the world we live

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.639
in.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.220
Why would anybody want to “Hit Refresh”
in this kind of a world, I wonder.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.800
I felt a bit bad.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.560
:-) But, otherwise, very good book, go ahead,
read it!

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.060
Thank you!
