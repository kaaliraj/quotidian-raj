00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:11.170
Have you heard of James Bond? The 007! The
British Agent. Secret Agent. One of his amazing

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.980
adventures.. one of the books.. is called
“You Only Live Twice!” In this book, there

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:26.240
are quite a few references to the Japanese
culture, the Japanese way of life, some Japanese

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:37.390
words too. In fact, in that book, he is referred
to as “Bondo-san”! Respectable Sir Bond!

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.640
James Bond will do a small favour to somebody..
And his friend will take him away privately

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.370
and mourn.. “Ouch, you have made a big mistake..!”
“Hey, I helped him after all”, Bond would

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.510
say, to which his friend would respond with,
“In Japanese, there is this concept called

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:06.650
ON. And this ON is like an invisible currency..
you do a favour to somebody, you get an ON

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.979
on that person. That person has to give you
the opportunity to give a favour back.. Only

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:23.440
then, the ON will balance.. To be “obligated”..
To be “indebted”.. It seems it is such

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.500
a dishonour among the Japanese. Look at this,
meanwhile. This is the Twenty-Second Rule

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:44.009
for Life. In this rule, “Ask someone to
do you a small favour, so that they can ask

00:01:44.009 --> 00:02:01.229
you to do one in the future.” It looks a
bit confusing, puzzling, riddling, doesn’t

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:14.880
it? We are going to look at a dozen such..
Come running!

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.180
Namaste! Four hundred and fiftysix is about
twelve rules for living.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:30.209
This man is Jordan Peterson. And, a Canadian
researcher, author, professor, speaker, commentator..

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.731
media person. He is nearly infamous for his
controversial thoughts and opinions! This

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:43.530
man has written a book called the 12 Rules
For Life. It originally started as 42 rules.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.670
And then, became 25, then 16, finally became
12. We are going to have a jaunty ride through

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.170
these 12 rules. And, if you want to just get
a summary of what those 12 rules are, perhaps

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.590
you are better off heading somewhere else.
Because, I am going to probably give you my

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.610
commentary on them. Things that occur to me
when I look at his Rules. Let us get started.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.870
Rule Number One is “Stand up straight with
your shoulders back!” Stand erect. Shoulders

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:29.470
back. There is something about this body language..
They even call it neurolinguistic programming..

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:38.319
Your mood sets the posture. But wait, your
posture sets your mood. And, guess how important

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:47.409
this is, according to the scientific research
carried in this domain? Amy Cuddy, in her

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:59.849
TED talk about body posture, says, “Usain
Bolt didn’t perform that open-chested hands-towards-heaven

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:09.099
pose because he won the gold medal! Probably,
Usain Bolt won the gold medal BECAUSE he was

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:19.019
used to performing that pose.. Remember that
arrow-pose? Body language matters.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.520
Rule Number Two says, “Treat yourself like
someone you are responsible for helping!”

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:38.570
Take care of yourself too. In that book, he
talks about how beautifully, how well, people

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:49.780
take care of their pets. Dog shampoo. Dog
chocolate. Dog ice-cream. Dog combs. Dog hair

00:04:49.780 --> 00:05:01.199
ribbons. Dog pills. Toys to feed the pills
to the pets. But they don’t take care of

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.270
themselves as well. First, take care of yourself.
Only afterwards, come the others. Only if

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.389
you are healthy and hearty, can you tend to
the others. You can see it very clearly from

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:18.280
this lesson. This is an image you would have
seen if you had taken a flight, you would

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.740
have seen, this is how you wear a mask. and,
the hostess, the person who is guiding you

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.419
along about the safety precautions will say,
“If you are traveling with a child, please

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:41.939
remember, wear your mask first, before trying
to get one on to a child.” To put it simply,

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:48.100
you are not useful to anybody if you are dead.
So, first take care of yourself. A very good

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.860
lesson. Consider yourself to be somebody worthy
of being saved, being helped, being take care

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.169
of, being tended to! Many people don’t do
that. They burn themselves in their intent

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:09.150
interest to be helpful to others. You can
be more helpful if you only took care of yourself

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.480
a little more.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:19.800
Rule Number Three is about making friends..
Who do we pick as our friends? They want the

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.979
best for you.. The ministers who will call
a spade a spade.. remember? Only those who

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:32.860
can point out my flaws, I want to allow near
me! Ralph Waldo Emerson, thinker, philosopher,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:43.860
writer. He said, “I don’t need a friend
who changes when I change, nods when I nod.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:52.099
My shadow does that much better!” Are you
going to be different? Will you provide counter-viewpoints?

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:57.639
Are you going to be my Devil’s Advocate?
Are you going to raise a finger? Stop me?

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:03.650
Come to me, only then! So, that’s a very
good lesson.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:14.910
Rule Number Four — Compare yourself to who
you were yesterday. Not to who someone else

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.720
is today! That is beyond ridiculous.. Because,
their backgrounds, their desires, their interests,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:29.540
their motivations, their specific challenges,
each is very different from each other. Far

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.849
more different than even the proverbial Apples
and Oranges. Comparing that, wasting time,

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:39.740
spending effort, don’t end up becoming a
good-for-nothing-nobody!

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:47.550
Do you remember this man? You may not. His
name is Joseph Heller. He wrote only that

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:56.750
book. He has of course written a few more,
but Joseph Heller is synonymous with Catch-22.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:10.879
At a party given by a billionaire on a private
island, a friend tells Joseph Heller, that

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:28.039
their host had made more money in a single
day than Heller had earned from his wildly

00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:36.580
popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history.
Heller responds,“Yes, but I have something

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:50.019
he will never have — ENOUGH.” Enough.
I am not interested in comparisons. I don’t

00:08:50.019 --> 00:09:04.370
have desires that are beyond my reach. I have
enough. And, HE doesn’t have THAT. So, stop

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.550
comparing.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:13.690
Rule Number Five — Do not let your children
do anything that makes you dislike them. We

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.579
can turn this one around too.. That would
be my preference. But, first, what is the

00:09:17.579 --> 00:09:22.510
context from which this author is posting
this thought? Well, if you don’t like it

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:28.870
as a parent, the society won’t like it either,
as a bystander! A notorious child! Correct!

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:36.700
But, I would like to flip it around and say,
“Do not do anything that makes your children

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:45.950
dislike you!” Guess why? Even if you speak
a thousand good words and kind phrases, your

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:52.329
behaviour.. the way you carry yourself, your
behaviour, your personality, it will speak

00:09:52.329 --> 00:10:00.500
volumes..! The same Ralph Waldo Emerson returns
with, “What you do speaks so loudly, that

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:18.580
I cannot hear what you say!” How beautiful!

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:26.339
Rule Number Six — Setting your house in
perfect order before you criticise the world!

00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:33.810
Are you worthy of being a critic?? This does
seem off key, because, if this were to be

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:40.490
the rule, well, nobody can criticise A R Rahman’s
music. Nobody can criticise a Surya Kumar

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:50.300
Yadav’s cricket batting.. Is that so? On
the other hand, this is perhaps what the author

00:10:50.300 --> 00:11:00.200
is trying to say. If you put in the effort
to clean things up inside you, probably your

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:07.889
outlook, your perspective, the vantage point
from which you observed and found that silly

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:16.089
thing, that problem, that imperfection, probably
that will vanish.. your viewpoint has changed..

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:26.220
because your expertise level has gone up.
And, so, Set your house in perfect order.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.080
Another reason? Seeing your house in perfect
order, one more may be inspired to do so.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:38.630
And, if each person does it to their frontyard,
.. drops the rubbish neatly in a personal

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:46.420
trashcan, the road will automatically become
clean, won’t it!? No need for a government

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.420
to clean it with some public works department!

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.649
Rule Number Seven — is about pursuing what
is meaningful, and not what is expedient..

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:59.000
not what is currently trending.. Particularly
the media rage about today’s trending hashtags..!

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.810
That is what John F Kennedy did.. He said,
nine years before he actually put man on the

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:16.120
Moon, he said, “We are not trying to put
man on the Moon because it is easy! We are

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.000
trying to do that specifically because we
know it is difficult. We know it is hard.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.060
And, that is why we are doing it! We are doing
it in spite of it”.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.330
Rule Number Eight — is about telling the
truth.. At least, not lying.. How does this

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:40.519
make sense? Tell the truth, or at least don’t
lie!! Okay, there is a huge gap between what

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:49.540
is the truth, and what is a lie. Remember
the court scene? I will tell you the truth,

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.000
nothing but the truth, and the whole truth..
You can’t hold anything back — you need

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.029
to tell it all. You can’t tell all the truth
and add a few sundry lies alongwith. That

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:07.660
won’t cut it either..! See, lies are dime
a dozen. And, each one of us can have one

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:15.501
version of it. But, there is only one version
of the truth. Sometimes, you don’t even

00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:21.899
need to tell the truth, because there is only
one version, the other person can deduce it

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:33.949
by themselves! And hence, tell the truth..
and, don’t wriggle yourself into a situation

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:40.220
where you need to lie your way out.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:50.589
Shakespeare made it very clear.. The liar..,
they are not cheating you. They are cheating

00:13:50.589 --> 00:13:57.220
themselves! If you don’t know any better,
you are not lying. You are lying only when,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:04.889
you know the truth, and you are choosing not
to tell it. That is why, Shakespeare says

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:08.279
thus, in Hamlet, “This above all — to
theine own self be true, and it must follow,

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:11.590
as night follows day, thou can not them be
false to any man.” To thine own self, be

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:18.899
true.. To your innermost self.. In the deepest
corner of your heart.. If you have something

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:22.730
hidden there that you are cognisant of, don’t
keep that from me, and spin a different story

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:32.020
to me. I am not going to hold you responsible
if you didn’t know what the truth was. Knowing

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.660
it, keeping it from me is the problem.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:42.060
Rule Number Nine — Assume that the person
you are listening to might know something

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:48.250
you don’t! It is a pretty famous quote,
a quote that laid the foundation for the Open

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:56.750
Source movement, they claim! “None of us
is as smart as all of us!” If we all get

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.610
together, nobody, .. remember those “Rest
of the World” teams? The World Champion

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.920
cricket team versus the Rest of the World
cricket team.. Typically, the rest of the

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:12.380
world wins, and why? The Rest of the World
is the best of the best, hand picked, all

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:19.760
brought together. So, respect.. Each of them
may have something that you can learn from.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.180
Approach every person with a learner’s mindset.
That is Rule Number Nine.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.269
Rule Number Ten — is about Being Precise
in your Speech. And, he gives the example

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:38.279
of paint brushes. There is a paint brush like
this one. It is so precise and narrow that

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:43.890
it can help you paint a single eye-lash on
Mona Lisa’s eye. There is a brush like this

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:51.829
one too. A broadstroked roller that is used
to paint walls. So, when getting into an argument

00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:58.019
for example, probably with your wife, probably
with your friend, you are getting into an

00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:00.350
argument.. stooping low with comments like,
“You are always like this”, or “I remember

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:09.860
what you did last summer”, and so on.. those
are broadstrokes. Come to the point. Refer

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:20.079
to that only. And, be concise in your speech.
That is a very good rule for life.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:25.770
Rule Number Eleven is about not bothering
children when they are skateboarding. He will

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.060
start with a wonderfully gripping story! Very
interesting! And, you would wonder, where

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.270
is the author going to take us? The rule itself
is pretty funny to hear! But, he gives us

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:42.569
a very good lesson because, if you look at
skateboarding injuries.. you will notice that

00:16:42.569 --> 00:16:53.060
it is pretty messy. And, if a child is risking
that injury.. wearing helmet, protective gear,

00:16:53.060 --> 00:17:03.140
.. if it is risking injury, in a safe environment,
probably being observed by some coaches, or

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:09.959
by other fellow players.., the child is getting
ready for the game of life. He is going to

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:16.449
get bruised and beaten up in the real world.
Helicopter parenting won’t help. Micromanagement

00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:23.990
won’t do. So, if a child is learning to
skateboard, it means the child is going out

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:33.250
of their circle of comfort. Cautiously exploring,
judging an injury, learning to take care,

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:41.520
and understanding how to bounce back. So important.
You can’t teach them through any college

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.520
course, how to face those challenges of life.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:53.840
And, finally, Rule Number Twelve, Pet a cat
when you encounter one on the street. You

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.919
decide whether it is a cat or dog that suits
you, but in our city, it is a cat, says the

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:08.270
author, and continues by bringing around the
beautiful meditative lesson, “Stop to smell

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:17.750
the roses”. Most of our time is spent worrying,
and being concerned, and planning for what

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:27.130
the future is going to be.. Or, regretting,
or being nostalgic, being wistful of what

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:32.440
has gone by.. Very few, very rarely, enjoy
the moment for what it is. If you encounter

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.810
a double rainbow in front of you in the horizon,
you grope around for your smartphone first.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.400
And, before he changes the settings and gets
ready for the all-important photograph, that

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:51.120
rainbow is gone. Learn to enjoy that moment
— is the Twelfth Rule. Pet a cat when you

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:58.970
encounter one on the street. So, twelve beautiful
rules for life, and I am hoping we will jump

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:05.710
back into these.. Later this month, we have
a flurry of Quotidians coming up, and probably

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.429
we will dive into these in more detail.

00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:16.929
As a closing thought, I want to share those
visuals.. Twelve very beautiful pen drawings..

00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:23.960
Those pen-drawings start each chapter in the
book. And, the author says he engaged with

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:31.520
a friend.. a favourite artist.. And, the artist..
you may want to go back in the video and look

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.929
at them again, or you may probably want to
buy the book and flip through the pages..

00:19:37.929 --> 00:19:49.400
That artist placed the author’s children,
two kids, one boy, one girl, .. in each of

00:19:49.400 --> 00:20:02.480
the chapter-images. Very tastefully done!
Take a look! We will meet you soon. Namaste!
