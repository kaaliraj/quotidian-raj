00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:18.010
Namaste!

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.650
Starting with why!

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.590
About ninety-two days ago, in Quotidian-108,
while referring to the philosophy of Short

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.740
and Sweet, I spoke thus!

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.350
Simon Sinek shot to fame when he wrote this
amazing book titled “Start With Why”.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.350
It refers to a concept called The Golden Circle.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.960
We will surely dig deeper into this in a forthcoming
Quotidian.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:55.440
And, ninety-two days have gone by, and I never
got back to talking about that book and that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.440
concept.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.340
Something supposedly referred to as The Golden
Circle.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.379
So, I thought I should close out that pending
issue.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.240
The Golden Circle is, in fact, a pretty simple
concept.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.939
But, a profound and very impactful concept.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:26.619
He said, be it a company, or a specific individual,
their outwardly behaviour, their outwardly

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.469
demonstration, what they can create, what
they have created, what they get to eventually

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.930
show, that level is the WHAT level.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.439
What are you?

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.169
What do you produce?

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:40.209
What is this product?

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.700
Superficial…

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.289
Surface level.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.509
You shouldn’t focus just on that, if you
are an entrepreneur, if you are striking out

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.779
on making a mark in this world…

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.729
Not even with the How!

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.719
How do you do what you do?!

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.859
Even that is not enough.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:00.859
You have to go deeper inside.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.159
And go to the core of your being.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.719
The reason for your existence.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.969
You are a living human being?

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.860
Well, why are you still alive?!

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.310
What is the reason for your existence?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.380
Are you a company?

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.450
Why were you founded?

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.280
Why do you even exist?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.660
Answers to that question!

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.700
If you stand in front of that mirror, ask
that question repeatedly, search for the answer,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.189
then, magically, the How and What will fall
in place automatically!

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.819
That is the message of that book.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.170
So, if you look at it, what you do is at the
surface.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.069
How do you do what you do??

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.620
What is the process?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.670
What is your belief system?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.209
What are your values?

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.719
What kind of people do you attract to get
the job done?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.099
What are the places you have established your
company in?

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.780
That is the How!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.489
But, deep inside is, Why do you do what you
do.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.469
What is the overall purpose.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.209
Why do you even exist.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.950
This, by the way, is his life’s mission.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.739
If you ask Simon Sinek what his Why is, he
would proudly say, “To ensure ever human

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:34.150
being on this earth lives a happy and satisfied
life because they have found their Why”.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.409
This is the overarching theme in that book.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.810
He says, People don’t buy what you do.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.049
They buy why you do it.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.870
They buy it because they understand and relate
to why you are building that product.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.950
There is a cute little advantage too, in focusing
on the Why.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.439
Just a few days ago, we talked about Jumping
The Curve.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.810
When you jump the curve, the product may change.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.409
When you jump the curve, the process, and
the How, might change.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:22.860
You will have to try your best and retain
the Why, though, when you jump the curve.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.740
Take a look at these examples:- Our mission:-
To bring inspiration and innovation to every

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.110
athlete in the world!

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.830
(Who is an athlete?

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.990
— If you have a body, you are an athlete,
they clarify!)

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.650
What a wide-ranging all-catching mission statement!

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.650
Who?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.650
Nike!

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:52.910
If they had gone with “We Sell Shoes”,
would they have been able to sell fitness

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.910
bands?

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.910
T Shirts?

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.669
Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation,
they said, and immediately, everything fell

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.419
inside that basket!

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.349
Our mission is to organise the world’s information
resources so that they become widely available

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.240
and useful for everyone — claims this company.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.240
Yes, Google!

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.120
They didn’t proclaim that their intent is
to become the world’s greatest search engine!

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.120
Did they?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:24.569
If they had done that, would there have been
a way out for them to launch Maps, Chat, Mail,

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.250
and so on?

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.610
Could they have entered those markets?

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.910
“It’s our goal to be Earth’s most customer-centric
company, where customers can find and discover

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.710
anything they might want to buy online”
— Again a wide-ranging all-catching statement.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.640
Who are these guys?

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.640
Amazon!

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.479
Did he say he wanted to just sell books??

00:05:49.479 --> 00:06:00.270
Had he done that, would Jeff Bezos be able
to sell an Amazon Echo and Amazon Web Services??

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.860
“Give people the power to share and make
the world more open and connected” — claims

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.860
this company.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.980
Note that it is not saying, “Be a social
network where anybody can befriend anybody

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.980
else”.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.009
Nor “Play Candy Crush and Farmville”.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.740
But, all of those, fall into this bucket!

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.470
Because, this is their mission statement.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.229
The Why.

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.229
Why do you exist?

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.970
Well, I want to make it easier for people
to connect with people.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.120
Could be on a mobile phone.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.819
Could be in a web browser.

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.900
Could be in real life.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.750
That is Facebook!

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.449
Now, take a look at this!

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.610
Once upon a time there was a dash.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.729
Every day, dash happened.

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.050
One day, dash happened.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.009
Because of that, dash.

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.380
Because of that, dash.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.259
Until finally, dash!

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.080
This is the structure of almost any story!

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.340
And, this is the core that this company wants
to own!

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.340
Disney!

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.270
And Disney says, today, that it is in the
business of telling stories!

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.050
On a TV Channel?

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.879
In the movie theatres?

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:18.259
At an amusement park?

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:19.259
We.

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:20.259
Tell.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.259
Stories.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:22.870
Who doesn’t like listening to stories?!

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.889
And, that is the catch-all.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.680
That is their Why.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.040
Why was Disney even founded?

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.220
Mr. Walt Disney wanted to regale his nieces
and nephews with stories.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.220
Amazing stories!

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.220
How about this?

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.220
Think Different!

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.220
No questions!

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.220
It has to be Apple!

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:46.840
We don’t want to do what everybody else
is doing.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.000
We want to do what nobody else is doing.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Simple!

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.060
No wonder it is such a world-class company
that is coming up with amazingly innovative

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.870
products.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.180
Starting with why.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:10.830
The other advantage is, copying is harder
when you have a very strong why.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.270
When you make every decision, when you make
every move, when every one of your What and

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.699
How align with your Why, copying is harder.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:32.250
If it is your What that you claim to be unique
and best, well, they can just walk into your

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.790
shop, survey it, learn about it, and make
a copy-cat product.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:52.470
If it is your How that you claim to be special,
we can send a spy to your factory, to your

00:08:52.470 --> 00:09:00.300
manufacturing zone, and probably make a copy
of your product.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:09.400
But, if you Start With Why, if your foundational
thoughts are about your Why, they have to

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.380
dig into your mind!

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.470
They have to come deep inside!

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:21.180
That is because, every one of your decisions
may seem silly, illogical, different, even

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.520
foolish, to them.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:29.750
But, when you look inside, every one of your
moves, every next thing you launch, every

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:36.790
new process you adopt, will be aligned with
your internal Why.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:43.570
You as a person, you as a founding team, will
have that thing lined up.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.510
So, start with why!

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.880
And that’s the most important thing you
should do.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:57.080
Further, in that book “Start With Why”,
the author lays out three amazing and pithy

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080
principles.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.320
Clarity of Why.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:09.970
Instead of being all over the place, nebulous
and unclear, the Why should be as simple as

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.780
it is clear.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:17.820
Next, there has to be a Discipline in the
How.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.100
Decide what the process is going to be.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:30.530
Without slipping away, without swerving from
it ever, without bending, breaking, no questions

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.800
asked, with excellent discipline, one has
to adhere to the How.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.490
If there is Clarity of Why and Discipline
of How, but if your What is a bit inconsistent,

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.600
that is not good either.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.240
So, the final product, the thing that you
give out to the world?

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.030
That has to be consistent.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:11:04.270
So, Clarity of Why, with a Disciplined approach
of How, ending in a beautiful Consistency

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.570
of What.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.770
That’s what he says!

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.790
Even in my Quotidians, for example, What do
I do?

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.150
Well, I make videos on Youtube.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.020
But, is that my Why?

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.770
To make videos on YouTube?

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.770
No!

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.770
How do I do it?

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.770
I have a green screen?

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.800
I have some software.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.040
I put some research into it.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.250
Is that my Why?

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.720
What is my Why?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:38.800
My Why is to collect amazing bits of information
from around the world, and make it useful,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.990
make it palatable, make it understandable
to Tamil youth of the world.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:54.710
Oh, well, there is a little secret personal
selfish Why also, to this.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.210
In the process of teaching you stuff, I am
learning too!

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.210
Every day!

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.850
That is my Why!

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:10.190
So, if suddenly, one day, I switch to live
video, or if I start writing a blog, if I

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:20.690
suddenly publish a book, they will all fall
under the reaching-out that I just stated.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:26.190
That is the speciality of starting with a
Why.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.260
But…

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.570
I have a question to ask about this.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.940
Is Starting With Why right?

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.750
Is Starting With Why enough?

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.880
Let us check that out tomorrow!

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.600
Thank you!
