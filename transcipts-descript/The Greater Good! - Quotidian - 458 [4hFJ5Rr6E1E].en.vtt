00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.520
Do you remember this scene?

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.620
You may have traveled half-way across the
globe.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.500
Fourteen hour flight.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.440
The flight might have been delayed along the
way.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.440
TWO HOURS.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.039
You would have been a paragon of patience.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.289
In peace, patiently, calmly, you would have
waited it all out.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.350
Tolerated it all.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.950
But, in that fifteen-second gap between the
aeroplane coming to a halt and the attendant

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.470
announcing that you may now take your baggage
out, those FIFTEEN SECONDS, you are not able

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.820
to wait..!

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.020
And, one guy, or one lady, starts it..

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.130
It becomes such a mess..

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.690
Everybody is actually delayed further because
of that mess..

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.719
But still..

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.870
That one person kicks it off.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.300
One bad soul.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.700
I have something to tell you about this.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:20.759
Let’s go.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.780
Namaste!

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.310
In Four Fifty Eight, we are going to look
at The Greater Good of the Greater Number.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.130
Even if it is a hindrance to some, if it means
the greater good for the greater number, how

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.440
do we make it happen..?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.400
And how to ensure they don’t suffer because
of those one or two idiots?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.020
Let us get started.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.840
In Quotidian 146, we talked about something
called the Broken Window Theory.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.409
“There is a theory called the Broken Window
Theory.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.060
And, this is what it says.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.349
In a community, in an environment, in a neighbourhood,
everything is fine, even if the police isn’t

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:26.970
watching, everything is fine.. until there
is the first window that is broken by accident

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.420
perhaps and left unattended.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.569
One window sill, broken at just one place,
ignored by the owners and the powers that

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.840
be.., the neighbourhood becomes labeled as
one that nobody cares for, and soon, somebody

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.739
is breaking the car window downstairs, somebody
else starts spraying graffiti obsceneties

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.420
in the wall around the corner, a bystander
starts littering, and grand larceny is just

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.710
a short time away.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.610
All because of a broken mirror left unattended.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.739
If a glasspane is attended to immediately
after it is broken, the neighbourhood is safe.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.530
Or, so the theory goes.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.690
Some have started questioning this.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.129
But, there is this research that was done,
and people said that there was this Broken

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.830
Window Theory.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.810
The first window that’s left unattended..”

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.390
That’s the Broken Window Theory.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.930
There has to be somebody to oversee things
all the time.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.849
Or at least, you should create the impression
that there is somebody up there, watching

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:50.510
and ensuring that there is no spiralling out,
uncontrollable growth of the inherent evil

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.050
nature in our minds.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:01.180
When I use the phrase “inherent evil nature”,
I am reminded of this book.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.060
Lord of the Flies — it was called.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:18.169
A plane carrying boys crashlands in an island,
and the boys are left without adult supervision.

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.640
They form clans.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.550
There is a democracy on the one side, there
is a dictatorship on the other.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:39.009
How they get into fights, how there is a chase,
a hunt, a murder, … things just become uncontrollable

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:46.620
after a point of time, simply because they
lack adult supervision, and simply because,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.699
any group of people, left without a structure,
they are bound to deteriorate.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.780
Their evil, base nature will come out.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.850
Their good nature won’t be expressed, alas.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.290
Their crass, selfish alterego will take charge.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:13.970
This will be so beautifully depicted in this
book.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.270
I have referred to this lady quite a number
of times.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.660
Kathy Sierra is her name.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:29.199
She has authored amazing books, delivered
wonderful talks, all of which, they were based

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:38.039
on the research, the writing, the interacting
with customers and visitors that she had done

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.009
for probably more than a decade, on her blog.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:49.229
In the blog titled, “Creating Passionate
Users”, all along till 2007, she was maintaining

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:56.050
a very good standard of frequency and customer
interaction.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:03.820
One day, in 2007, things went out of hand..

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:17.759
An anonymous post was made, criticising her,
threatening her, all the way to sexual abuse,

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.069
and a threat of death.

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.639
Something just snapped inside her.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.700
Kathy Sierra said, “Enough is enough..

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.700
I am afraid..

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.250
I can’t make public appearances any more.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.030
I can’t deliver lectures any more.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.640
I am not able to post any blogs any longer.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.620
I am going OFF the internet.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.720
One person..

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.280
They haven’t found out YET, who the person
was.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280
After all these years.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.280
We don’t know who did that.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.530
But, the prank played by just one person…

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.240
I am just looking back and wondering..

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.639
How much more could she have done?

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.039
How much more could she have shared?

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.560
How many more amazing insights she might have
given us..?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.160
That is the feeling I have.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:13.099
So, that one evil person should not hold the
rest of the good ones, both willing to give

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:21.819
as well as wanting to take, they can’t hold
those people at ransom.

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.850
Something should be done.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.699
Some sort of policing.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.360
Some sort of loose structure.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.460
A framework.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.770
For punishment.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.770
A movie.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.680
Titled Prison Break.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.009
It is a series.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.520
You can watch it even today, on Hotstar.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.050
In Season Three of this amazing TV series,
That guy wearing the orange dress is the villain.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.520
This other person is the hero.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.910
But, that villain, his name is Lechero..

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:09.410
He threatens our hero, and says, “I am not
worried about driving a knife into you, okay?

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.400
I don’t mind killing you..

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.060
What can this policeman do?

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.940
I am already in here for life.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.490
I have six LIFE sentences.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.639
Not in parallel.

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:23.699
In SEQUENCE.

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:27.389
Six imprisonments for life.

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:33.450
Which means I am here for life.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.729
What can they do?

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:38.550
What further punishment can they pile on top
of me?”

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.550
You see that?

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.630
When some situation is without redemption..

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:51.460
You remember that story about the little dragon
that slowly started growing?

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.850
We saw the problem if we don’t acknowledge
something what happens.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:04.320
In the same way, when this person is told
“You can’t get out..” he is also being

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:12.620
told “You can do anything else also if you
want, because, anyway, however good you transform

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.360
yourself into, you are not getting out!”

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.480
Wrong, is it not?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.040
So, there has to be a midway policy..

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.800
You can’t banish the person.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.050
But, you should punish the person too.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.670
What do we do?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.089
Take this story as an example.

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:33.900
This happened LAST NIGHT, in the airplane.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.240
I was waiting to get off the plane.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.290
I am being the good soul here, obedient and
rule-bound.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.279
Everybody else starts getting up, even before
the attendant has said, “You may now get

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.579
up and take your baggage out”.

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:51.140
Guess what that lady did?

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.829
She said, “I have all the time in the world!”

00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:58.660
(I am already chafing here — “I don’t!”)

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:06.370
We are NOT allowing you to exit the airplane
until all of you sit back in your chairs.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.980
All of you sit back down.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.450
And then, I will turn the seat-belt-removal
sign on.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.760
And then, one by one, you can offplane.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:28.131
Basically, she delayed me (Mr. Nice Guy!)
for fifteen extra minutes, because, I was

00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:34.060
obeying the rules but somebody else, some
other idiot did not!

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.990
Is this fair?

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:43.060
Is it fair to delay somebody because somebody
else was misbehaving?

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.970
In Mumbai, they tried this out.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.639
They called it the Punishing Signal.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:56.370
If you honk unnecessarily at a signal, they
set up decibel meters and they wired it up

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.019
to the signal.

00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:12.880
If the noise level crossed a particular threshold
level, the noise made by the impatient twowheeler

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:20.070
riders and car drivers.., if it did, the signal
that should have turned green by then, would

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.130
remain RED.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.160
Everybody had to cool down.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:30.870
I hadn’t honked at all — but, I was being
punished alongside all those others, those

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:37.150
silly people, who didn’t realise what was
happening, who didn’t care about what was

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.150
happening..

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:44.300
pranksters, trolls, .. BECAUSE OF THEM, I
suffered..

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.980
One trouble-maker, everybody else is made
to wait..!

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.980
Is that fair?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:55.050
We are using this book as part of our curriculum
at Zoho Schools.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:00.980
A couple of days ago, we encountered a chapter
where he talks about this specific scenario.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:07.810
If you create or are part of any community
at all, that community will always have one

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.810
or two trouble-makers.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:17.831
As a software engineer.., if you are a policeman,
if a car violates a rule in your presence,

00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:22.910
you are in the physical world, you are forced
to follow some laws of physics..

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:29.680
But, in the digital world, if you are a software
engineer, if you were creating a platform

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:37.260
where people could come and collaborate online,
as a community.. in that digital community,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:44.320
there are three beautiful ways you can handle
the pranksters and trolls.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.990
It is not fair to make EVERYBODY wait just
because one person crossed the line.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.130
That traffic signal..

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.570
It is just a person, why not we turn a blind
eye towards them…that attitude is dangerous

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:55.570
too..

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.120
Remember what happened to Kathy Sierra.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.380
And, there is one more thing that people do,
that backfires.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.389
Which is, Public Shaming.

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:06.490
They called it the Dunce cap.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.180
Once upon a time, there was this person named
Mr. Duns, a genius thinker.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:16.600
And, the Duns cap, a pointy headdress once
symbolised knowledge and wisdom and genius.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.010
But, now things have changed.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.010
Five hundred..

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.010
six hundred years later..

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.200
The dunce cap — classic schoolroom scenario..

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200
this one.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.199
A boy has committed a mistake.

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:34.959
And, in front of the whole classroom, the
boy is placed on a high chair like this, wearing

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:37.839
a cap like that, facing away towards the wall.

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:41.850
Until the class ends.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.960
What feeling is this child going to leave
the classroom with?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.940
Will the child ever love the teacher?

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.740
Or the other kids who laughed in class?

00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:01.060
What motivation remains in the child to come
back and be a better child?

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.000
Perform better?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.920
You’ve drained it.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.720
That book tells us about three key words.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.139
One is called “Hellbanning”.

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:20.360
It is about creating a special place in your
software, the “Hell”, and banishing such

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.230
trouble-makers to that world.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:32.759
And, when you hellban somebody, they don’t
know that they have been banned..

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:36.040
What is meant by “banning”?

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.620
You type something inappropriate or obscene…

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.810
And the system wakes up, and reacts with,
“Sorry, you cannot try another comment for

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.500
the next 24 hours”.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.770
The moment you see this, what do you do?

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:48.770
Wait 24 hours?

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.100
Or, angrily create another account to go on
with your rant?

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.370
You bang the keyboard.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.490
You pubicly shame that website probably.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.940
You will try all these sorts of things to
“get back at them”.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.630
But, if you have been hellbanned, you don’t
even know you’ve been banned!

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:06.870
The comments you type away will seem like
they have been accepted.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.720
TO YOU, they will show up just fine.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.810
But, others?

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.069
They won’t even know you exist!

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:19.190
That you made a comment, an obscene remark,
they wouldn’t know.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.910
A cool off period later, you are welcome back.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:23.910
Your comments appear.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.050
That’s the way it works.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.930
Hellbanning protects you from yourself..

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:36.240
And, of course, protects everybody else from
you!

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.560
There is another slight twist to the hellban…!

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.560
When you enter the Hell, you see ONLY the
others who have been hellbanned..

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560
“Fight among yourselves.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560
Go at it.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.480
Each of you deserve the other, after all!”

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.080
The second interesting keyword I learned?

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.200
It is “Slowbanning”.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.860
Do you remember this scene from Mr. Bean?

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:22.579
That is slowbanning..

00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:37.399
We artificially introduce a sense of slowness.

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:43.660
Every little thing you try, you are going
to be forced to do it in slow motion.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:50.390
You want to press a key, type a word, it starts
appearing glacially slowly on screen.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:56.610
Or, you submit a simple form, it takes ten
minutes to get submitted and gets loaded.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:02.720
You want to load a page, images don’t load
at all, or take a long long while to load.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.929
As a programmer, they can do that to you.

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:11.939
They can identify that you are the troublemaker,
you are the troll, and put you on the slowbanning

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:12.939
path.

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:20.470
Whatever you ask for, whatever you request
to the server, they can relegate you to the

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.240
Slow Queue!

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.309
Everything will look like how it looked to
Mr. Bean today!

00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:28.840
That is slowbanning.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.070
And then, there is the third word that I learned.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.580
Called “Errorbanning”.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.721
Errorbanning is just randomly introducing
errors..

00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:43.250
A website is running all quite fine, and you
ask for a page and it loads a blank page.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.250
Or, say, “Sorry, record not found, try again..”

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:50.570
You type out the correct username and password,
and it says, “Username not found, try again”.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:56.570
Fourth attempt — same username password
combo lets you in.. but, when you are errorbanned,

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:01.260
you will be surrounded by messages like these.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.289
You will be confused..

00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:09.130
This would have been a road you drove through,
every day, but today, you are met with signs

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.200
like these!

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.130
What will you do!?

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.419
What will you do?!

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:17.530
That, is errorbanning.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:23.370
The idea then, is to discourage you from being
yourself.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.929
Trying to introduce additional layers of discomfort..

00:18:26.929 --> 00:18:39.450
To remind you that there is an extremely powerful
being out there, that is just waking up, careful..

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.120
Hellbanning.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.780
Slowbanning.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.450
Errorbanning.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.539
The closing thought is a thought I got myself..

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:54.559
when I learned these three words.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:58.760
Just like you, I have also seen slow loading
pages.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:07.669
I have also encountered scenarios where everything
should have worked, but it just randomly crashed

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:10.670
on me and threw an error..

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.790
I wondered..

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:25.659
Is that a coincidence, or was I actually flirting
with that dangerous slow-ban, error-ban, algorithm?

00:19:25.659 --> 00:19:28.850
Was I risking it?

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.320
It is a question you need to ask yourselves
too.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:42.030
When the internet seems slow, it could instead
be that just that page of just that website,

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:48.900
just for you, has been made consciously slower.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.330
Become a good person!

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.860
All the best!

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:02.440
We will meet again soon!

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.889
Thank you!
