00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.830
There was a book like this, called “The
48 Laws of Power” by Robert Greene.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.980
And, we all know, the classic Valmiki Ramayana!

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.920
Is there a connection between these two?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.449
Can we learn a lesson from cross-referencing
these two books?

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:46.629
That is exactly what our attempt is, this
time, let’s get going!

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.140
Namaste!

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.059
Powers of Rama — is the title I have given
this Quotidian.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.719
For, we are going to draw the laws from this
book, but we are going to compare them with

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.860
the story of Maryadha Purush Shri Rama!

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.560
I have liberally extracted tidbits and side-stories
from the Ramayanas that I have known, it might

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.320
be that you have a different opinion, a different
explanation for what happens, forgive me!

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.720
But, this book, 48 Laws of Power, is just
a sequence of 48 Laws.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.900
And, each Law is laid out as a single statement,
followed by the judgement, followed by some

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.470
observations, followed by some examples, followed
by some counter-examples, followed by a beautiful

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.750
final note called The Reversal.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.300
Mistakes committed by ancient kings like Alexander
The Great, all the way to bunglings of modern

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.680
day presidents and prime ministers like Queen
Elizabeth and Jawaharlal Nehru… this book

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.340
covers them all.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.960
What we are going to do is go a little earlier.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.810
To a book written about 2500 years ago!

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.810
The Ramayana!

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.519
Is there a reference to such Laws of Power!?

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.209
Let us see!

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.510
Law Number 1:- Never outshine the master!

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.980
Immediately flashing on to my mind is the
scene where Hanuman gets a bit over-enthusiastic

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.329
after seeing Sita in Asoka Vana.

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.099
Why don’t you let me take you to Rama all
by myself?

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.969
I can lift all of Lanka on to my palm!

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:42.189
I can lift the marketing streets, lift the
forts, the arches, all of them!

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.629
Come along!

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.079
— He asks.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.160
To which, Sita responds, quite respectfully,
but still with a snub.. in the story of The

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160
Ramayana.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.450
So, never outshine the master.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.360
You derive your power from your loyalty to
Ram.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.650
Don’t forget that! — is the beautiful
observation there.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.139
Law Number 2:- Never put too much trust in
friends, learn how to use enemies!

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.810
Instantly we are reminded of Vibhishana.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.340
Ravana’s younger brother!

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.280
And, this brother has told Ravana that he
is no longer going to support him, and he

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.520
comes over to Rama with complete surrender.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.510
And Rama says, “I take you for who you are,
I don’t care if you have other intentions

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.579
to somehow become the next King of Lanka,
come, I will trust you… and, tell me more

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.030
about the strengths and weaknesses of the
Rakshasas”… thus immediately getting into

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.319
a strategic fact-finding mission about enemy’s
power!

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.469
Law Number 3:- Conceal your intentions.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:59.069
What are you thinking, what do you want to
do, hide it from plain view.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.970
Wasn’t that what Kaikeyi did?

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.010
Give me three boons, she had asked Dasaratha.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.909
She says, “There is something I desire my
Lord, If you promise to grand my wish, I shall

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.249
tell you what they are!”

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:12.569
How fair is that??

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.570
But, the whole starting point for The Ramayana,
the turning point so to speak, was Dasaratha,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.930
because of the love he had for Kaikeyi, says,
“Ask me whatever you want!

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.250
Consider them granted!”

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.990
So, be careful when people conceal their intentions.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.360
Law Number 5:- So much depends on reputation,
guard it with your life!

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.940
But, that’s what Rama did!

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.140
Some promise Dad has given Mom… why does
that matter to me after all, could have been

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.140
his stance!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.190
But what Rama did, “I respect my Dad.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.380
His word has to be preserved.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.570
And, if, for that, I have to go fourteen years
into the jungle, so be it!

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.690
That is how it is ordained, and that is how
I will follow it!

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.170
My Dad’s word is my word!”

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:14.080
That is why, Rama’s word, the act of giving
a word and following it, is embedded so indelibly

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.680
in our minds.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.010
Law Number 6:- Court attention at all cost!

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.690
A bit selfish, this one sounds.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.690
Most of the laws in this book sound like that,
by the way.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.490
They will sound like “It doesn’t matter
if everybody else suffers, all that matters

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.570
is me winning it!”

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.570
But, that’s okay!

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.940
We will deal with that later!

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.990
Courting attention at all cost…

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.130
Have you seen the colour of Rama’s skin?

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.910
They call the colour various names.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.450
“Shyaama”, “Megha Shyaama”, “Krushna”,
“Neela”… varnams.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.520
He is actually black in colour.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.840
Krushna actually means Black in Sanskrit.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.920
But, our folks have something against “dark
colour” and so they call it “blue skin”,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:06.210
and anybody who acts as Rama in dramas and
movies ends up getting a deep blue paint all

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.720
over their body!

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.800
He stood out!

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.140
From everybody else, he stood out, didn’t
he!

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.140
So, we can even say, he courted attention!

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:28.400
Law Number 7:- Get others to do the work for
you, but always take the credit!

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.670
But, isn’t that what happened in The Ramayana,
when they had to build a ocean-spanning bridge

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.670
of rocks and stones?

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.550
Did Rama lift and place even one stone?

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.550
No!

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.370
Those small and large monkeys, the squirrels,
the bears, those are the ones that did the

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.370
“heavy lifting”!

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.290
But the bridge is called “Ramar Sethu”,
the place is called “Rameshwaram”…

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.750
Yes, it does sound a little bit immoral…
he took the credit!

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.990
Law Number 8:- Make other people come to you,
use bait if necessary!

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.130
Once, during the Vaali-Sugreeva duel, Sugreeva
returns beaten nearly to death.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:14.430
But, Rama apologises that they both look alike,
he couldn’t make out who was who…

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.150
And then, the next time, Rama says, “Vaali
will come quite boldly this time because of

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.650
the thumping he gave you the last time, (in
other words, bait!), but, on the way, take

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:31.720
these flowers, wear this garland of white
flowers, and thus I will know which one of

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.970
the two is you, and I will be able to send
my arrow towards Vaali.”

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.500
That is the interesting twist.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.450
He made other people come to him.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.730
He used bait!

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.190
Law Number 9:- Win through your actions, never
through argument!

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.050
With some people, you simply can’t make
any progress with just words!

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.570
You just may have to get down to blows!

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:01.930
So, you are a monkey.. you follow completely
different rules.. and if I have to reason

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.690
out with you, “Hey, you have usurped his
wife, and that’s not morally right, please

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.460
return her”, you are not going to listen
to me!

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.370
This is the only way this can be handled.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.550
And that is how Vaali is “assassinated”.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.730
From a hiding vantage point, in fact.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.210
And, so sometimes, he wins through actions.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:26.220
And he doesn’t reason out “King to King”,
and he reasons out “Man to Animal”, get

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.220
it?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.700
Law Number 10:- Infection..

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.050
Avoid the unhappy and unlucky!

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.089
says Robert Greene.

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:40.110
There aren’t too many stories that highlight
this in The Ramayana, but they have this term

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:45.740
“shakun”… where the universe conspires
to send you a message, to wake you up, to

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:51.660
stop what you are doing, to correct your action…
that happens quite often in The Ramayana.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:09:00.520
One classic moment is when Ravana is preparing
for war against Rama and the fire in the Yagna

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.290
pit releases “smoke”… and that is considered
inauspicious, a bad omen.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.860
It should be pure and a blazing white fire.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.689
Something is wrong somewhere, it says.

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:12.029
Bad smell starts emanating.

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:14.790
Crows start congregating atop their buildings.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.820
This is pointed out by Vibheeshanan.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.850
These are all unlucky and bad omens.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.750
Let us take a message from those, he says.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.529
But, Ravana doesn’t listen.

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:28.829
And we know what happened.

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:32.110
Law Number 11:- Learn to keep people dependent
on you!

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.569
Make them want you over everybody else!

00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:37.660
Don’t let them think it is you, and if not
you somebody else.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.660
No biggie!

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:45.079
That is what happens when Rama doesn’t go
alone to the jungle.

00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:47.290
Wife says “I will come with you.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.670
Wherever you are, that’s Ayodhya for me!”

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.699
Brother says, “I will leave my wife, and
I will come with you.

00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:54.699
I will stay with you.

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:55.810
I will protect you.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.810
I need you!”

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.850
Another brother comes!

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:58.850
Bharath!

00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.850
After a long time.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.340
Searching for Rama in the jungle.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.370
“If you are not going to be around, I don’t
need the kingdom either.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.759
I will stay outside.

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:10.390
I will pray for you.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.390
For your return.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.699
I will wait.”

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:15.800
Somehow he makes himself inexpendable.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.519
And that’s one of the powers!

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:26.480
Law Number 12:- Use selective honesty and
generosity to disarm your victim!

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.420
Basically what this means is cheating is allowed.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.730
And that is what Ravana does…

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.170
In Asoka Vana, he uses black magic, brings
Rama’s head on a platter to Sita.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:48.389
And he event tries reasoning with Sita — let
me just do away with Rama, I will forgive

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:50.689
everybody else, just be my wife…

00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:55.949
I will spare everybody else, he tries saying.

00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:58.769
Selective honesty and false generosity.

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:05.600
Law Number 13:- When asking for help, appeal
to people’s self-interest, never to their

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.839
mercy or gratitude!

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:12.740
There is Sugreeva this side, there is Rama
on the other side, Rama doesn’t say “My

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.519
wife is missing, I need help”.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:17.160
Rama instead says, “Looks like your wife
is missing.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.720
I don’t see her with you now.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720
What happened?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.249
Where is your brother?

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:24.259
Show him to me!

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:27.300
Let me deal with him!

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.709
And, probably win your friendship and eventually
get help for searching for my wife…!”

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:34.769
Isn’t that beautiful!

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:38.650
Law Number 14:- Pose as a friend, work as
a spy!

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.819
Probably the only spy we all know in all of
Ramayana is Kooni, Manthara…

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:46.290
She has had some good aspects to her character
too…

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.730
She comes from the Kingdom of Kekaya.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.460
She comes as Kaikeyi’s maid.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:57.149
She was originally a princess at the same
level in the hierarchy as Kaikeyi.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:04.699
But, due to some problem when she was young,
she gets deformed in her body, and she becomes

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:07.300
treated as Kaikeyi’s maid.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.740
Perhaps because of that pent up anger, or
perhaps not, she exacts revenge.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.143
And that is why Ramayana actually unfolds
into the epic that it became!

00:12:15.143 --> 00:12:16.143
We know that!

00:12:16.143 --> 00:12:19.810
Law Number 15:- Crush your enemy totally!

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.189
That’s what Rama tries doing!

00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:25.199
He severs Ravana’s head, but a new one keeps
sprouting!

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:27.920
Rama shoots arrow after arrow but Ravana seems
to have an inexhaustible supply of heads!

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.970
“Oh my God!”, he exclaims, “This seems
to be a completely different beast altogether!”

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:39.639
and that’s when he realises his life is
probably in the Amritha Kalash hidden somewhere

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:43.350
in Ravana’s abdomen, and unleashes the Brahmasthra
towards it!

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.970
Law Number 16:- Use absence to increase respect
and honour!

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.879
Immediately, I am reminded of Bharatha, taking
Rama’s Paadhuka.

00:12:52.879 --> 00:13:02.010
Taking his footwear, placing it on the grand
throne, making it rule in proxy!

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.569
“In his honour, I will wait just outside.

00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:06.569
You come.

00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:11.200
And, if you don’t come within one day of
the fourteenth year passing, I will jump into

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.639
the fire” he says!

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:14.639
Beautiful!

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:18.899
Law Number 17:- Keep others in suspended terror.

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.869
Cultivate an air of unpredictability!

00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:24.720
That is what Ravana does!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.379
During the final clash, Ravana is fighting
hard with Rama..

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:36.170
And Ravana’s charioteer suddenly whisks
him away from the battlefield!

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.170
Outside!

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.000
Far and away!

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.120
Ravana is livid!

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.920
“How dare you remove my chariot from the
battlefield, making me look like a coward!”

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920
he shouts..

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.499
And the charioteer responds, respectfully,
“I did not act out of fear, negligence,

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.569
or disloyalty..

00:13:53.569 --> 00:14:03.290
I saw your exhaustion, I wanted to give you
some time to rest, and some rest for the horses

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.290
too.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.980
Now let’s go back!” he says!

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.079
Immediately Ravana’s heart melts…

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:10.079
(Imagine!

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.079
Ravana’s heart?

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:12.079
Melting??

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:13.079
That’s the thing.

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:14.079
Keep people guessing!)

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:22.149
He gives the charioteer a golden amulet as
a gift, and bids him to take him back to the

00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:23.149
battlefield!

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:26.459
It is around this time, the Aditya Hridayam
prayer is given to Rama by Sage Agasthya.

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:27.459
Interesting moment!

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:31.889
Law Number 18:- Do not build fortresses to
protect yourself.

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:32.889
Isolation is dangerous!

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:37.509
Long ago, we used to hear stories of kings,
and the huge fortresses they had, … but

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:41.949
only recently I realised that the “Fortress”
was actually a metaphor.

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:46.550
It is not made of stones and rocks and cement
and concrete.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.550
No.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.839
It is made of people.

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:53.649
It is made of people who support you whatever
wrong you do.

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:58.139
A place without wise ministers who can criticise
you in safety.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:05.360
And that’s what happens when Ravana plans
his attack on the monkey army.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.279
“Bah, they are just disorganised monkeys.

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:12.180
We can crush them like cockroaches!

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.079
We have such a big army!

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.730
Haven’t we won that war?

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.570
Haven’t we done this?

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.410
Didn’t we kill that?!”

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.410
The sycophants.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.100
They are the fortress.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.519
They bring isolation.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:28.629
And that is dangerous.

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:32.779
Law Number 19:- Know who you’re dealing
with.

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:34.489
Do not offend the wrong person!

00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:38.209
That’s what the Samudhra God, the Ocean
God, did.

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:41.679
“Some small kid, this guy Rama, trying to
cross the ocean.

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:42.830
I am so massive.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.989
Why should I bother”…

00:15:43.989 --> 00:15:46.009
He thinks thus for just one moment.

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:48.759
And Rama says, it is either Taranam or Maranam.

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:50.249
Taranam is crossing.

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:54.239
Maranam is death… to the Ocean!

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:59.300
And then he takes his bow, and strings an
arrow on it..!

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.470
At the last moment, the Ocean God comes running
and begs, “I am sorry, all the living things

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.190
in water will die, oh, please don’t do this..

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.470
You want me to give you way, fine!

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.470
No problem!

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.100
In this route, if you form a bridge, I will
support it!”

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.589
says the Ocean God.

00:16:13.589 --> 00:16:18.480
Law Number 20:- Do not commit to anyone!

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.189
Some of you might have heard of this story
where Rama actually fights with Hanuman!

00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:26.429
Hanuman fights with Rama!

00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:32.100
The story goes that the King of Kashi commits
a mistake, Sage Vishwamithra complains to

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.670
Rama, and Rama says, “No problem, don’t
worry, I will get that guy, I will bring his

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:37.670
head”.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.440
The Kashi King doesn’t run to Hanuman.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.850
Instead, he goes to Hanuman’s mother!

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.329
“You have to save me, a king is chasing
me!”

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:49.260
“No problem, my son will take care”, says
Anjana Devi.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:57.819
And, that is when Hanuman realises that the
King who is chasing the Kashi King is Lord

00:16:57.819 --> 00:16:58.819
Rama himself!

00:16:58.819 --> 00:17:01.045
But, having given his word to his mother,
and realising that a word to one’s mother

00:17:01.045 --> 00:17:03.699
is bigger and greater than a word to anybody
else, including to Shri Ram himself, … there

00:17:03.699 --> 00:17:04.699
is a fight!

00:17:04.699 --> 00:17:08.150
The lesson here is, do not commit before understanding
what you are committing to, what you are committing

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.150
for!

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.230
Law Number 21:- Play a sucker to catch a sucker.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.819
Seem dumber than your mark!

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.620
Ravana performances a deep and long penance
and extracts boons aplenty.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.659
Kinnaras should not be able to kill me.

00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:21.689
Asuras should not be able to kill me.

00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:22.689
Not birds.

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:23.689
Nor animals.

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:24.689
Nor even can the Gods themselves.

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:29.649
He lists every living thing, but misses out
on mentioning human beings.

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:32.299
Humans are silly simple weak folk.

00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:33.610
Perhaps he saw them as inferior.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.409
Why would I even bother about being killed
by a paltry human being…

00:17:38.409 --> 00:17:39.409
That was his thought process.

00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:41.750
And, so, Lord Vishnu appears as a paltry human
being!

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.510
And delivers the coup de grace!

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.240
So, that’s what happened!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.960
Be careful.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.550
You may be playing a sucker, to catch a sucker!

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.230
That’s what Ram did!

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.000
Law Number 22:- Use the surrender tactic.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.720
Transform weakness into power!

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.670
There is this amazing movie called the Sampoorna
Ramayanam.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.490
A song with lyrics that go “Indru poi naalai
vaa ena enai oru manithanum pugaluvadho”…

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.490
and “mann magal mugam kandey manam kalankidum
nilai”…

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:20.960
He sings it, playing his Veena, in front of
the Shiva Linga.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.350
I saw the face of Goddess Earth.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.730
Till then, I had been bold and audacious,
and head held high!

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.070
A man, a plain man, did that to me!

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.429
Meanwhile, Rama thought, “Ravana is a great
king.

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:35.429
Powerful king.

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:45.529
What is the point killing such a king and
leaving Lanka headless?

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:49.909
If only Ravana changes his mind, he may be
a great king!

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:52.740
Why not give that chance”..

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.650
That is transforming weakness into power.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.350
That is a good attempt!

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.289
Law Number 23:- Concentrate your forces!

00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:10.850
When the plan was made to look for Sita, Sugreeva
sends forces in all directions.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.760
He sends extra forces to the South.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.580
For that was the direction Jatayu flew towards.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.570
That was the direction Ravana took Sita in.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.280
So, he sends Jambavan.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.980
He sends Hanuman too.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.299
So, concentrating your forces on the narrow…

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:32.890
Where is the maximum impact possible?

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.770
Concentrating it there is probably better!

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.080
Finally, Law Number 24:- Play the perfect
courtier!

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.440
There is this nuanced concept of “Respect
to the Court”.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.320
(The opposite of contempt of court!)

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.100
Viswamithra asks Dasharatha — give me your
sons, I want to train them, I want to use

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:57.530
them to fight away some Raakshasas who are
bothering me during my penance, during my

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.530
Yagna.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:07.130
Sage Vashishta, who is at the level of Vishwamithra’s
superboss, by the way, is seated next to Dasharatha.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.380
But, instead of overruling, he says, Vishwamithra
means well.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.210
He will surely have a reason.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:21.620
By asking King Dasharatha to act as per Vishwamithra’s
desires, Vashishta, who is actually in a position

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:28.210
to deny it, plays the perfect courtier, and
that is one of the reasons The Ramayana happens,

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:34.240
for that is why Rama is even able to meet
Sita and get married to her!

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.770
So, we have done twenty four of the forty
eight laws.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.740
Let me stop with a closing thought here.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.100
There are 24000 Shlokas in the Ramayana, incidentally.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:54.210
And interestingly, they are divided into 500
Sargas, or chapters.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.179
24000 couplets in 500 chapters…

00:20:57.179 --> 00:20:59.220
What does that mean?!

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.220
Hey!

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.220
Do the math?!

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.410
24000 divided by 500!

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.440
What number do you get?!

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.660
Catch my point?!

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.730
Probably there is a deep connection!

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:12.010
Once again, we will meet with a Part Two of
this!

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.789
Thank you!
