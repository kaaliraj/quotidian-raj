00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.780
I am going to give you a puzzle.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.460
A pretty famous puzzle.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.599
Let’s see if you can solve it!

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.099
Do you remember these Harry Potter Books?

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.860
Seven world-famous books?

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.770
Those books are arranged in order.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.800
From 1 to 7, in a book shelf like this.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.230
A bookworm… not the “bookworm” — the
guy or the girl who keeps reading books — not

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.740
them — but a real worm.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.740
The silverfish.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.370
It starts from the first page of the first
book and eats through to the last page of

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.570
the last book.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.399
The page counts of each book, 1 to 7, go like
this.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:02.510
The question to you is “How many pages does
the bookworm eat through?”

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.150
Can you let me know?!

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.680
Vanakkam.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.329
Four Hundred and Forty Two.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:27.780
I have called it “Putthagam”.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.180
And, I went looking.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.530
Pudhu Agam.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.530
Pudhuagam.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.530
Putthagam.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.510
We are entering into a new world.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.510
A new home.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.510
Could be!

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.260
What do you say?!

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.420
If you delve into the origin, you will realise
that it is Potthagam.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.500
There were a lot of HOLES.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.020
In the papyrus/parchment.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.320
Holes made by the writing instrument.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.570
That is where the name comes from.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.260
Putthagam.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.750
I have..

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390
I have to confess really..

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.530
I have a lifelong love affair with books.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:27.780
Any book I get my hands on anywhere, I used
to grab, read, and share.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.420
Once upon a time, believe it or not, running
out of space in my home to accommodate all

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.959
the books I had collected, we rented a house,
a 1bhk apartment nearby just to dump the books

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.800
that I had collected over the years.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.860
I have learned the lesson now, .. but, that
was how bad things were once upon a time.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.170
Books are really a porthole.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.930
A pathway to a new world.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.500
That author’s world.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.160
Probably the time the author lived in.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.260
Or, the world the author created for us.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.530
Like Lord of the Rings, probably.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:27.550
All of us, as children, we would have obsessed
over picture-books.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.260
And then, we start realising that our imagination
can provide better pictures.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.319
A child matures.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.080
A child has grown up.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.049
The very indication of this happening is when
the child moves from complaining “Hey, this

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.890
book has no pictures in it!”

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:57.590
to “Hey, why does this book have pictures
in it!”

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.709
I still remember Bram Stoker’s Dracula.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.689
That book had just words.

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.909
White paper.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.620
Black writing.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.150
English letters.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.970
Just 26 letters.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:25.530
But the scene that they depict, that they
recreate in my mind, I have watched so many

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.920
movies and TV series after that, but nothing
can hold a candle to the world that I created

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.410
myself, the world the author created for me
in my mind.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.560
Nothing can come close.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.380
I am sure you agree too.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.150
Books takes you to a world of their own.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:58.330
In today’s world, the high-tension low-attention-span
world, I think books are the last remaining

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:09.860
place where the whole story is told, but you
have to grind through in your own pace.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.789
You can’t speed it up.

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.210
Like you do in YouTube, 2x video speed..

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:24.610
Nor can you shake the mouse a bit and check
the red progress bar and find out how much

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.800
more there is before the end.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.390
However interesting and engrossing the video
might be..

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.000
I hate it when some people do that!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.020
This particular movie, a short movie, just
seven minutes, called Paperman!

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.940
I was playing this for a friend, and we wouldn’t
have crossed even half way, and they wanted

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.350
to move the mouse already!

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.770
How much more to go??

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.419
An antidote for this kind of disease?

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.169
Is the book.

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.639
The whole story is laid out there.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:53.639
Chapter by chapter.

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.729
It is waiting to unfold for you.

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.810
But, it will happen only in the speed with
which you read.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.740
You control the speed.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.140
You can jump back.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.729
You can pause.

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.220
You can think.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.310
You can resume.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.220
The story will wait.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:24.979
While thinking about the author, I also sometimes
feel the author must be … just like this

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.919
man.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.860
Twitter.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.800
Facebook.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.740
“Insta”Gram.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:51.340
This is the world we are growing up in.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.160
We get immediate feedback.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.500
We say something, and we get immediate feedback.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.819
If we post a blog on Medium, we get an applause
soon afterward.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.310
So that we can change immediately.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.370
Imagine the plight of the author!

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.960
They write the whole story with zero feedback.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.540
They don’t have any idea who is going to
like the story.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.919
They don’t have any idea whether they are
going to find a hole in the plot, whether

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:26.570
they are going to complain that the heroine
was cheated and misled.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.570
No!

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.849
They have no idea!

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:31.870
What a huge challenge this is!

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:40.090
To do something for so long, spend so much
time on, and create it in your own personal

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:48.240
private world, without any feedback, and then
you give it out into the world.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240
Amazing!

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.970
When you look at the evolution of the book,
.. it all started almost five thousand years

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.970
ago.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.990
On a stone tablet, people learned how to make
etchings and marks.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:06.370
Then, parchment and papyrus, found in the
banks of the River Nile, people found that

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.879
they could be pressed together, and you could
write on top of them.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.479
They lasted for a long time.

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:23.759
Then, they used the skin of young animals,
like calf skin, they started writing on parchment.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:26.980
Then along came paper and basic printing.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.990
Movable type.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:35.580
We could compose letters and print them and
so we could mass manufacture them into multiple

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580
copies.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.019
Till then, books were hand-copied.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:43.380
Only the rich people had access to it.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:50.700
But when this happened, Gutenberg’s printing
press arrived, for the first time, people,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.899
common man could have access to all kinds
of books and writing.

00:08:56.899 --> 00:09:04.990
Then, the paperback — the small hand-held
pocket book arrived.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:11.620
And only then, people started taking books
along with them, wherever they went.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.899
Till then, it was in a library.

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:19.860
With a special X-shaped book-holder.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.649
Then, around 1985, the concept of an ebook.

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:27.620
A tablet.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.250
Digitally stored.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.040
In 2007, 2011, we got the iPad.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:42.560
But, around 1985, the concept of an electronic
book that could store the book digitally was

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.000
born.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.930
And, innovations-wise, one very interesting
innovation is the audio-book.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:59.720
Audible.com was launched as a service in 1995,
and we were able to hear a book instead of

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.770
reading it.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.810
Great evolution.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:08.420
Even after such a long journey, some people
still say, “Nothing like a paper-book!

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.420
Sorry!”

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:18.300
I may be making some enemies today, but I
am going to tell you some of the reasons why

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.860
I think people should move to the world of
digital.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.740
To the world of bits.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.910
Two things that people often say — citing
these as the primary reasons why they haven’t

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.910
switched over to digital books.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.550
I used to ask a lot of my friends.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:37.579
And, they would shrug and say, “Sorry, I
prefer paperbooks!”

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:39.000
They give two reasons.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.550
Reason number one is — Irritation to the
eyes.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:49.040
We need to reduce screen time, you see, they
would quip.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.840
The answer to them is, Hey, reduce Instagram
time, reduce Facebook infinite dumb scrolling

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840
time.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.840
Which one?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.810
Have you forgotten the jar with rocks already?

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.050
Would anybody in their senses really stop
reading because of eye strain?!

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.490
That would be my instant response.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:17.690
The second reason they often quote is, “The
smell that comes when I take it close to my

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.690
nose..

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.690
Can you reproduce that?!”

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.230
There is even a word for it.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.709
That smell.

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:32.020
That odd smell that comes through the spine
of the book when you keep it close to your

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.020
nose.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.630
It is an addiction, my friend.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.740
Like when people get addicted to smelling
markers because it has a volatile compound

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.050
called toluene in it.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.770
Similarly, this has glue, and it reacts with
the paper, and it is an ADDICTION!

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:51.510
The first thought that strikes me whenever
somebody brings up the “special unique smell

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.980
of moldy books” is.. the instant reaction
from me is..

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.529
“What do you want to know about Dr. Albert
Einstein?

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:07.050
Do you want to know the inner workings of
the Theory of Relativity?

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:13.490
Or do you want to smell the perfume he had
before he went for a lecture!?”

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.640
Why are you buying books, my dear?

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.110
Just to smell them??

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:27.560
By the way, here are four reasons why I think
the electronic format, the digital format,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.550
is far far better.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.550
Reason Number One?

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.620
You can take it wherever you want.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.339
You can take it wherever you go.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.210
Because it occupies zero space.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.570
Literally zero space.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:45.949
At any point of time, I am reading probably
nine to ten books.

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:46.949
A book with my mom.

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:48.680
A book with my son.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.990
Three / Four books with the students at Zoho
Schools.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.990
A book all for myself.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.090
And, also, a book through audio format.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:03.120
But, I can do that wherever I am, because,
electronic books.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.279
And, what about Searchability?

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:14.990
In a particular book, a particular author,
at a particular location, would have used

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.100
a word.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.000
Can you spot that location for me?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.120
You paper-folks?!

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.339
Can you locate it?

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:27.199
Probably you’ll remember, somewhere in the
first half, etc.

00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:30.570
But, can you search across all the seven books?

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:37.019
Can you search and tell me, in the Harry Potter
Seven Book Collection, which is the first

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:40.990
time that the Avada Kedavra Curse is used?

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.380
I dare you!

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.279
You can’t!

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:49.959
That searchability comes only when it is truly
digital.

00:13:49.959 --> 00:14:00.410
And, in this Knowledge Age, Information Age,
the proof that you have really read and assimilated

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:05.970
something comes when you remember it, recall
it, chew cud on it back again.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:12.630
Otherwise you are not deriving the full benefit
of having read a book.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.110
The third reason is, it stays forever!

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.690
A paper book bends, tears, deteriorates.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:27.830
I even remember during college times — we
used to take xerox copies of books.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:33.190
And, once, along came an inspiring kid who
said he would take a xerox copy of a xerox

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.440
copy.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.490
Quality suffered.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.940
We couldn’t make out the letters.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:44.480
But, in the digital world, once a book is
created, it will stay forever.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.620
I remember an author on TV once..

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.610
About a book he had written about the King
Rajaraja Chola building the Tanjore Great

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.860
Temple.. and how that book was out of print
now..

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.860
He said that with much chagrin.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.779
It need not be out of print is the point.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:04.710
Because, it need not have gone to print.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:10.190
It could have been a truly multimedia digital
experience created once, and it will stay

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.300
forever.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.529
Won’t it?

00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:19.959
The fourth reason, my favourite reason, why
you have to move to the digital world, is

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:20.959
this.

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:24.070
We saw this in Quotidian 441 too.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.920
The Power of Others.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.920
With Others.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920
For Others.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920
From Others.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.880
That power.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:37.279
You remember Amazon Kindle.

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:43.820
It has an amazing feature, where, it will
tell you when you are reading a book, .. “So

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.240
many other readers who read this book liked
this particular passage much..

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.400
Most of them highlighted this part!”

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.450
How special.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.500
How beautiful.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.660
A social feature when reading.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:04.640
Goodreads — acquired by Amazon- it is a
great place where people recommend books and

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.740
booklists..

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:14.460
Selected content from digital books, highlighted,
shared..

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.300
I came across a service called Readwise.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.300
A friend recommended that to me.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:28.029
It digests all the highlights you make, in
any book reader, digital book reader, and

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.490
takes them into its mind.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:38.190
And daily, sends you a random digest of fifteen
chosen little snippets from the stuff that

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.420
you have read.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.709
We have encountered this concept earlier too.

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:47.630
If you practice spaced repetition, it will
become permanent in memory.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.769
And, Readwise helps you achieve that!

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:54.370
Not possible with paper books!

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.269
And, finally, an amazing service called Bookfusion.

00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:59.709
I am a member too.

00:16:59.709 --> 00:17:00.920
It is a library.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.670
I have a library of my own with my friends.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.949
So many of the books that we have encountered
in Quotidians till now, waiting there for

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:09.949
friends to share.

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:15.870
And, when they read those books, if they highlight
something, I get a notification.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.400
It is almost as if I read when they read..!

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.010
Vicarious, don’t they call it?

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:27.740
When they read it, I too, enjoy that, along
with them.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.809
These things are not possible in the world
of paper.

00:17:30.809 --> 00:17:35.450
So, welcome, to the digital world.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:42.390
As a closing thought, there is this person
named Pablo Neruda.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.010
He is a Nobel Laureate.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.990
Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature,
in 1971.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.030
He has written a poem…

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.300
Sounds a bit angry actually..

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.960
When I close a book, I open life.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.110
Book, let me go.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:15.760
I don’t come out of collected works, My
poems have not eaten poems, Their food is

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.510
out of earth and men.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.110
I learned about life from life itself.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:34.970
Love, I learned in a single kiss..!”

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:40.150
He compares the world of books and the world
as it really is.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.070
The poem is titled, “An Ode to the Book”.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.970
A song of praise, literally.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:54.590
But, Pablo Neruda, instead of praising the
book, he is a Chilean poet… has ravaged

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.710
the concept thus.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.440
Probably there is a message there.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.559
You have to come out of the book and meet
the world front on.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:16.270
Somebody once said, “He who has never traveled
the world, is stuck in the same page of a

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.270
book..”

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.530
Go, tour the world!

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:35.130
Alright, we will meet again later today, thank
you!
