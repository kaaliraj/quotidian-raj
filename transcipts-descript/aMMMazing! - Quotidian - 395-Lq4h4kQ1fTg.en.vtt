00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:12.650
It was the year 1902. A company founded in
that year! It has got more than 60,000 products.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:21.800
Individual products. From the very small to
the very large. From the daily commonplace

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.919
to those special components used in space
crafts… It has got one more credit! It is

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:36.829
probably the most “patented” company.
It has got… Recently it crossed that record…

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:46.539
100,000 patents! Their employees now hold,
for their products, for their processes, for

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:54.670
their technologies, 100,000 patents! Who is
this company? What can we learn from them?

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:17.330
Namaste! There is a little clue, hidden right
in the title. Did you get it? The name of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.390
that company.. M. M. M. Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing..! Hey! It’s our familiar

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.039
friend, 3M! What a famous company that is!?
We are going to talk about just this company

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.560
now!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.620
It started with a small rock — that is how
they recount the history of this company!

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.490
There was this mountainous region that this
company’s founders purchase. Hoping to mine

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.079
much from that, wanting to mine corundum,
a very hard substance, as hard as a diamond,

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.939
capable of even cutting through diamonds,
… that is how they start it. But, disaster

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:05.229
strikes very early! True credit to them that
they didn’t let this very early setback

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.590
to affect their business. It wasn’t corundum.
It was actually a mineral much lower in quality,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.010
called anarthosite. They get only this mineral…
But, without losing hope, how do they fight

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.470
back… How did they reinvent themselves…
How, even after a hundred and twenty years,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:41.420
3M stands as a symbol for innovation and quality…?
What is the story behind it? A company that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.530
started like this, 3M, when Neil Armstrong,
the first human to set foot on moon, when

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.230
he places his first famous footstep on the
moon, “A small step for man, a giant leap

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:03.870
for mankind”, the sole of the shoe he used,
the special rubber used for it, was manufactured

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.250
by 3M! How did they make this jump?

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:18.930
Scotch is a special brand name owned by 3M.
(Not Scotch Whiskey). But, Scotch Tape. Used

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.120
for masking on automobiles. Masking is a very
important task. Because, when you want to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.450
paint two colours on an automobile, one paint
shouldn’t bleed on to the other, and so

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.920
they mask it. The masking tape should not
leave any residue, should stick well, … These

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.451
salespersons had gone to sell the tape, and
the car mechanics had ripped off the tape

00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:51.660
disgustedly in front of the salespeople, and
told them, “Go give it to your Scottish

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:03.220
bosses, ask them to make it better, and come
back!” (Because, in those days, the word

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:12.620
“Scottish” was used derogatorily, to represent
people who were stingy, who weren’t bothered

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.319
about quality, etc… How did THAT brand name,
that rejected brand name, become so famous

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.150
as one of the best tapes in the world?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:32.300
How did THAT company manage to somehow get
on to the hands of Steve Jobs? Every iPhone

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.300
and every iPad that was launched in the first
six seven years of the Apple saga, that thin

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.990
film on the top of the glass, those touch-sensitive
gestures, from swipe to tap, from touch to

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:57.590
drag, how did they happen? Because of film
from 3M! How did the “Scotch” brand…

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.290
how was it able to make this leap on to Steve
Jobs’ hand? It has to be magic!

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:13.139
And, that magic is captured in this book.
It is called A Century of Innovation. I am

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.990
not sure who actually wrote this book. So
many people have contributed to it. It is

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.900
a company book. A book by the folks from the
company for the folks in the company! But,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:35.220
it is such a beautiful study! Such a historic
account of all kinds of ingredients that go

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.379
into innovation, invention, collaboration,
and sustenance. If something has to go on

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:49.159
and on and on for ever, what are needed? These
are needed! Little bits, here and there, we

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:57.759
have already seen in some other Quotidians,
but if one company, so far ahead of its time,

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:04.830
many many decades ago, if they have managed
it, surely they are worth being praised, and

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:12.319
surely they are worth being emulated. We need
to copy a lot from here! Pay attention!

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:18.819
The first thing that struck me in this book,
there is this phrase called “Patient Money”!

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:27.270
Is there an amazing idea? A stellar product?
A spellbinding technology? Is there too much

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:34.050
friction and resistance internally towards
that? But… Do YOU feel that this is something

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:42.789
worth pursuing, something worth encouraging?
Go ahead! Do it! The company will take care!

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:50.410
The company will protect you! Because, they
seem to know that the Patient Money… some

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.509
things yield fruit only when you let it take
its own time.. Months, years, let it soak

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:04.240
in and eventually bloom. You cannot speed
up innovation. Beyond a point, speeding it

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.099
up will kill it! This seems to have been deeply
embedded into their psyche, according to this

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:16.530
book. So many products, from their taping
products to their new adhesives, they have

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:27.699
always encouraged people to just “Keep at
it” and have a “Go at it”. If you are

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:36.210
confident, you should not bother that there
is resistance around you. Patient Money!

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:43.479
The second concept that seemed to appeal to
me is this thing about managing people. We

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:48.839
have already seen a variety of different approaches
in a variety of different companies. Nothing

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:55.250
new, under the sun. But, so many years ago,
when management wasn’t even a discipline,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.850
when I realise that this company has already
innovated in the right people processes, it

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:07.960
fills me with wonderment! William McKnight
was among the first CEOs. He, way back, a

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:16.349
hundred and ten years ago, he talks about
delegating responsibility. If you have reached

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:23.130
a position, start thinking about how can you
give away all the other roles. Because, people

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:32.450
under you need to be told that they are trusted.
That they are tolerated. That they are actually

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:40.760
being given the freedom to innovate in the
way they want to. We have already seen the

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.640
famous triplet of words — “How”, “Why”,
“What”. In that context, “How you get

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.400
something done is up to you, I am not going
to micromanage you” is the trust you need

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.460
to give the people under you… They are not
going to be happy being told how to get something

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:03.080
done. They want to be told what is needed.
Sometimes, they don’t even want to be told

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:10.910
that! They just want to be shown the why.
They will take care of the how!

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:18.810
The third interesting aspect that kind of
popped out to me was how they fostered innovation.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:28.590
They have this lab. Research lab. Some of
the scientists in that research lab will go

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:36.090
fishing on a Thursday afternoon. Doesn’t
matter. Because, over the long run, they would

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:43.010
work on a Sunday night and anyway, make up
for it. Also, innovation cannot be measured

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:52.600
in clock hours. We know that very well! And,
when somebody has a product idea, when somebody

00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:01.460
is passionate, when somebody is passionately
creative, just leave them be. We don’t know

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:08.660
when the next Post-It! notes is going to come
along! (We will be revisiting these Post-It!

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:15.210
notes in a while…!) It was such a path-breaking
innovation for 3M! A failed innovation! When

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.580
everybody was relegating it to the trash bin,
thinking what earthly use can come of it,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.820
other opportunities were discovered, dug up,
and the invention was revived! So, who knows

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:32.180
what else is going to pop up when you least
expect it! Beware, is the message this book

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.180
gives us.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:43.040
We have talked about 20% time at Google. Where
they famously allow you to experiment, to

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.620
pursue your own passion, to do a side-project.
But, you know where that came from? That came

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:58.320
from 15% time at 3M. 15% time at 3M came right
after the Second World War. 1948! Imagine,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:10.750
in 1948, they are saying, 15% of your time,
chase your own dream, just go ahead! Cellophane

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:18.060
tape was born like that. Cannibalisation of
ideas! If something is happening the company,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:25.000
and competitors are threatening to eat it
up, 3M would say, don’t allow the competition

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.140
to eat it up, come up with our own product
that cannibalises this one. It is not just

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:40.820
for saving face! Our own product will get
new business from the death of our own product!

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:47.730
Isn’t that amazing?! There is a heat-resistant
paint. It has been invented already. But,

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:53.010
there seems to be no market around for it.
Why? Because, all these years, instead of

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:59.160
a heat-resistant paint, they have been using
a heat-resistant cover to protect the car

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:06.200
till now. Who brought this cover to market?
3M! Cannibalisation! Heat-resistant paint

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:15.450
from 3M cannibalised heat-resistant cover
from 3M! There will be disagreement. If you

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:21.660
are a technologist, if you are a scientist,
it is okay if management disagrees with you!

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:29.620
Go ahead. Do it on your 15% time. Come next
month. Do a demo. Win your case. And share

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.840
your dream! That was the message in the book.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:42.182
Meet this man. Richard Drew. He was a senior
scientist. A scientist among scientists. A

00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:49.690
scientist who was herding a lot many other
scientists. One of his greatest inventions,

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:57.230
of course, was cellophane. Scotch tape. The
scientist who invented cellophane. While putting

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:04.520
his team together, he made it very clear.
Hire for creativity. Hire creative people.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:14.000
Hey, don’t get me Ph.Ds. Hire creative people.
Yeah, we can always hire a Ph.D for the nitty-gritty

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.110
details. Did you listen to that?! Because,
he felt, education, higher education, the

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:29.350
more educated somebody became, the more rigid
they ended up being in their thought process,

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:36.760
and we need out of the box thinkers. So, hire
for creativity, we can get Ph.Ds for the nitty-gritties

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.410
anyway, later..!

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:49.620
When talking about innovation, 3M had this
very clear message, very important message,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:56.810
transferred to every member in the company.
Innovation and Invention — there is a big

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:01.960
difference. Invention is finding something
out. But, it becomes an innovation only when

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.860
it touches the lives of customers in a positive
way. It should change their hearts. It should

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.030
introduce progress in their lives. It should
empower them to do things that they couldn’t

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:19.600
do till now. That is when it can be counted
as an innovation. This, for example, is the

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:26.000
first artificial track. A running track. 3M
made the first synthetic track for the Olympics.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.250
They called it Tartan Track. Made of urethane.
They used a rubber component to create this

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:40.920
track. Nozari was the person who invented
this. Nozari goes to his boss, George Allen,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.440
and says, “I have done this. I have finished.
What do I do next?!” To which George is

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:52.410
supposed to have chased him off with a response
like this: “Finished? No! No way! Not at

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:59.070
all! Go to every division in the company!
Go to every department! Show them what you

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:07.131
have got! And find out where else this will
be useful! Where else, this new compound that

00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:12.710
you have invented in the lab, can be useful!”.
Perhaps that is why, the same chemical compound

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:24.500
found in the Tartan Track is being used as
a surgical brush. The sponge used in this

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.910
surgical brush is made of the same material
that makes the Tartan Track! So, same chemical

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:39.160
— completely different environment, completely
different use, only because, invention is

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:48.860
easy, innovation is a longterm process, and
requires interaction, collaboration with people.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:56.250
When employees look at 3M, they see it as
a very big sandbox. A playground. Almost every

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:03.060
scientist in the book says, “It is an experimental
laboratory for us. Even if you pay the same

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:13.180
salary, you can’t give the freedom, the
spirit of innovation that I see here”. “Sixty

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.620
percent of the experiments that we try in
this research laboratory fail! They don’t

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:26.310
hit mainstream! Sixty percent of them fail!
And the key benefit here, in this laboratory,

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:33.540
is we don’t attach failure to the individual.
We don’t punish the people who actually

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:39.670
failed in that experiment. We almost wear
it with pride and honour, like wounds of battle!

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:47.940
See how many failures I have survived!”
Phone calls used to arrive to this research

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:55.770
lab. The book talks about a specific call.
“From the Wisconsin plant of 3M, we received

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:03.520
a phone call. And, we were told to visit this
plant and spend three days. We were told that

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.870
nobody will tell us what to look for. We can
meet with the employees, they will be ready

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:14.799
to answer any of our questions. Look around.
Find out what’s to be done. After three

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:20.610
days, their employees will be waiting to listen
to us and follow our guideline. We were supposed

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:25.919
to tell them what has to be changed for them
to become more productive and more innovative.”

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:33.009
They were like a flying squad within the company.
They were like a research lab who would get

00:17:33.009 --> 00:17:43.350
phone calls with a blank cheque. Just go and
find out what can be improved! Imagine!

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:51.200
The book also talks about important types
of people that any person or any project needs

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:59.870
for it to really succeed. First, you need
a Mentor. A Mentor is typically really charged

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:05.820
up about a technology or process, and seeing
you involved in it, says, “Come, Let me

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:16.159
teach it to you. I will be your Guru”. A
Sponsor is actually in love with that amazing

00:18:16.159 --> 00:18:20.809
product you are trying to build. Because,
if you bring out something amazing, that is

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:27.049
good for the Sponsor too. So, I will do my
best to help you! I will sponsor this because

00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:35.710
the results will help me also! The Champion?
Well, this person is in love… with YOU!

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:43.120
“You are so amazing, if you succeed, I will
be happy, I am ready to be the person who

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.379
will push you forward. Whatever you do, I
am in love with you, I am so thrilled about

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:55.090
the potential that you have, let us make YOU
happen!” says the Champion. So, the Mentor

00:18:55.090 --> 00:19:00.879
is in love with the technology, a Sponsor
is in love with the final product you are

00:19:00.879 --> 00:19:05.840
building, a Champion is in love with you.
These three kinds of people… some count

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:12.409
themselves lucky if they get one such..! And
3M is famous for building an environment that

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:15.769
makes all three possible!

00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:25.149
Were there any negatives? Across that book..
The 110 years of that book… for many many

00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:33.029
years, I saw only photographs of men. No women.
And, photographs of only white men. Why? Couldn’t

00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:41.200
they get any other kinds of people for innovation
and leadership roles? A dull prick in my conscience

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.700
once in a while… as I flipped through that
book.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.539
Similarly, the book talked much about patents.
Patents are good, yes. A hundred thousand

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:59.590
patents — amazing. But, it looked to me
that they took it too far. Guess how far they

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:07.590
took it?? They have patented this colour!
Canary Yellow! The colour! How can somebody

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.309
patent a colour?? Come on! Seemingly, when
people see this, they are immediately reminded

00:20:11.309 --> 00:20:20.769
of Post-It! notes, and Post-It! meant 3M,
and so… but how fair is it to patent a colour

00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:21.769
itself?!

00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:30.350
Also, it didn’t always work! All the great
innovations, all the amazing processes they

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:39.610
had, didn’t help them escape this attack
by Xerox. 3M was manufacturing thermally coated

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:50.149
paper. They were in love, they were enamoured
by it, that they didn’t notice Xerox creeping

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:56.220
in with “I don’t need any special paper.
Any paper in! I will print it as a copy on

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:07.159
any paper! Because I have magic in the lenses
and the laser internally!” 3M never understood.

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:14.129
They fought a losing battle for many many
decades against Xerox, and finally lost. So,

00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:21.879
they have lost too… And, credit to them
— they talk about that too, in the book!

00:21:21.879 --> 00:21:28.320
As a closing thought, one interesting line
that the original CEO talks about, McKnight

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:37.860
talks about, remained in my mind. He used
to take samples to factories, in his horse-carriage.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:44.821
But, he would not just go to the front-office,
talk to the bosses, share samples, and go

00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:54.429
home. He, (and he would encourage his colleagues
to too!), to go behind the smokestacks! Find

00:21:54.429 --> 00:22:02.830
out what’s happening there. Where the real
work is happening. Where the real workers

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:13.730
are. That is where you would get the real
feedback. So, I think that is a very important

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:22.870
lesson that is relevant even today. If you
are a product creator, go behind the smokestacks.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:28.440
Ask people who will really be using it, and
ask for feedback from them. Alright! We will

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.330
meet on May 30th! Thank you!
